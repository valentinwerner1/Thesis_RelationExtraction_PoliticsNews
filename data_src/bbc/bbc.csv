0,"At least 23 people have been killed and dozens more injured in a Russian rocket strike on a civilian convoy in south Ukraine, local officials say.A huge crater next to a row of vehicles in the city of Zaporizhzhia testifies to the violence of the attack. Windows and windscreens were smashed in.The BBC saw half a dozen bodies lying at the scene, apparently civilians. Baggage and coats strewed the tarmac. One survivor told the BBC her boss had been killed in the attack.""She had two kids. I left the cafe to use the restroom when it happened. I ran back and tried to find her. The cafe was demolished, there were many bodies around. It was all so very horrifying,"" Viktoriia Yosypenko said.Reacting to the attack in the early hours of Friday on the outskirts of the regional capital of the Zaporizhzhia region, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia was a ""state-terrorist"".He said Russia launched 16 rockets on the city, and vowed to punish perpetrators for ""every lost Ukrainian life"".Meanwhile, a Russian-installed local official blamed Ukraine for the attack.The convoy was hit as people were preparing to travel to the Russian-occupied part of the region to pick up their relatives and also deliver humanitarian aid.Tears and despair as Russian annexation loomsNear the missile's impact crater, the BBC spoke to Kateryna Holoborod, sat on her suitcase in a state of shock. 'We arrived in a line, to join a column going towards Kherson,"" she said. ""We got out to see what number we had in the queue. Then the first rocket hit, behind the wagons. ""We dropped to the ground. Then the second one hit in the centre of the queue. There was glass everywhere, people screaming and running. I don't remember much. ""It was very scary. I then got up to see what happened, help the injured. I tried to help an injured young man when the third explosion happened.""The attack comes as Russian President Vladimir Putin is preparing for a signing ceremony in Moscow to annex Zaporizhzhia along with Ukraine's Donetsk, Luhansk and Kherson regions.The move follows self-styled referendums in the eastern and southern regions, which have been condemned by Ukraine and the West as a sham.Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February, and Moscow currently controls the majority of the Zaporizhzhia region, including Europe's biggest nuclear power plant there - but not the regional capital.Moscow-installed regional official Vladimir Rogov blamed ""Ukrainian militants"" for the Zaporizhzhia attack, Russian state-run media reported.In a separate development, one person was killed and five injured in overnight Russian strikes by Iskander missiles on the central city of Dnipro, about 70km (43 miles) north of Zaporizhzhia, local officials said.They said a transport company was targeted, and as many as 52 buses were burnt and another 98 damaged.Several high-rise buildings, offices and a shop were also hit.You may also be interested in: ",By James Waterhouse in Zaporizhzhia and Yaroslav Lukov in London,Ukraine war: Survivors speak of horror as Zaporizhzhia convoy hit
1,"About 20 members of a Jewish sect held at a facility in Mexico after a police raid on their jungle base have fled.Footage showed men, women, and children streaming out of the site in Huixtla, in the west, on Wednesday night.They had been there since the raid last Friday when two members were arrested on suspicion of human trafficking and serious sexual offences.The sect, Lev Tahor, is known for extremist practices and imposing a strict regime on its followers.It advocates child marriage, inflicts harsh punishments even for minor transgressions and requires women and girls as young as three years old to completely cover up with robes.Local media said members of the group had been protesting against their detention since their arrival, including rioting and assaulting personnel.Video from Reuters news agency shows the detainees, dressed in gold, grey and white robes, forcing their way past two guards at a gate as one of their members holds it open.One of the guards trying to hold them back falls down and the group climb over him as they make their escape. A youth is seen turning and kicking the guard as he lies on the ground.  It is unclear where the group has gone. Associated Press said they were collected by a lorry and headed towards the border with Guatemala, while news site El Heraldo de México said they went by foot for several miles before disappearing into the night.Their compound, 11 miles (17.5km) north of Tapachula in Chiapas state, was raided by an elite police unit after a months-long investigation and surveillance operation involving Mexican and Guatemalan authorities and a private four-man team from Israel including former Mossad and domestic intelligence agents.Twenty-six members were found at the site, among them Israelis with dual citizenships including Canada, the US and Guatemala, Israel's foreign ministry said.It said a Canadian and an Israeli citizen were arrested, while two other wanted members reportedly left the compound two days before the raid and are being sought. Five more were detained for allegedly breaking immigration rules.The operation stemmed from an appeal to a former member of Israel's domestic intelligence agency, Shin Bet, by a former member of the sect, Yisrael Amir.Mr Amir fled the group's base in Guatemala in 2020, having to leave his then one-year-old son there.His son was released in the raid last week and flown back to Israel with his father.The group had lived in Guatemala since 2014, but in January members illegally crossed into Mexico, settling in the jungle. The leadership in Guatemala has been at the centre of a kidnapping case since 2018. Nine of the sect's members have been charged, four of whom have so far been convicted. Lev Tahor - Hebrew for Pure of Heart - was formed in Israel in 1988 and is thought to number up to 350 members, according to an ex-members group.It has been forced to move from country to country in recent years after coming under scrutiny from local authorities. It is currently spread between Israel, the US, North Macedonia, Morocco, Mexico and Guatemala. Between 70 and 80 members are still in Guatemala.While the group is often described as ultra-Orthodox, it follows its own sets of rules and has been declared a ""dangerous cult"" by an Israeli court.Its leaders have denied breaking local laws and say the group is being targeted because of its beliefs.",By Raffi Berg,Lev Tahor Jewish sect members held in Mexico escape
2,"The European Union has agreed to impose emergency measures to charge energy firms on their record profits.Ministers have agreed windfall taxes on certain energy companies as well as mandatory cuts in electricity use.The plan includes a levy on fossil fuel firms' surplus profits and a levy on excess revenues made from surging electricity costs. The cash raised is expected to go to families and businesses.But the bloc is divided on whether and how to cap the wholesale price of gas.It comes as Europe braces itself for a difficult winter due to the cost of living crisis and squeeze on global energy supplies.What is the windfall tax on oil and gas companies?Germany vows €65bn package to combat energy crisisThe bloc is largely trying to wean itself off Russia energy but it has left it scrambling for other alternative, expensive, sources.A windfall tax is imposed by a government on a company to target firms that were lucky enough to benefit from something they were not responsible for - in other words, a windfall profit. Energy firms are getting much more money for their oil and gas than they were last year, partly because demand has increased as the world emerges from the pandemic and more recently because of supply concerns due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.EU ministers estimate that they can raise €140bn (£123bn) from the levies on non-gas electricity producers and suppliers that are making larger-than-usual profits from the current demand.Earlier this month, the European Commission's vice-president, Frans Timmermans, said that fossil fuel extractors will be told to give back 33% of their surplus profits for this year. ""The era of cheap fossil fuels is over. And the faster we move to cheap, clean and homegrown renewables, the sooner we will be immune to Russia's energy blackmail,"" he said.""A cap on outsize revenues will bring solidarity from energy companies with abnormally high profits towards their struggling customers,"" he added. Earlier this week, 15 member states, including France and Italy, asked the EU to impose a price cap on gas bills to slow the soaring costs. A decision has not yet been announced on a price cap. ""There is big disappointment that in the proposal that is on the table there is nothing about gas prices,"" Polish climate minister Anna Moskwa said.Ms Moskwa said a maximum price for gas would be supported by the majority of European countries and ""cannot be ignored"". In the UK, former Chancellor Rishi Sunak introduced a similar tax to Friday's EU agreement in May, which he called the Energy Profits Levy.It was applied to profits made by companies from extracting UK oil and gas, but not those that generate electricity from sources such as nuclear or wind power.

3,"A suicide attack at a tuition centre in the Afghan capital Kabul has killed at least 19 people, most of them female students, police and witnesses say.Nearly 30 others were wounded at the Kaaj education centre in the Dasht-e-Barchi area in the west of the city.Students had been sitting a practice university exam when the bomber struck. No group has yet claimed the attack.Many of those in the area are minority Hazaras, who have often been targeted by Islamic State (IS) militants.Footage on local TV and shared on social media appeared to show scenes from a nearby hospital, where rows of covered bodies were laid out on the floor. Other media reportedly from the site of the private college showed rubble and upturned tables in the damaged classrooms.""We didn't find her here,"" a woman who was looking for her sister at one of the hospitals told AFP news agency. ""She was 19 years old."" Some reports say the number of dead is far higher than Taliban officials have acknowledged. The attacker is reported to have shot at the guards outside the centre, entered a classroom and detonated a bomb.Eyewitnesses told the BBC that most of the victims were girls - they were seated in the front row, near the blast. A student who was wounded told AFP that there were around 600 people in the room when the attack happened. The Kaaj tuition centre is a private college which teaches both male and female students. Most girls' schools in the country have been closed since the Taliban returned to power in August last year, but some private schools are open.Hazaras, most of whom are Shia Muslims, are Afghanistan's third largest ethnic group.

The pupils too afraid to return to schoolSunnis and Shia: Islam's ancient schismThe secret girls school defying the TalibanOn Friday the Taliban's interior ministry spokesman said security teams were at the site and condemned the attack.Abdul Nafy Takor said attacking civilian targets ""proves the enemy's inhuman cruelty and lack of moral standards"". The attack was also strongly condemned by the United Nations and the US. ""Targeting a room full of students taking exams is shameful; all students should be able to pursue an education in peace and without fear,"" said Karen Decker, charge d'affaires at the US mission to Afghanistan, in a tweet. The security situation in Afghanistan, which had improved after the end of fighting following the Taliban takeover, has been deteriorating in recent months, with a number of attacks on civilians but also Taliban supporters. Some have been claimed by IS, which is a bitter rival of the Taliban.Schools and hospitals have been targeted in the Dasht-e-Barchi area in a series of attacks, most of which are thought to have been the work of IS.Last year - before the Taliban returned to power - a bomb attack on a girls school in Dasht-e-Barchi killed at least 85 people, mainly students, and wounded hundreds more.",BBC News,Kabul blast kills teenagers sitting practice exam
4,"A rights group has called on Fifa to ban Iran from this year's World Cup after blocking women from watching games in their own country.Open Stadiums questioned why the country was being allowed to compete while ""Iranian women remain locked out of our 'Beautiful Game'"" by officials.The call comes weeks after women were allowed to attend a domestic match for the first time since 1979.However, the rights group was sceptical stadiums would remain open to women.""Iranian women trust neither the Islamic Republic's authorities nor the Iranian Football Federation that the Azadi stadium will remain open to them after the Fifa World Cup 2022 concludes on December 18,"" Open Stadiums said in an open letter to Fifa's president, Gianni Infantino.It also argues that even those who travel to Qatar to watch matches risk falling foul of Iranian authorities, with fears state spies may keep tabs on those who attend.Prohibiting women from games goes against international football rules, the letter points out, arguing Fifa should ""immediately expel Iran from the World Cup 2022 in Qatar"" as a result.What happens when sport and politics collide in IranIranian news sites reported speculation that women were allowed to attend the match in August after Fifa sent a letter to authorities calling on them to permit more women into stadiums. Fifa has previously told the BBC it would not ""turn its eyes"" away from the issue.There is no official ban on women going to sporting events in Iran, but it is rare as they are often refused entry.Prior to this, women had effectively been barred from domestic matches where men are playing due to clerical disapproval under the Shia Muslim regime. Women have attended a handful of international matches, including one in March this year, news agency Reuters reports.The rights group, which campaigns for equal access to sport in Iran, also claimed in the letter that members of the football team going to Qatar later this year had been banned from speaking out over deadly protests currently rocking the country. They were sparked by the death in custody of a young woman, Mahsa Amini, after she was detained morality police.The letter points out that the detention centre where she died is the same one ""where female fans are usually brought to and tortured if we dare to try to attend a football game"".Neither the Iranian football association or Fifa have responded to a request for comment from Reuters.",By Flora Drury,Iran: Fifa called on to ban country from World Cup over women's rights

Noah said he was ""filled with gratitude for the journey"" but that there was ""another part of my life that I want to carry on exploring"".The 38-year-old has hosted the satirical news and talk show since taking over from Jon Stewart in 2015. He said the timing of his departure would be announced later and that he would continue as host in the meantime. Noah began his career in his native South Africa, releasing a string of stand-up specials and hosting a late-night talk show before relocating to the US in 2011. He was still a relative unknown when he was chosen to take over the Daily Show on the Comedy Central network, but has since become an internationally-recognised star and won numerous television awards. Noah made the announcement at the end of his show on Thursday night, prompting shocked gasps from the studio audience.He thanked the show's crew and loyal fans for an ""amazing seven years"", adding: ""It's been wild, truly wild"". ""I remember when we first started... so many people didn't believed in us,"" he said. ""[Appointing me as host] was a crazy bet to make. I still think it was a crazy choice, this random African.

6,"Every day, convoys of people arrive in a supermarket car park in Zaporizhzhia city, escorted in by police vehicles. They've made the hazardous trip out of Russian-occupied territory in southern Ukraine, finally reaching the relative safety of this regional capital still firmly under Ukrainian control.And yet this is one of four Ukrainian regions that Russia is formally annexing, after a five-day exercise it called a referendum and Ukraine and the West condemned as a sham.Among those handing their papers to police is Anton Osenev, who says the Russians tried to mobilise him twice to fight against his own country, around his home city of Melitopol. ""We weren't home for the first attempt,"" he says. ""On the second occasion they stayed at our house for some time"". Had it not been for his pregnant wife being in the room, they would have taken him, he believes. His father is in the Ukrainian army, and if he had been seized he would have been on the opposite side.""I still don't understand what's happening, we need some rest.""Few here care about Moscow's declaration of annexation.  What they are afraid of is what the occupiers will do now to defend what they've taken - whether that is being forced to fight for Russia, or Moscow resorting to more lethal weapons.Last week Vladimir Putin threatened to use all resources at his disposal, even nuclear weapons.For the Kremlin, that's the very point - to create uncertainty over what comes next.As you drive south towards the front line from Zaporizhzhia city, the roads seem to empty.Fewer people walk along the roadside. A car or military vehicle occasionally speeds by. You don't go for leisurely drives around here.What you do get more of are military checkpoints. Ukrainian forces use them to control who gets through, and work out who is coming from the direction of Russian-occupied territory. After our military escort gets us through, we're met with an open, straight road.Half an hour later we arrive at the village of Komyshuvakha, a small settlement in the Ukrainian outback.A handful of damaged buildings hug a wide, straight highway. Most windows are boarded up. On this autumnal afternoon it's almost silent. If we carried on driving for 11 miles, we'd encounter a Russian checkpoint. An area Moscow now sees as its new ""border"" with Ukraine. Despite the region's capital staying under Ukrainian control, Russian forces control most of the Zaporizhzhia region. Today's annexation announcement is a continuation of their attempts to make their presence seem just. For those we meet in Komyshuvakha, nothing seems fair.One of them is Liubov Smyrnova. She tearfully takes us to a burnt-out shell which was once her home. It was hit by a missile in May. She's only just felt able to return. ""I think that Putin's politics is to destroy us, it's a genocide of our people,"" she tells me, while sifting through fragments of shrapnel. ""We are under constant pressure. I can't even describe it with words. Komyshuvakha is shelled almost every day.""Most people are inside because strikes tend to happen in the middle of the day, we're told. For now, the sound of birdsong and the occasional bark of a dog masks what has happened to this small community. It dawns on you that it's mostly women left here. The men of Komyshuvakha are mostly fighting, or just elsewhere.Around the corner, we speak to three women outside the building they've lived in for 70 years. Their eyes moisten as the strain of life here bubbles to the surface. ""Winter is coming and there's not a single window in the house,"" they explain, often talking over each other. ""It's like we're sitting on a powder keg."" So, what do they make of Russia's claim to half of the region they live in?""There should be a free and independent Ukraine,"" they say. ""We didn't attack anyone, didn't hurt anyone, and didn't want anything. We want to live the way we did before.""Behind a fire escape door in an empty kindergarten, there's activity. Through it are three women busily washing potatoes and cooking pancakes. They don't know who they're cooking for, they say, just that the Ukrainian military instructs them to. As she stirs batter in a large bowl, I ask Anzhela whether she cares that Russia now sees her village as being close to its new ""border"".""We don't want that,"" she says. ""We want to live the way we lived. Everything was fine, everything was all right."" She whisks with a bit more vigour. ""We grew up this way. Our children grew up this way and our grandchildren too."" ",By James Waterhouse,Ukraine war: Zaporizhzhia locals flee Russia annexation
7,"Australia has said it will end mandatory Covid isolation requirements from next month.Currently anyone who tests positive to the virus must isolate for five days, but that will end from 14 October.At times nicknamed ""Fortress Australia"", the country has had some of the strictest restrictions in the world since the pandemic began. Australia's chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, said the ""emergency phase"" of its response was probably over. But Prof Kelly said the decision ""does not in any way suggest that the pandemic is finished"".Mandatory isolation had been one of the few restrictions remaining. Australia continues to record about 5,500 virus cases each day, official figures show. It is one of the world's most vaccinated countries.Prof Kelly said the country would see ""future peaks"" of the virus, but it currently had ""very low"" numbers of hospital admissions and aged-care outbreaks.The Australian Medical Association opposes the change, saying those who pushed for it are not ""scientifically literate"" and are putting lives at risk.About 15,000 people have died with the virus in Australia - fewer than many nations. The vast majority have happened this year after the country opened up. Australia had closed international borders for around two years and imposed strict limits on movement around the country.Australia revisited - a country changed by CovidIs Australia still a Covid success story?

8,"Women working at Australia's research camps in Antarctica have endured widespread sexual harassment, a report has found.It described evidence of uninvited touching, requests for sex, and a predatory culture which condoned pornography on walls and sexual taunts.Woman also felt they had to hide their menstruation, and ration tampons and pads because they were so limited.Officials have condemned the findings and vowed to bring on cultural change.Australia's Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek said she was ""gobsmacked"" by the independent review of Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) sites. It was instigated after individuals made complaints.""As a minister, I take a zero-tolerance response to sexual harassment in any workplace I am responsible for,"" Ms Plibersek told the Australian Broadcasting Corp (ABC).Australia's Antarctic sites are located on the continent's eastern edge, and include the Casey, Davis and Mawson research stations. During the summer up to 500 expeditioners can be dispatched there, but during winter months the camps are reduced to about 15-30 key workers. Those workers - including doctors, chefs, and field officers - typically spend a year living at a station.Women in the camps felt like they couldn't escape or get immediate help due to the remote and isolated environment, said the report's author Meredith Nash, a professor at the Australian National University.They ""have to work in the fields with their abusers for weeks at a time because they simply can't leave"", she told the ABC, which first reported the findings on Friday.""Or, because of the power dynamics, they are not in a position to make a complaint or get support immediately as they would do back home,"" she added.Sex harassment rife in Australia parliament - reportThe long-lasting effects of workplace sexual harassmentThe report also found a homophobic culture among the male-dominated field, and said people feared speaking out because they didn't want to be excluded from future expeditions.In such a masculine environment, women scientists felt pressure to hide their periods out of fear of male judgement, the review said.Women also had to ""go through a gatekeeper to access free menstrual products"" with a voucher request system, reflecting a lack of adequate support in basic camp infrastructure.

Lawyer Mourad Elajouti wrote on Facebook that he had issued a legal warning to Adidas, on behalf of Morocco's Ministry of Culture.In a letter to the company's chief executive Kasper Rorsted, Mr Elajouti said the new design was cultural appropriation and ""an attempt to steal a form of Moroccan cultural heritage and use it outside its context"".He has demanded the German sportswear brand remove the design within two weeks.Mr Elajouti added that Algeria's 2022-2023 season kit ""contributes to the loss and distortion of the identity and history of these [zellige] cultural elements"".The BBC has contacted Adidas for comment.Algeria and Morocco share a nearly 2,000 km (1,242 miles) border, which has been a source of tension since independence from French colonial rule.In 1963, they had the Sand War over Morocco's claim to territory in Algeria.

He says ""it is not likely that the Russians detonated their own pipeline. They could have simply cut-off gas to the pipeline entrance"" if they wanted to stop supplies.The money Russia continues to receive for its fossil fuels is helping fund its invasion of Ukraine. The gas escaping from the pipeline near the Danish island of Bornholm has been in the pipe since the beginning of September when Moscow closed it off, saying repairs were needed to a vital artery in supplying Europe's energy needs. Ms Granholm suggested the energy relationship between Russia and Europe was being consigned to history.""I think Russia has proven itself to be an unreliable energy partner,"" she said.""No country wants to take the risk of putting a significant amount of its energy demand to Russia's supply. I think this accelerates the EU's push to become energy independent through clean energy"".The war in Ukraine has had a profound impact in pushing up global energy prices. They've been the biggest contributor to soaring inflation in the UK, Eurozone and US, something which is threatening to reduce global economic growth.The increasing cost of living has made political leaders around the world re-evaluate where they get their energy from, according to Ms Granholm, who was speaking from the International Atomic Energy Agency's Ministerial Conference in Vienna.""Every country is looking at the risks associated with putting too many eggs in one basket or putting too many eggs in the basket of petro-dictators and the volatility of the fossil fuels that accrue from that. Everyone is looking to how they can become energy independent.""Wind, solar and nuclear energy are among the alternatives many countries are trying to increase as they also aim to meet the Paris climate change targets.However an analysis by Columbia University suggests that Russia has a 46% share of global enrichment capacity for nuclear fuel, and the International Energy Agency warned in July that China has an 80% share ""in all the key manufacturing stages of solar panels"".When asked how the US and others don't end up overly reliant on such alternatives Ms Granholm replied that ""this move to clean energy could be part of a great peace plan"" and that such a move ""helps people's pocketbooks, helps the economy, and helps energy security"".This year's steep increases in the price of oil and gas have benefitted the energy giants who get them to consumers. In the first half of this year the combined profit of five of the biggest western energy firms, BP, Shell, Total, Chevron and Exxon almost tripled to just over $95.2bn with much of it going to shareholders.Ms Granholm said President Biden's administration wanted to see such companies lower prices at petrol pumps ""so that citizens are not hurting"".Despite acknowledging that oil is traded on a free market she called on them to help, ""at least the American companies as good American citizens"" and warned they could face a windfall tax similar to what has been seen in the UK.""We don't want that huge amount of profit to end up triggering consequences, either Congressionally or elsewhere, that will not be in their interest.""We want them to be responsible and not be buying back shares instead of increasing production, production that would ultimately reduce prices because of increasing supply. We are looking at legislative tools as well as otherwise pressuring them.""One other way the US could help increase the supply of oil to global markets is by lifting some of the sanctions imposed on Venezuela by President Trump.The South American country has the world's largest oil reserves but has been exporting minimal amounts of oil because of the restrictions. They were enacted because of alleged corruption and the political fallout from 2019's contested election. An increase in supplies would be likely to push down global oil prices. When asked if it was time to lift the sanctions, Ms Granholm didn't dismiss the idea, replying: ""I'm not going to get ahead of the White House on that.""You can watch Jennifer Granholm's interview in full on Talking Business with Aaron Heslehurst this weekend.Viewers in the UK can watch the show at 15:30 on the BBC News Channel, and afterwards on BBC iPlayer.In other countries, it will be on BBC World News on Saturday at 23:30 GMT, Sunday at 05:30 and 16:30 GMT and Monday at 16:30 GMT.",By Jonathan Josephs,US suggests Russia could be behind Nord Stream gas leaks
11,"A US army major doctor and her wife, a civilian doctor, have been charged with a plot to leak information to the Russian government. Jamie Lee Henry and Anna Gabrielian are accused of planning to share confidential information about patients at a military hospital. The pair allegedly told an undercover FBI agent that they were motivated by patriotism for Russia. Representatives of the couple have not yet commented on the case.There has been no comment from Russian authorities, either. The pair were charged with conspiracy and the disclosure of identifiable health information, in an indictment filed in a court in Baltimore, Maryland which was unsealed on Thursday after their arrest. Prosecutors said the couple wanted to help the Russian government ""gain insights into the medical conditions of individuals associated with the US government and military"".The indictment states that Maj Henry, 39, planned to use her security clearance to gain access to private medical records from the hospital at Fort Bragg, the large military base where she worked. Dr Gabrielian, 36, is accused of planning to share information from where she worked, believed to be Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. She allegedly offered help to the Russian embassy in Washington several months ago, after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In mid-August she was approached by a person claiming to work for the Russian embassy, who was in reality an FBI agent. During the meeting, the indictment says she told the agent that ""she was motivated by patriotism toward Russia to provide any assistance she could to Russia, even if it meant being fired or going to jail"".She is accused of offering to bring her wife into the plot, and telling the agent that she had access to medical information at the base and insight on how the US was training the military to provide assistance to Ukraine. At another meeting later on the same day, Maj Henry allegedly told the agent that she was also committed to Russia, and considered volunteering to join the Russian army. She apparently said she had reservations about violating the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which is what the couple have been charged with. But Dr Gabrielian allegedly had no such concerns, and handed over some information later in August. The indictment suggests the couple planned to hand over the medical records in order to prove their willingness to help the Russians, and their level of access to secret information. Dr Gabrielian is also accused of telling the agent that her wife could share information about how the US military establishes army hospitals in war conditions, and previous training given by the US to the Ukrainian military.

12,"An outbreak of Ebola in Uganda is proving more difficult to deal with than more recent epidemics, but the president has rejected calls for a lockdown.So far 31 cases have been confirmed, though it is feared that there could be many more.It is a deadly virus with initial symptoms which can include a sudden fever, intense weakness, muscle pain and a sore throat.Subsequent stages can include vomiting, diarrhoea and - in some cases - both internal and external bleeding, known as haemorrhaging. The incubation period can last from two days to three weeks. Ebola can be associated with other illnesses such as malaria and typhoid.The fact that it was three weeks before the first case was detected on 20 September has caused concern.Ebola spreads between humans by direct contact with bodily fluids and contaminated environments. Funerals can be a particular risk if mourners have direct contact with the body.Most of the 31 cases identified are in Uganda's central district of Mubende, of whom six people have died.However, the death toll may be higher. The health ministry says there were 18 deaths, linked to confirmed cases, where burials took place before they could be tested.The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates the fatality rate is between 41% and 100%.Another concern is that this is the Sudan strain of Ebola, for which there is no approved vaccine, unlike the more common Zaire strain. This means there has been no vaccination of health workers, who account for six of the confirmed cases.The Zaire strain was responsible for the largest ever outbreak of Ebola, in West Africa from December 2013 to 2016. More than 11,000 people died.With more than 28,000 cases in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, scientists carried out intensive research into Ebola vaccines.Two years after that epidemic ended, the then unlicensed Ervebo vaccine, developed by Merck, was used during an outbreak of the Zaire strain in the west of the Democratic Republic of Congo. It was granted clearance by the WHO, which said it had limited infections and saved lives.A second vaccine by Johnson & Johnson has since been approved for use by the European Medicines Agency. But neither of these vaccines has been tested against the Sudan strain.Nonetheless Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni said his government was exploring whether it was worth trying them.The focus is on contact tracing - finding those who have been in close proximity with patients, especially those who attended the community funerals.A 51-bed treatment facility is operational in Mubende district, the epicentre of the outbreak. A second facility is due to be set up soon.President Museveni said two mobile laboratories would be sent to Mubende by Friday, so that people would not have to travel for tests and risk spreading the virus.Medics have expressed concern about the lack of adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves and masks. They have also called for the affected region to be put under quarantine. However, President Museveni ruled out restrictions, saying: ""Ebola is not spread like corona[virus]"" as it is not an airborne disease.He said markets, schools and places of worship would remain open, but urged people to observe personal hygiene and avoid close contact. Ebola jumps to humans from infected animals, such as chimpanzees, fruit bats and forest antelope. Bushmeat - wild forest animals hunted for human consumption - is thought to be the natural reservoir of the virus.It then spreads between humans by direct contact with contaminated bodily fluids - blood, saliva, vomit, semen, vaginal discharge, urine, faeces and sweat.Men who have recovered from Ebola have also been found to harbour the virus in their semen for a period after recovery. To prevent infection, health professionals advise avoiding contact with cases, including stopping shaking hands, washing hands with soap and water and cleaning surfaces with chlorinated water.It is also important to isolate cases and their contacts. Countries usually set up holding centres for suspected cases and treatment centres for laboratory-confirmed cases.In eastern DR Congo, which borders Uganda, survivors of Ebola played a key role in providing care for infected patients as it has been established that they cannot be re-infected. However, medical teams must wear full PPE when attending to cases to prevent infection. Bodies, in a body bag, must be buried by those wearing proper PPE. More recent innovations have included having body bags with clear covers around the face to enable families to view the body safely before burial.

13," In recent years Canada has worked to advance reconciliation with indigenous people in the country. What does the accession of a new King of Canada mean for that process? Earlier this year, at a reception in Canada's national capital, King Charles - at the time the Prince of Wales - was asked for an apology. The request came from Assembly of First Nations National Chief RoseAnne Archibald, who told him that the Crown needs to make amends for the ""assimilation and genocide"" of indigenous schoolchildren at residential schools run by the Anglican Church - of which Charles is now the head - and for its role in colonisation. The three-day visit was Charles's nineteenth official tour in the country, and his last as the Prince of Wales.Charles did not apologise on the trip, though he spoke of the need to ""come to terms with the darker and more difficult aspects"" of history.But some are hopeful that the new King's accession will be the beginning of a more positive relationship between the Crown and indigenous peoples in Canada.Around the world, Commonwealth nations, including Canada, are grappling with what the role of the monarchy following Queen Elizabeth's death, and what her son, Charles, should do to make amends for colonialism.  In Canada, the King's accession comes amid a national conversation about reconciliation with indigenous peoples. It is a conversation that has been building for years, but came to the forefront last summer as First Nations came forward with evidence of the discovery of unmarked graves on the sites of former residential schools - government-funded institutions established in the 1800s that were part of a former policy to assimilate indigenous children.For Canada, reconciliation is multi-faceted. In addition to a royal apology, many have called on the Crown to return indigenous artefacts that were removed and taken to Britain, and to play a more active role in honouring historic treaty relationships between the monarchy and indigenous people.These treaties are constitutionally recognised agreements that define the rights and responsibilities between indigenous groups and federal and provincial governments. Treaties with the Crown date back to the 1700s, and negotiating modern treaties is seen as an important part of reconciliation. Cree writer and former treaty negotiator Darrel J McLeod argued in Canada's Globe and Mail newspaper earlier this month that Queen Elizabeth failed to use the resources available to her to make amends for things done in the Crown's name - from issuing formal apology to the repatriation of indigenous artefacts.He said he hoped the King will ""have the insight and determination to accomplish what his mother wasn't able to and use whatever time that might remain for the Windsor dynasty's role in Canada to turn things around"". The child graves behind Canada's national reckoningWATCH: Canada 'Sixties Scoop' - Indigenous survivors map out their storiesCanada was a monarchy even before it was a country. Over 500 years ago, both French and British monarchs presided over colonies in Canada. The connection between the Crown and indigenous peoples dates back even further, to when Europeans first set foot on the continent.To this day, symbols of treaties signed in the 1800s with the Crown can be seen on the prairies. When they were signed, 'treaty medals', which acknowledged promises made by the Crown, were handed out. ""It had the Queen's image on one side, and that was given to every chief who signed the treaty,"" noted Doug Cuthand, a Canadian columnist and member of the Little Pine First Nation in the province of Saskatchewan. ""And every chief who signs a treaty was given a Union Jack, because Canada didn't have a flag at that time.""Although now it is the federal government, and not the Royal Family, that has the power to administer these agreements, the Crown still has a symbolic relationship with indigenous people. Union Jacks are still a common sight at First Nations gatherings across those provinces, signifying the importance of those agreements, said Mr Cuthand. Canada's Governor General Mary Simon is the representative of the Crown in Canada, one of 15 countries where the King continues to operate as head of state. An Inuk woman - and the first indigenous person in the role - she recalled how as a child in the far north, portraits of the Queen hung in many homes.""She was revered by communities, Inuit people in the Arctic,"" she told the BBC's Chief International Correspondent Lyse Doucet earlier this month.But there is anger directed at the monarchy as well. In Manitoba last year, statues of Queen Victoria and Queen Elizabeth were toppled during protests over the unmarked graves at residential school sites. There is a recognition by indigenous people of the damage that colonialism did to the First Nations, said Mr Cuthand, but also of the ties forged long ago.""It's a bit of a dichotomy, isn't it?"" he said. ""There's that sort of high-level relationship that exists, but then there was the implementation of the treaties and of the colonialism that followed.""Nathan Tidridge, vice-president of the Institute for the Study of the Crown in Canada, argues that when Canada became a country in 1867, it in many ways eclipsed that original relationship between monarchy and indigenous nations, placing political power and the treaties under the control of federal governments. Entrusted by the Crown to govern, they oversaw damaging policies like residential schooling.Still, many indigenous people in Canada say King Charles has an important role in reconciliation despite being limited to a symbolic role as head of state and expected to not meddle in Canadian political affairs.  ""All signs point to an engaged King who is more competent on indigenous issues"" than Queen Elizabeth was, said Niigaan Sinclair, professor of indigenous studies at the University of Manitoba. ""We need a monarch that's going to intervene when they see injustice taking place,"" he said - one that's ""going to care beyond just nice words.""""We need a monarch that's going to have the ear of the prime minister and say 'these are the treaties that you must adhere to because the Crown has signed onto them.'""King Charles recently reiterated to the governor general that he was committed to reconciliation, and Mr Tidridge sees the potential for work to be done through the Crown's representatives like Ms Simon and her counterparts in Canada's provinces. Although he did not apologise on his recent visit, Mr Tidridge thinks that one day the King could come to Canada for the apology requested by Chief Archibald.""You don't just come for a whistle-stop tour, and then issue an apology - this takes time,"" he said.""The Crown is this old institution that sweeps up over a millennia of history. He is someone that recognises and understands that history,"" Mr Tidridge said of the new King.""He could do things that I think that his mother couldn't do.""",By Jessica Murphy,King Charles: Will the monarchy move reconciliation forward in Canada?
14,"Before a vote has been cast in Brazil's forthcoming election, current President Jair Bolsonaro is sowing doubts about how secure the country's voting system is. While campaigning, he has said that the voting machines used across Brazil are open to fraud, with echoes of Donald Trump's rhetoric around the 2020 US presidential election.""The system is completely vulnerable,"" claims President Bolsonaro, without providing evidence. Voting is done electronically, as has been the case since 1996.Each candidate has a number, and on election day voters type the number of their chosen candidate into a voting machine at polling stations across the country. The votes are then counted by the machines, and the totals are sent electronically to a central office. Votes from across the country are tallied up and a final result is announced, usually within hours of polls closing. Each machine also prints out a paper copy of the totals for each candidate. When polls close they are displayed publicly at polling sites, and each machine's votes can be compared with the total recorded by the electoral court. This year, for the first time, these paper copies will be published online on the day of the vote.President Bolsonaro has said: ""We cannot have dubious elections in 2022. Public counting of votes is needed."" He's been making similar claims for years. After winning the 2018 presidential election in a run-off, he claimed voting fraud robbed him of an outright victory in the first round, which he won by a 17 point margin with 46% of the vote.Subsequent studies of the 2018 election didn't find any evidence of voting irregularities. Brazilians vote electronically, so there are no paper copies of individual ballots.This has been highlighted by President Bolsonaro as a security issue, and he has called for ""printable and auditable"" paper ballots to safeguard the electronic system.""It's impossible to audit elections in Brazil,"" President Bolsonaro declared in July during a meeting with ambassadors.He says it is ""easy to rig"" electronic voting machines by altering their source code, the internal commands within a machine's software.It's not true to say you can't audit the vote in Brazil. The machines can retrieve votes cast for an electronic recount.Such an audit took place in the 2014 presidential election, which concluded that there was no foul play.""There is no reasonable proof of fraud going on in the past, at least in big audits that have been done,"" says Prof Marcos Simplicio, who took part in the auditing of the 2014 election.The Supreme Electoral Court, the body that oversees Brazil's election, says the system has a series of procedures in place to secure the vote.For example, a number of voting machines are selected at random to be removed from polling sites for a test vote alongside the actual vote on election day.These are checked to be working correctly by entering test votes for each of the candidates in a process witnessed by party representatives. ""The vote placed in the electronic ballot box is secured by several mechanisms. The software goes through several tests, including tests with experts and outside investigators who try to break its security,"" says Julio Valente, the Information Technology Secretary of Brazil's electoral court.Before each election the court invites researchers and software experts to look for vulnerabilities in the voting system. This year, more than 20 experts tried to penetrate the system but failed to do so.However, over the years experts have said improvements could be made.""The security of the Brazilian election system relies heavily on the system's software, which has been the main point of criticism from the academic community since the 90s,"" says Prof Paulo Matias, a computer security specialist at the University of São Carlos. Brazil election: 'We'll vote for Bolsonaro because he is God'Lula: Can Brazil's 'most popular president' win again?Brazil election: Why it matters so much to the USPresident Bolsonaro has also claimed votes are counted in a ""secret room"" out of public view at the central electoral office. The votes are counted by computers that are located in a secure room but party representatives can monitor the process.""The view of most of the technical community is that fraud is really hard in the current system. The system can be improved and should be, but that doesn't mean there's been fraud,"" says Prof Simplicio.Allegations that the system is unreliable have spread across social media - often in groups backing the president. Just a quarter of Bolsonaro supporters say they trust the electoral system ""a lot"", and almost a third don't trust it ""at all"" according to a recent survey.Videos containing misleading information from previous elections are used to cast doubt on the system.  Two videos that were spread following the 2018 election showed voters entering Bolsonaro's number and receiving the message ""null vote"". However, on the election day, Brazilians don't vote only for the president. They also cast votes for other political representatives, such as senators and governors, and use unique numbers to do so. A closer look at the two videos shows that Bolsonaro's number had been pressed when the voter was asked to choose a  governor. When there is no candidate with that number, a ""null vote"" message is displayed. Voters can still correct the mistake and press the right number before confirming their vote.Another video allegedly showed a man pressing Bolsonaro's number and the machine showing his rival's picture instead. At the time, the electoral court debunked the video, saying it had been edited. The video didn't show the voting machine buttons and screen at the same time, which meant different images could've been stitched together.Additional reporting by Mariana SanchesRead more from Reality CheckSend us your questions",By Juliana Gragnani & Jake Horton,Brazil election: Do voting machines lead to fraud?
15,"Santiago Matela was 22 when he was dragged off the street by soldiers while playing basketball. The year was 1977, five years since President Ferdinand E Marcos had declared martial law in the Philippines -  on 21 September 1972.Mr Marcos suspended parliament and arrested opposition leaders - Mr Matela was among the tens of thousands of people detained and tortured during a decade of martial law.  Fifty years on, he is no longer afraid to speak out. But he is afraid of not being believed at a time when the truth about one of the darkest periods in Filipino history is under attack. Mr Matela endured three months of torture, including being tied naked to a block of ice. His captors demanded he admit to being a communist. He says he didn't even know what that word meant.""They kept on forcing me to confess that I was leading a rally and throwing grenades. They asked me the same questions again and again and beat me. They used a yantok - a cane - and they hit my body many times,"" he said. ""Even my genitals were assaulted by the military just to make you confess what you should not be confessing.""Some 70,000 people were imprisoned, 34,000 were tortured and over 3,200 people were killed in the nine years after Mr Marcos imposed martial law, according to Amnesty International.Meanwhile, the Marcos family lived famously opulent lifestyles. Mr Marcos' wife, Imelda Marcos, amassed a huge collection of art and other luxuries, including hundreds of pairs of shoes.They deny siphoning off billions of dollars of state wealth while at the helm of what historians consider one of Asia's most notorious kleptocracies. Public anger at abuse and corruption eventually led to pro-democracy protests in 1986 and the family were forced to flee to Hawaii where they lived in exile. Ferdinand Marcos died three years later.But earlier this year, his son and namesake, Ferdinand Marcos Jr - popularly known as ""Bongbong"" - led an extraordinary comeback and won the presidency in a landslide victory.What a Marcos revival means for the PhilippinesWhy the Marcos family is so infamous'Politicians hire me to spread fake stories'The Marcos rebranding is the result of a major social media operation, aimed at younger Filipinos born after martial law ended. The message seeded in snappy Facebook, YouTube and TikTok posts is that the family has been unfairly treated by the mainstream press.Mr Marcos Jr has shunned network news interviews and refused to participate in presidential debates. He has made it clear he doesn't want to discuss the past and has instead focused on a promise to unite the nation and help it recover from the crippling effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.This popular message, by a recognisable celebrity name, hit home with voters eager for change - including Mr Matela's children. Mr Matela tells me that his son believes the past should stay in the past, a view that he finds upsetting. ""My son is adamantly on their side. He doesn't know that what I'm doing is all for them. These are my experiences and what I'm fighting for is for their sake too, so that they will know what happened. ""You want me to just disregard what I went through? That cannot happen. The sufferings I went through are embedded in my mind,"" he said. ""I'm still fighting because of my pain.""The Marcos administration insists it has not engaged in disinformation. Gemma, a fact checker from the news website Rappler founded by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Maria Ressa, says the disinformation being propagated is difficult to quantify.""It's not one single page, it's not one single account, it's not one single group. The point is that it's coming at you from various points. We've mapped tens of thousands of accounts and groups and pages. ""Many look like official history pages and post content that triggers nostalgia but within that content you will find stories peddling an incorrect narrative.""Among the most widely spread falsehoods are claims that no arrests were made under martial law.""Many of the posts deny human rights abuses took place and claim that the only people incarcerated were rebels or criminals or troublemakers,"" Gemma said. The Marcos administration has not responded to the BBC's requests for an interview. Mr Marcos Jr has posted an interview on YouTube with his goddaughter where he denies that his father was a dictator.The Marcos family has never apologised, but more than 11,000 victims, including Mr Matela, have received reparations from the government.Their written accounts are logged in dozens of numbered cardboard boxes piled high in an archive at the Human Rights Violations Victims' Memorial Commission, an independent government body.In a new green room at the centre, a young team are creating their own snappy social media posts - with facts about martial law.""You have to go where the young people are,"" says executive director Crisanto Carmelo. Fears the past is being rewritten have led to a push to preserve and digitise the detailed accounts of martial law abuse in the hope that they can be placed in a museum. One file recalls how a mother was handed back the body of her brutally tortured and murdered son. The account is too gruesome to detail here.But will Mr Marcos allow such a museum - one built to honour the victims of martial law - while he is president?""I am optimistic that he will be magnanimous in victory and serious in his intention to unify the country,"" Mr Carmelo said. ""This is the year which marks the 50th year of the declaration of martial law which transformed our country and transformed the lives of many ordinary Filipinos. Many of them are now in their senior years, like me, so a museum is not for me, I lived through it. ""A museum is for the younger generation - to say that this happened to our country and if we can come together, they can determine what type of country and system of government and rules of liberty and democracy they want for the future.""Many young Filipinos are engaged. On a recent popular historical tour, young Filipinos played games to recreate the past.The idea is to help them pin down the facts and navigate away from a maze of martial law myths.The teams took selfies together - most of them had met only a few hours earlier. They planted flowers at the memorial with the names of those who died under martial law.Seventeen-year-old Hannah found the day emotional.""They've lost their dreams, their lives and I wanted to recognise that. I want to go and tell my friends that in order for us to have the liberty and democracy we have today, these were people who sacrificed everything. They suffered a lot of violence and immoral wrongdoings, and they deserve to be recognised.""It seems that voices from the past, however painful, are helping to keep this country's collective memory alive.",By Laura Bicker,Keeping alive the memory of a decade of torture
16,"When Coolio first heard the demo that became Gangsta's Paradise, he had the same reaction as the rest of us.""I was like, 'Damn, I really like this song.'""The Pennsylvania-born, Compton-raised rapper was at his manager's house in 1995 to pick up a cheque, when he noticed producer Doug Rasheed messing around with the song in another room.""So I went to Doug said, 'Yo! What's this?'"" ""He said, 'It's just a song we're working on', ""And immediately I said, 'It's mine'. Just like that. ""I freestyled the whole first line, then I sat down, I picked up a pen and I started to write."" Released in August 1995, and boosted by a memorable video starring Michelle Pfeiffer, the song immediately ruled the airwaves. Those lurching stings, the other-worldly choir, and that soaring hook, combined with Coolio's distinctive, confessional storytelling, made it an instant classic.It was the first ""serious"" rap song to top the UK and US charts, opening the door for acts like 2Pac and the Notorious B.I.G, who, until that point, had been considered too abrasive for the mainstream. And its appeal has never lessened. The biggest-selling single of 1995 in America, Gangsta's Paradise has now been streamed more than one billion times on both Spotify and YouTube. ""I thought it was going to be a hood record,"" he told The Voice in 2017. ""I never thought it would crossover the way that it did - to all ages, races, genres, countries and generations.""And yet... Gangsta's Paradise faced several hurdles on its way to the top. Here's how it unfolded...Pfeiffer and Snoop lead tributes to rapper Coolio 'People thought Coolio in Castlederg was a hoax'Coolio was born Artis Leon Ivey, Jr in Pennsylvania, and moved to Compton in South Central LA as a boy. Suffering from chronic asthma, he became a bookworm and excelled at school.""I lived in that library, man,"" he told Rolling Stone, while visiting his old neighbourhood in 1995. ""I read every kid's book they had in there. I even read Judy Blume.""That changed when he turned 11 and his parents divorced. Seeking a way to fit in, he fell into the gangster lifestyle and adopted a menacing, street-tough persona. A few years later, he was busted for bringing a weapon into school. Before he turned 20, he had served time behind bars for larceny.Later, Coolio studied at Compton Community College and discovered rap. He took his stage name, Coolio Iglesias, from Latin heartthrob from Julio Iglesias, and released a few singles on the local scene, but drug abuse derailed his career.In his 20s he moved to San Jose to live with his father, while working as a firefighter; and later credited Christianity for helping him overcome his addiction to crack.Still enamoured with rap, he made a guest appearance on WC and the Maad Circle's 1991 debut album, Ain't a Damn Thang Changed; then joined a collective called the 40 Thevz before signing a solo deal with Tommy Boy records - the influential label that played home to De La Soul, Naughty By Nature and House Of Pain.His first album, It Takes a Thief, arrived in 1994, and was praised for its combination of funky grooves and socially-conscious lyrics. The musician's message was exemplified by the ""hilarious"" video for Fantastic Voyage, said Source magazine.""As the Lakeside groove carries you along, Coolio piles about six milion people into the trunk of his '64 and takes them to a magical land where race, poverty, gangs and sexual orientation don't matter and everybody was cool.""Hip-hop's gatekeepers were not interested in such idealism. Ivey's anti-violence, pro-acceptance stance somehow made him ""soft"". He earned the unwelcome nickname ""Un-Coolio"".But then came Gangsta's Paradise.One day, Doug Rasheed pulled out his copy of Stevie Wonder's 1976 double-album Songs In The Key Of Life and cut a sample from Pastime Paradise, a bleak and anxious track that was one of the first songs to replace an orchestra with synthesized strings.Rasheed added a crunching beat and a menacing synth bass, then took the track to singer Larry ""LV"" Sanders, who laid down a vocal for the chorus.""I came in singing 'Pastime Paradise,' but then I changed it up to 'Gangsta's Paradise,'"" he told Rolling Stone for an oral history of the song in 2015. ""I did my parts, all the vocals and the chorus, and I did the choir. That whole choir that you hear was actually me - I did all the parts from soprano down to tenor to the bass.""LV wanted a rapper to appear on the track, and offered it to his friend Prodeje, who declined. Then Coolio overheard it.Mesmerised, he started writing lyrics straight away. The opening lyric, which riffs on Psalm 23, came to him instantly: ""As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death/I take a look at my life and realise there's not much left.""""I freestyled the whole first line, then I sat down, I picked up a pen and I started to write,"" he told the YouTube series Hot Ones in 2016.""It was divine intervention. I was an instrument and the song was the entity. It wrote itself.""Coolio was 30 at the time the song was written, but the narrator is 23 and he doesn't know if he'll live to see 24. He was ""raised by the street"", immersed a life of crime and retribution. If anyone crosses him, they'll end up ""lined in chalk"". But the story never glorifies the gangster lifestyle. The narrator prays every night, aware that he's trapped. In the final verse, he accuses the system of letting him down.""They say I gotta learn, but nobody's here to teach me / If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?""It's a bleak story. One that could only have been told with the perspective Coolio gained from his teenage years. And the rapper bristled when his song was lumped in with the so-called ""gangster rap"" scene.""I'm trying to get rid of that jacket that's been put on my back - that I'm a gangsta rapper,"" he said in 1995. ""That's not my thing.""My thing is to be true to myself and try to educate and entertain kids. When I make references [to the gangster lifestyle], I'm trying to get kids' attention using language they want to hear.""Then I can take them to a deeper level. I'm just trying to get a better understanding of myself and a better understanding of other people.""Gangsta's Paradise was a stark departure from the feel-good funk of Coolio's first album and, at first, his record label weren't sure what to make of it. ""I called my A&R at Tommy Boy Records, and I played it for him. He said, 'It sounds pretty good - I think it would make a good album cut.' Those were his exact words!""Incensed, the star's manager decided to shop the song around to movie studios. It nearly ended up on the soundtrack to the Will Smith film Bad Boys, but was eventually placed in the Disney movie Dangerous Minds - the true story of a former Marine who turns around a troubled inner-city high school by teaching them poetry and Bob Dylan lyrics.A lukewarm retread of Dead Poets Society, it was allegedly testing badly with audiences until Coolio's song started getting played on MTV. The video, like the film, starred Michelle Pfeiffer, who went face-to-face with Coolio as a camera spun around them.""She was real nice,"" Coolio told Kiss FM's Rap show at the time. ""She brought her son down to the shoot with her and she was cool. We had no problems.""He was less enamoured with the movie itself, though.""I hate those kinds of movies where, you know, the great white hope comes into the inner-city neighbourhood and saves the little children - 'Ooh la la, hey Santa Claus!' or whatever, all those kinds of things put it in play,"" he told Yahoo two years ago. ""Those kinds of moments happen very few and far between. It's not that many people that care about each other [in real life].""According to Rolling Stone's oral history, the producers of Dangerous Minds, Coolio was paid $100,000 (£92,000) for Gangsta's Paradise. There was only one problem: Stevie Wonder hadn't cleared the sample.""When Stevie heard it, he was like, ""No, no way. I'm not letting my song be used in some gangster song,'"" the star recalled. Luckily, Coolio's then-wife Josefa Salinas, knew Wonder's brother. ""I guess he had been trying to tap that for years,"" he joked in the Rolling Stone article. ""She made a call to him, got a meeting with Stevie and talked him into it. His only stipulation was that I had to take the curse words out.""That edit undoubtedly changed Coolio's life. A profane version of Gangsta's Paradise would never have been played on pop radio, or entered heavy rotation on MTV. When it hit number one, it opened up new possibilities for hip-hop... although, to some, it marked the end of an era.""America suddenly realised it could sell non-party rap to Brit panty-waists, and that's exactly what it's done ever since,"" wrote music journalist Garry Mulholland in his book This Is Uncool: The 500 Greatest Singles Since Punk And Disco.""In many ways, Gangsta's Paradise signalled the end of gangsta, or 'reality' rap as a cult. It lost the allure of the forbidden when you mum started singing along.""Coolio was ambivalent about the song too, often lamenting how its success overshadowed his other work.""It's a blessing and a curse at the same time,"" he said. ""For people that really like Gangsta's Paradise, that's all they really want to hear.""In recent years, however, the musician came to appreciate the song's legacy, and his role in hip-hop history.""People would kill to take my place,"" he said in 2018.

17,"Last week, Australian telecommunications giant Optus revealed about 10 million customers - about 40% of the population - had personal data stolen in what it calls a cyber-attack.Some experts say it may be the worst data breach in Australia's history.But this week has seen more dramatic and messy developments - including ransom threats, tense public exchanges and scrutiny over whether this constituted a ""hack"" at all.It's also ignited critical questions about how Australia handles data and privacy.Optus - a subsidiary of Singapore Telecommunications Ltd - went public with the breach about 24 hours after it noticed suspicious activity on its network.Australia's second-largest telecoms provider said current and former customers' data was stolen - including names, birthdates, home addresses, phone and email contacts, and passport and driving licence numbers. It stressed that payment details and account passwords were not compromised.Those whose passport or licence numbers were taken - roughly 2.8 million people - are at a ""quite significant"" risk of identity theft and fraud, the government has since said.Optus said it was investigating the breach and had notified police, financial institutions, and government regulators. The breach appears to have originated overseas, local media reported. In an emotional apology, Optus chief executive Kelly Bayer Rosmarin called it a ""sophisticated attack"", saying the company has very strong cybersecurity.""Obviously, I am angry that there are people out there that want to do this to our customers, and I'm disappointed that we couldn't have prevented it,"" she said on Friday. Early on Saturday, an internet user published data samples on an online forum and demanded a ransom of $1m (A$1.5m; £938,000) in cryptocurrency from Optus.The company had a week to pay or the other stolen data would be sold off in batches, the person said.Investigators are yet to verify the user's claims, but some experts quickly said the sample data - which contained about 100 records - appeared legitimate.Sydney-based tech reporter Jeremy Kirk contacted the purported hacker and said the person gave him a detailed explanation of how they stole the data.The user contradicted Optus's claims the breach was ""sophisticated"", saying they pulled the data from a freely accessible software interface.""No authenticate needed… All open to internet for any one to use,"" they said in a message, according to Kirk.In another escalation on Tuesday, the person claiming to be the hacker released 10,000 customer records and reiterated the ransom deadline.But just hours later, the user apologised - saying it had been a ""mistake"" - and deleted the previously posted data sets.""Too many eyes. We will not sale [sic] data to anyone,"" they posted. ""Deepest apology to Optus for this. Hope all goes well from this.""That sparked speculation about whether Optus had paid the ransom - which the company denies - or whether the user had been spooked by the police investigation.Adding to the problem, others on the forum had copied the now-deleted data sets, and continued to distribute them.It also emerged some customers' Medicare details - government identification numbers that could provide access to medical records - had also been stolen, something Optus did not previously disclose. Late on Wednesday, the company said this had affected almost 37,000 Medicare cards.  Optus has been inundated with messages from angry customers since last week. People have been warned to watch out for signs of identity theft and for opportunistic scammers, who are said to be already cashing in on the confusion. A class-action lawsuit could soon be filed against the company. ""This is potentially the most serious privacy breach in Australian history, both in terms of the number of affected people and the nature of the information disclosed,"" said Ben Zocco from Slater and Gordon Lawyers.The government has called the breach ""unprecedented"" and blamed Optus, saying it ""effectively left the window open"" for sensitive data to be stolen.In an ABC television interview on Monday, Cyber Security Minister Clare O'Neil was asked: ""You certainly don't seem to be buying the line from Optus that this was a sophisticated attack?""""Well, it wasn't. So no,"" Ms O'Neil replied. The moment drew lots of attention online.

So it is not the case of having some sort of completely exposed APIs [software interfaces] sitting out there.""I think most customers understand that we are not the villains,"" she said, adding Optus could not say more while the investigation was ongoing.The company has faced calls to cover the costs of replacement passport and driving licences, as people scramble to protect themselves.The breach highlights how much Australia lags behind other parts of the world on privacy and cyber issues, Ms O'Neil says.""We are probably a decade behind… where we ought to be,"" she told the ABC.Australia probes firms over customer 'faceprints' Australia's Nine TV network hit by cyber-attackBoth sides of politics have traded blame on the issue. Opposition MPs have said the Labor government is ""asleep at the wheel"", but the government points out it was only elected in May after a decade of conservative rule.Ms O'Neil pointed to two areas needing urgent reform.She argues the government should be able to better penalise companies like Optus. In some countries, the company would have faced hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties but Australia's fine is capped at about $2m, she said.She also wants to expand cyber-security laws that were introduced last year to include telecommunications companies.""At the time, the telecommunications sector said: ""Don't worry about us - we're really good at cybersecurity. We'll do it without being regulated. I would say that this incident really calls that assertion into question.""Security experts have also suggested reforming data retention laws so telecommunication companies don't have to keep sensitive information for so long. Ex-customers should also have the right to request companies delete their data, experts say.Optus says it is required to keep identity data for six years under the current rules.Other industry figures have argued consumers should be able to take companies that lose control of their information to court, instead of the industry regulator.",By Tiffanie Turnbull,Optus: How a massive data breach has exposed Australia
18,"In the second of two profiles of the leading candidates in the race to become Brazil's new president, Katy Watson asks if Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is the same person who took the world by storm 20 years ago.It is no coincidence that Lula chose the Amazon as one of his key destinations on the campaign trail. The 76-year-old's main rival in the presidential election on 2 October, far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, has been accused of destroying the rainforest. Lula knows that climate issues have soared to the top of the political agenda and in Manaus, the biggest city in the Amazon, he told reporters ""the planet needs special attention from all of us"".""We need to look after our forest, our fauna, our water, but most of all, we need to look after our people because they're struggling, they're in need and they need to live with dignity,"" he said. ""We can reclaim this country, it's possible to once again walk with our heads held high.""Lula chose the Museum of the Amazon to meet indigenous leaders and talk about the future of the forest. ""Nobody wants to turn the Amazon into an untouchable world sanctuary,"" he told the audience. ""What we want is to benefit from our wealth, our biodiversity."" By saying that, the former president shows that he is aware of his rival's message. President Bolsonaro is at great pains to say that the rest of the world needs to stop meddling in Brazil's affairs.It is 20 years since Lula won the presidency for the first time. A former metal worker and union leader, he became a familiar face during the strikes of the 1970s, when workers called for higher wages, defying Brazil's military rulers.He came to power promising change. Helped by high commodity prices, he spent the windfalls on areas such as higher education and welfare programmes that contributed to lifting millions of Brazilians out of poverty. Described by former US President Barack Obama as ""the most popular politician on Earth"", Lula left office after eight years in power with an approval rating of more than 80%.Like him or hate him, he was a politician unlike any other. But in recent years, that legacy has been tainted with his party - and Lula himself - hit by corruption scandals. In 2017, he was sentenced to nine years in prison. His convictions were quashed four years later, but his brush with the law means that he is no longer just seen as the ""saviour"" of Brazil. Instead, many millions of Brazilians see him as a corrupt politician unfit for office.Given that split among voters, I asked him how he thought he could convince the electorate he is the right man to lead Brazil. ""Deaths [like that] of Dom Phillips and Bruno Pereira can't ever happen again,"" he said, skirting the question with a reference to the killing in June of a British journalist and an indigenous expert in the Amazon.""Brazil needs to be transformed into a civilised country, it can't fall victim to inhumane people,"" he added. ""I am convinced that we need to change Brazil - and changing Brazil means having a government that assumes responsibility for really caring for people.""Not far from the centre of Manaus, where Lula spoke, 24-year-old mother-of-three Carol Araújo lives in small community of palafitas - houses that sit on stilts over a small river.Rainy season is coming to an end and the earth below the houses here in the neighbourhood of São Jorge resembles a swamp more than a river.Rubbish is everywhere: broken bottles, old boxes and shoes. In the sweltering heat of Manaus, the stench is overpowering.  Official figures suggest an estimated 63 million people now live in poverty in Brazil, and Carol, who was born in São Jorge, is one of them. She knows nothing but hardship, but she does know who she is going to cast her ballot for. ""I'm going to vote for Lula because under him, everything was easier,"" she says. ""But I don't know if [by him] coming back things will improve."" It is a risk she is prepared to take. With food and energy prices rising, she cannot make ends meet.""I try and find work when it comes my way but it's hard. I have to make it work to feed my children."" She says that it comes down to knowing who will help her and those like her, because ""during the elections, all the politicians do is make promises"".Lula more easily relies on the older generation, which can remember the good times, but he knows he will have to win over the younger generation voting for the first time. ""It's a sign of the incapacity of Brazil's elite to renew itself,"" says Oliver Stuenkel, professor of international relations at the Getúlio Vargas Foundation in São Paulo. ""Lula has been running for president since Brazil became a democracy in the late 1980s, and in that sense he is very much a key personality of Brazil's transition from autocracy to democracy. But he struggles to point to the future, he's very much a throwback.""But while this is the same Lula, he will not be in charge of the same Brazil. Economic crises and more political polarisation set the country apart from what he inherited the first time.For supporter Beth Ferreira, that does not matter. ""I am crazy about Lula - Brazil needs him because we are in decline,"" she says. ""When he started in 2003, Brazil was in the same situation, it was devastated. And we think he can do the same thing - our hope never dies.""",By Katy Watson,Lula: Can Brazil's 'most popular president' win again?
