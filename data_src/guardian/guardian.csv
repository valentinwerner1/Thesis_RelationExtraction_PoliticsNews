0,"The family of a British citizen who was allegedly taken to Nigeria in an act of extraordinary rendition has been granted a court hearing to challenge the UK government for not intervening in his case.Nnamdi Kanu, the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (Ipob), a prominent separatist movement proscribed in Nigeria, was arrested in Kenya in June last year before being transported against his will to Nigeria, where he has been held ever since.In July, the UN working group on arbitrary detention published an opinion that the father of two had been subject to extraordinary rendition and said he should be released immediately. However, successive UK foreign secretaries, first Dominic Raab and then Liz Truss, before she became prime minister, have refused to take a view as to whether Kanu was a victim of extraordinary rendition.The family has been granted a judicial review to challenge that refusal, arguing that its effect has been that no action has been taken to help him.His brother, Kingsley Kanu, said: “The British government is well known for its stance on human rights. I believe it must be decisive when it comes to its decision-making about very serious violations of the human rights of British citizens abroad, especially when the facts are clear, as they are in my brother’s case, and when the UN has investigated and reached a firm conclusion that my brother was subject to extraordinary rendition. I am very happy that the court has agreed that a hearing is necessary to decide this important issue.”Kanu’s family claim he was tortured in Kenya and has been held in solitary confinement in Abuja since being transported there. The UN working group referred the case to the special rapporteur on torture. It expressed concern that he had been denied treatment and medication for his heart condition and highlighted that solitary confinement in excess of 15 consecutive days is prohibited under the Nelson Mandela rules, international non-binding standards.In a court filing concerning a parallel case brought by Nnamdi Kanu in Abuja, the Nigerian government denied torturing or mistreating him. It claimed that he entered Kenya unlawfully, having previously jumped bail in Nigeria, and so had no right to an extradition hearing.In 2015, Kanu was arrested in Nigeria and charged with terrorism offences and incitement, after setting up a digital radio station, Radio Biafra, at his home in London. Two years later he fled the country while on bail after an attack on his family home, which he claimed killed 28 members of Ipob. In January, he pleaded not guilty to terrorism charges.Shirin Marker, from Bindmans LLP, who is representing Kingsley Kanu, said it was essential for the new foreign secretary, James Cleverly, to reach a firm conclusion on whether her client’s brother had been the victim of extraordinary rendition in order to decide what steps to take to assist him.“The evidence available to date establishes that he has been subject to extraordinary rendition and torture or inhumane treatment,” she said. “It is unacceptable for the UK government to continue to prevaricate on this issue. We are glad that the court has now granted permission for this case to move to a final hearing.”Explaining her decision to grant a judicial review hearing, Mrs Justice Ellenbogen said: “Such decisions/inaction are, in principle, reviewable and do not enter forbidden areas, including decisions affecting foreign policy.”The Foreign Office declined to comment while proceedings were active.",[{'name': 'Haroon Siddique Legal affairs correspondent'}],UK government faces court challenge in Nigerian rendition case
1,"The Egyptian hosts of the next UN climate summit have issued a plea for countries to set aside tensions and animosity over the Ukraine war for the sake of focusing on the climate crisis.Egypt will host the Cop27 conference in Sharm El-Sheikh in November, intended as a forum for companies to fulfil the promises they made at the landmark Cop26 summit in Glasgow last year.However, expectations for the meeting have dimmed, as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has set nations at loggerheads, while the rocketing energy prices and food prices that have resulted have wrought economic and political damage across the developed and developing world.Climate journalism, open to allA diplomatic freeze between the US and China – the world’s two biggest emitters of greenhouse gases – over Taiwan has also cast a pall over the talks.Wael Aboulmagd, the Egyptian government’s special representative for Cop27, called on nations to concentrate on the pressing nature of the climate crisis and to carry on negotiations despite their differences on other geopolitical issues.“Animosity will have a cost. We as responsible diplomats ask everyone to rise to the occasion and show leadership,” he said during a call with journalists on Wednesday. “Put political differences aside and come together.”Climate negotiations are supposed to carry on in their own diplomatic stream, regardless of external events, and the three decades of talks under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change have weathered wars and regional conflicts before. In June, at a preparatory UN climate meeting in Bonn, some countries staged a walkout when Russia took to the conference floor but returned to negotiations later.Aboulmagd said countries must not use the upheavals in geopolitics and in national economies since Cop26 to hide their inaction. “Show more ambition,” he said. “I urge everyone not to use this unfolding geopolitical situation as a pretext for backsliding.”Rather, rising fossil fuel prices should concentrate minds on finding alternatives, he said. “I hope and urge everyone to take the right lesson from this: that overdependence on fossil fuels is problematic, and we need to expedite the transition to renewable energy.”He pointed out that no country would escape damage from the climate crisis, and that all countries agreed at Glasgow on the vital importance of working together to bring down greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the impacts of extreme weather. “Set aside the adversarial zero sum approach. With this most existential threat, we need to act to save lives and livelihoods. There is no time for delays, no pretext for not acting or backtracking.”Aboulmagd, who was Egypt’s ambassador to Brazil and is now assisting Sameh Shoukry, the foreign minister who will act as president of Cop27, also promised that civil society would be represented at the talks.Sign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

We are involving civil society stakeholders across the board and every step of the way,” he said.He said the Egyptian government had moved to recognise an increasing number of groups active in climate campaigning and would devote several days of the fortnight-long conference to issues such as youth engagement, under-represented groups, climate finance and related issues such as water and nature.However, many campaigners have told the Guardian of difficulties obtaining visas and passes to the conference, and prohibitively high prices for accommodation. They are also worried about their ability to protest, and whether groups and individuals they work with in Egypt may face reprisals after the summit.",[{'name': 'Fiona Harvey Environment correspondent'}],Cop27: Egyptian hosts urge leaders to set aside tensions over Ukraine
2,"It would be cynical to see Saudi Arabia’s efforts to secure the release of international prisoners held by Russian proxies in Ukraine as an attempt to improve the country’s image after the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, its foreign minister has said.Prince Faisal bin Farhan al Saud said on Friday that Riyadh had first approached the UK government in April, shortly after Aiden Aslin, a British citizen, and others were captured at Mariupol, and had acted for compassionate reasons, hoping to negotiate their release.Asked if it was a rare opportunity to repair relations with the west, the minister said: “I think that’s a very cynical view. What we saw, what the kingdom’s leadership saw, was an opportunity to achieve a humanitarian breakthrough to facilitate the return of these detainees to their families. And that’s the motivation.”Saudi Arabia, which has sought to take a softer stance on Russia following the outbreak of the war, has previously said Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was involved in a major diplomatic effort, which also appeared to have involved the former Chelsea football club owner and billionaire Roman Abramovich.One of the five Britons released, Shaun Pinner, recognised Abramovich on the plane flying them out from Russia to Riyadh earlier this week and approached him to ask if he was the former football club owner, according to a report in the Sun.Another of those released, John Harding, recounted the exchange that followed between the two men. “He went over to him on the plane and asked where he was from and Roman said ‘London’.“Then Shaun said, ‘You really look like Roman Abramovich’ and he replied, ‘That’s because I am him, sir’. He couldn’t believe it.”Five Britons were among 10 people facing the death penalty from pro-Russia separatists who were released unexpectedly earlier this week. They had all been accused of fighting as mercenaries on behalf of Ukraine, and had been put on trial in breach of the Geneva conventions covering prisoners of war.Aiden Aslin, 28, returned to his family home near Newark on Thursday, as did the other Britons, including Pinner, with whom he was put on trial in June. Aslin, Pinner and the Moroccan Brahim Saadoun, also released this week, had been sentenced to death in a ruling condemned internationally.Abramovich has not confirmed the reports but the billionaire, who was forced to sell Chelsea after Russia invaded Ukraine, had appeared at unsuccessful peace talks between the two sides in Istanbul in March. He is not on the US sanctions list, partly because Ukraine has told Washington he acts as a mediator.Prince Faisal said the mediation was “an initiative” led by Bin Salman dating back to April. “We learned about the issue of these foreign detainees and he engaged with the UK and others and of course, with Russia and Ukraine, to work towards the end of getting them out,” the foreign minister added.The Saudi minister said the deal to exchange the 10 foreign nationals was linked to a separate, larger deal to exchange prisoners between Ukraine and Russia. “That exchange only happened when the 10 nationals arrived in Saudi territory and were verified and that allowed the other exchange to go ahead,” Prince Faisal said.That implied Ukraine had wanted Russia to show good faith before it released the pro-Russian oligarch Viktor Medvedchuk and 55 other prisoners, in return for 200 soldiers and five commanders of the Azov battalion who led the defence of Mariupol. That deal also involved mediation from Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.

3,"Doctors at the biggest hospital in Tigray say they have just days supply left of insulin, as the resumption of fighting between rebels and Ethiopian government troops once again cuts off supplies to the region.In what the head of the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) has branded “a humanitarian crime,” medics at Ayder specialist referral hospital warn they have already run out of one kind of the life-saving medicine and have only a week’s supply of another.Earlier this year, a cessation of hostilities in the bitter conflict between the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) and federal troops allowed for the delivery of emergency supplies into the northern region, which until then had been languishing under what the United Nations termed a de-facto blockade.Now, with fighting once again raging and both sides blaming the other for breaking the truce, humanitarian officials say they have been unable to get fresh supplies of either food or medicines into Tigray for a month. The region remains largely cut off from the rest of Ethiopia, without basic services such as electricity, communications and banking.“What we had at the hospital we were distributing to the patients, but especially this week, patients are coming and we tell them we don’t have insulin medications,” said a senior doctor, who did not want to be named for security reasons. “They are coming from very far places. Transport is not easy … So when they reach here and we tell them there is no insulin, they are heartbroken. They cry.”The doctor said he was scared that Ayder hospital would see a repeat of last year, when supplies into Tigray were stopped for months. “We will see patients dying and falling in the street,” he said.Andrew Boulton, president of the IDF and professor of medicine at the University of Manchester, called on Abiy Ahmed’s government to take urgent action so that insulin and other essential supplies could get to Tigray.“This is really a sort of humanitarian crime,” he said. “Even at times of war, there are agreements that essential medications should get through to the population. And this appears not to be occurring at the moment, in the best evidence that I have.”‘I saw an oncologist cry’: Tigray cancer patients sent home to die for lack of drugsRead moreA second doctor at Ayder hospital said doctors in Tigray generally used two types of insulin: fast-acting, or regular, insulin and an intermediate-acting insulin known as NPH.“What we have is a very [small] amount of the regular; we reserved that to manage acute complications of diabetes,” the doctor said. “Otherwise, the main insulin preparation for the patient is the intermediate-acting, which mimics physiologic insulin. We don’t have that one. It’s almost more than a month since we have finished the insulin.”People with type 1 diabetes require daily insulin to control their blood glucose levels. Without this, their condition can rapidly prove fatal.Boulton has written to the Ethiopian health minister, Lia Tadesse Gebremedhin, urging her to end the “ongoing regulatory and security obstacles” that are “endangering the lives of the many thousands of people living with chronic and non-communicable conditions, including diabetes”.More than 6,000 people were being treated for type 1 diabetes throughout the region before the war began, about 2,500 of them at Ayder.In the letter, seen by the Guardian, Boulton urges the government to “fully comply with international law and ensure the necessary humanitarian access” to support vulnerable populations in Tigray.‘Trying to survive’: millions in Tigray face hunger as they wait in vain for aidRead moreHe said the outlook for type 1 diabetes patients in Tigray was “terrible, as we used to see in the 19th century [before the discovery of insulin]”.“I’m not involved politically [in the conflict] on either side,” he told the Guardian. “But as president of IDF, especially at this time – it is 100 years, this year, since the first successful insulin injection was given in Toronto – our aim is that nobody, anywhere in the world, should die because they cannot get the treatments they need.”The government denies placing Tigray under blockade, blaming the TPLF for making aid delivery too dangerous. The UN’s World Food Programme (WFP), which has delivered all humanitarian cargo into the region on behalf of the World Health Organization, Médecins Sans Frontières and others, has also in the past accused the rebels of seizing its fuel, and for a long time refusing to return its aid trucks.The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) was able to start airlifting in some supplies of insulin and other medicines, with the support of the ministry of health, in January, after the IDF and others raised concerns about pharmaceutical stocks.On Thursday, a spokesperson for the ICRC said that all its flights and humanitarian convoys to Tigray had been suspended “until further notice” since the resumption of hostilities. WFP has not been able to lead a convoy into Tigray since 22 August.Fighting erupted between the TPLF and government forces in late August. The TPLF said federal troops and their allies had launched a big offensive towards southern Tigray. The government, however, accused the TPLF of striking first.",[{'name': 'Lizzy Davies'}],‘Humanitarian crime’: fighting cuts off insulin supply in Tigray
4,"The daughter of the late Anglican archbishop Desmond Tutu has been barred by the Church of England from officiating at her godfather’s funeral in a Shropshire church because she is married to a woman.Mpho Tutu van Furth, an ordained priest in the Anglican church, was invited to preside over the funeral of Martin Kenyon, who died last week at the age of 92. The C of E said its actions were “in line with the House of Bishops current guidance on same-sex marriage”.Tutu van Furth’s wife, Marceline, a Dutch academic, accused the C of E of homophobia. She said the couple had visited Kenyon in April, and he asked Mpho to preside over his funeral.“That she can’t do something out of love for her godfather and for the family just because of the same-sex marriage … that’s something that upsets me,” she said, according to a report in Voice of America.Kenyon’s family were forced to relocate Thursday’s funeral service from St Michael and All Angels church, in Wentnor, near Bishops Castle, to a marquee in the grounds of the former vicarage next door in order to allow Tutu van Furth to preside in an unofficial capacity.“The family are devastated at the church’s decision,” a family friend said. “Even in a conservative rural hinterland like Shropshire, people are appalled at what has happened. It’s unchristian and unjust.”In a statement, the Diocese of Hereford said: “We acknowledge this is a difficult situation.”The C of E permits clergy to be in same-sex relationships as long as they are celibate. The church does not conduct or bless same-sex marriages. The issue has been the cause of deep divisions within the C of E and the global Anglican church for decades.Kenyon, a former Welsh Fusilier and Old Etonian, had a brief moment of fame after complaining that he “couldn’t damn well find anywhere to park my car” when he was one of the first people to receive a Covid vaccination in December 2020.The next day on live television, he asked Piers Morgan, then presenter of ITV’s Good Morning Britain: “Who are you?”Kenyon had been friends with Desmond Tutu for decades. Both men were godfathers to each other’s daughters.Tutu, the former archbishop of Cape Town who won the Nobel peace prize in 1984, died last December. He gave a “father’s blessing” to his daughter’s same-sex marriage, but was barred by the South African church from officiating.Tutu championed LGBTQ+ rights, saying in 2013: “I would refuse to go to a homophobic heaven … I would not worship a God who is homophobic and that is how deeply I feel about this.”He added: “I am as passionate about this campaign as I ever was about apartheid.”Tutu van Furth was forced to give up working as a priest in South Africa in 2016 because the Anglican church there does not permit its clergy to be in same-sex marriages, although they have been legal in the country since 2006.

5,"More than 3.5 million children are at risk of dropping out of school due to the drought in the Horn of Africa, the United Nations has said, amid warnings the crisis could lead to “a lost generation” that misses out on education.According to new figures shared with the Guardian, Unicef now estimates that 3.6 million children in Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia are in danger of leaving school as a result of the cumulative pressure on households caused by the unrelenting drought.In a sign of how acute the situation is becoming in many areas, that number has more than tripled – from 1.1 million – in the past six months.Four consecutive failed rainy seasons have pushed millions of families to the brink, increasing the number of deaths of children from malnutrition and forcing people to flee their homes in search of more resources.But the drought also threatens to cause another, quieter ripple effect in the three worst-hit countries, said Abhiyan Jung Rana, Unicef’s education adviser for eastern and southern Africa.“In the Horn of Africa, there are about 15 million children out of school, including these countries. But the fear is that because of the drought an additional 3.6 million more children will drop out as they’re moving with their parents to different areas away from their school.”Teachers and activists in Somaliland, an autonomous region of Somalia, say they are already seeing this effect in their classrooms – and it is mainly girls who are leaving.“When the chips are down, it is always the girls who bear the brunt of the situation,” said Sadia Allin, country director for Plan International, which is working with communities in Somaliland to help them withstand the drought.Ethiopian drought leading to ‘dramatic’ increase in child marriage, Unicef warnsRead more“It is very worrying. Education provides immediate physical, psychological, and cognitive protection. For girls, being out of school is disappointing. It is impacting their dreams,” she said.“When girls feel they are losing that [education], it seems also that they are losing their rights.”Kiin Farah Hasan, the headteacher of a village school in the Toghdeer region of Somaliland, is praying that this year will be better for the girls at her school. By the end of the last academic year, after two rainy seasons failed, only 31 of the original 56 girls remained.“Some of the girls got married, some of them moved to other places because their parents migrated from here due to the drought,” she said. “And some of them, their families are poor and have nothing, even getting their livelihoods is hard for them.”Kiin said she had become used to teaching hungry children. “When we wonder about them being hungry, sometimes we give them a 30-minute break and order food from the market for them to eat, and for some I even cook food in my house and give [it to] them,” she said.Kiin Farah Hasan, a teacher in Toghdeer, Somaliland, says she is used to teaching hungry pupils and often prepares food for them herself. Photograph: Armstrong Kiprotich/Plan InternationalA proper school feeding programme, along with a school bus to cover the 3-6 mile (5-10km) journey to school, would enable many of those at risk to stay in education, she said. But the absence of these, combined with the added pressure on household incomes, has stacked the odds against children getting to school.Kiin said she believed “three or four” of the girls who dropped out had married since leaving school. “Maybe some of them got married by their own will, but that problem really affected me.”Child marriages often increase in times of drought or disaster as parents seek to raise extra funds through dowries.Unicef said it did not expect to see a discernible difference between the sexes in terms of the numbers of children at risk of dropping out, because the displacement of entire families, including boys and girls, was a major factor in their vulnerability.But Jung Rana said he did expect girls to be less likely to return to school, just as in the aftermath of Covid lockdowns, which in some places coincided with higher rates of early marriage, teenage pregnancy, and gender-based violence.Famine: what is it, where will it strike and how should the world respond?Read more“I would foresee something similar happening because, in a sense, schools are closed for them and they’re there with their parents or with their families, and these kinds of things would likely be happening more,” he said.He added: “Girls especially are looked on in households to be able to provide the caregiving aspects … more than boys would be, in terms of taking care of their smaller siblings and taking care of chores around the home or wherever they are. I think, with those conditions, they are more likely not to go back.”Women collect water in Xidhinta in Somaliland. An estimated 13 million people are facing severe hunger in the Horn of Africa as a result of drought, the UN says. Photograph: Daniel Jukes/APSpeaking from Hargeisa, the capital of Somaliland, Allin said it was vital that donor countries such as the UK recognised that droughts and other crises could have severe repercussions on girls’ education, and provide funding accordingly. Liz Truss, Britain’s new prime minister, has in the past declared women and girls to be a priority.“My message to her and to the world is that education is just such a powerful thing … and if we don’t provide these girls with the resources that they need to stay in education, it will [mean the] loss of a generation and [be] very costly in the future,” she added.Unicef estimates that 1.57 million children – roughly equal numbers of girls and boys – are at risk of dropping out of school in Kenya, 1.14 million in Ethiopia and 900,000 in Somalia, including Somaliland.It says factors that increase the chances of a child dropping out include the displacement of the family to other villages with limited educational capacity, a lack of school feeding programmes, and parents’ inability to afford essentials such as books and uniforms.",[{'name': 'Lizzy Davies'}],Horn of Africa drought puts 3.6m children at risk of dropping out of school
6,"Twenty people were missing after a boat carrying Cuban migrants sank off Florida due to Hurricane Ian, further underlining the human cost of the storm.Hurricane Ian: more than 2m without power as Florida hit with ‘catastrophic’ wind and rainRead moreUS border patrol said it responded to a migrant landing in Stock Island, in the lower Florida Keys, Reuters said.Four migrants swam to shore after their vessel sank, hours before the hurricane made landfall in Florida.Three more people were rescued in the water and taken to hospital with heat exhaustion and dehydration symptoms, the US coast guard said.A search and rescue effort led by the coast guard was under way.On Tuesday, seven people also from Cuba were taken into custody after making it to shore in Pompano Beach, Florida, just north of Fort Lauderdale, CBS News said.Officials used social media to issue a warning about making the dangerous journey by sea, even after Hurricane Ian passes.“Do not risk your life by attempting this journey at sea. Storm surge along with King tide can create treacherous sea conditions even after a storm passes,” they said.Hurricane Ian battered Cuba, killing at least two people and leaving much of the island in total blackout. Millions were already facing daily power interruptions.After making landfall in Florida, one of the most intense storms to make landfall in the US has continued to wreak havoc on hospitals and other essential infrastructure.A hospital in Port Charlotte, Florida, an hour outside Venice, experienced major flooding in its lower-level emergency room and had the roof of its intensive care unit torn off, the Associated Press reported.Medical staff at HCA Florida Fawcett worked quickly on Wednesday to move its most vulnerable patients to other floors, as water flooded the hospital from above and below.The hospital has four floors. Only two remained usable.Dr Birgit Bodine, who was there when the roof came off, said patients had been mostly understanding amid damage from the storm but staff were worried about the potential influx of patients with storm-related injuries.“The ambulances may be coming soon and we don’t know where to put them in the hospital at this point,” Bodine said, noting that patients were “doubled or tripled up” given the lack of space.Bodine added: “For us, as much as everything is terrible and we’re exhausted … as long as our patients do OK and nobody ends up dying or having a bad outcome, that’s what matters.’",[{'name': 'Gloria Oladipo in New York'}],Twenty Cuban migrants missing after boat sinks during Hurricane Ian
7,"Hurricane Ian, one of the most powerful storms ever to strike the US mainland, has battered south-west Florida with high winds, rain and storm surges as it weakened and moved inland.More than 2m homes and businesses were left without power as the storm swept ashore in south-west Florida on Wednesday afternoon, bringing “catastrophic” 150mph (240km/h) winds and a deadly storm surge of up to 18ft. Hours later, the storm – estimated to be about 140 miles (225km) wide – was downgraded from a category 4 to a category 1 storm as it moved slowly north-east, causing major flooding.The true scale of the damage remained unclear as darkness fell, with power and communications networks down, and emergency services workers forced to take shelter from the worst of the storm.Residential areas in Fort Myers Beach and several other coastal cities were almost completely submerged, buildings were damaged, and trees and power lines brought down. The utility company Florida Power and Light warned those in Ian’s path to brace for days without power.MapIn coastal Florida, desperate people posted to Facebook and other social sites, pleading for rescue for themselves or loved ones. A local sheriff’s office reported that it was getting many calls from people trapped in flooded homes.A flooded street in downtown Fort Myers, Florida. Photograph: Marco Bello/ReutersMillions of Florida residents remain directly in the crosshairs of the storm, which was expected to remain a powerful hurricane with gusts well above 100mph as it continued on a path north-east toward Orlando, and the Atlantic coast on Thursday.“Pray for people,” the state’s governor, Ron DeSantis, told reporters.“There’s some storms that really leave an indelible impact … this is going to be one of those historic storms and it’s going to shape the communities in south-west Florida and have a profound impact on our state.“This is going to be a rough stretch. So we just ask people for their thoughts and their prayers. This is a major, major storm.”map of Hurricane Ian’s pathThe storm surge flooded the lower-level emergency room of the HCA Florida Fawcett hospital in Port Charlotte, while fierce winds tore part of the fourth-floor roof from its intensive care unit, according to Dr Birgit Bodine, who works there.Intensive care staff were forced to evacuate the hospital’s sickest patients – some of them on ventilators – to other floors. The medium-sized hospital spans four floors, but patients were forced into just two because of the damage.Bodine said incoming storm injuries could make things worse. “The ambulances may be coming soon and we don’t know where to put them in the hospital at this point,” she said. “Because we’re doubled and tripled up.”Ian had already been blamed for several deaths and unprecedented flooding in Cuba, which was beginning to restore electricity to regions on Wednesday after a total wipeout of power on the island.Meanwhile, a search for more than 20 people was under way off the coast of Florida after a boat carrying migrants from Cuba to the US mainland sank. Several passengers were rescued from the waters.Joe Biden promised the full support of federal resources for search and rescue missions, and then the recovery effort in Florida, which officials warned would be changed forever by the impact of the storm.“We’ll be there to help you recover, we’ll be there to help you clean up and rebuild, [and] to help get Florida moving,” the US president said in an address from the White House, adding that his federal emergency declaration means thousands of national guard troops had been activated and millions of liters of water, food and generators were on their way.Ian approached Florida after passing over Cuba and the Caribbean sea as a powerful tropical storm, and building strength in the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico.Torrential flooding and powerful winds were captured in dramatic video posted to social media that showed trees uprooted, lashing rain and submerged cars. A Weather Channel meteorologist who has covered more than 90 storms in his career said that he had experienced nothing like Hurricane Ian in over 30 years.We were in the eye wall of Cat. 4 #Hurricane #Ian for over 5 hours and the back side was the worst.I haven't experienced anything close to this in over 30 years @weatherchannel pic.twitter.com/wfEqcuEBAm— Mike Seidel (@mikeseidel) September 29, 2022

More than 2.5 million people were under evacuation warnings along the western Florida coast, although officials said an unknown number had chosen to stay and attempt to ride out the storm. Authorities warned those who remained would be on their own because conditions were too dangerous for emergency crews to be out.“The response from emergency medical services, fire and police will be stopped,” said Kevin Anderson, the Fort Myers mayor.“So you know those who chose to stay put themselves in that risk.”News anchors at the Fort Myers television station Wink had to abandon their usual desk and continue storm coverage from another location in their newsroom because water was pushing into their building near the Caloosahatchee River.Some broadcasters drew criticism for covering the dangerous conditions in person; one meteorologist was seen being hit by a flying branch.Elsewhere, flamingos at St Petersburg’s famous Sunken Gardens rode out the storm in a bathroom. In 1992, the Miami Zoo sheltered its flamingos in a similar way. Zoo animals are difficult to move, and during major storms, they are often moved to sheltered or secure structures within the grounds.🦩🌀We're hunkered down!

Ian was originally predicted to make landfall around Tampa, 12o miles further north, before taking a gradual turn to the south and east after moving away from Cuba.But with the storm’s size having grown wider than the Florida peninsula over the last 24 hours, effects were felt miles inland, and authorities said almost all areas faced some kind of threat.“The majority of the state of Florida is in Ian’s crosshairs,” Deanne Criswell, administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) said.“We need everyone to heed the warnings of their local officials before, during and after the storm.”People walk in the receding waters of Tampa Bay due to the low tide and tremendous winds from Hurricane Ian.

8,"More than 1,700 murders of environmental activists were recorded over the past decade, an average of a killing nearly every two days, according to a new report.Killed by hitmen, organised crime groups and their own governments, at least 1,733 land and environmental defenders were murdered between 2012 and 2021, figures from Global Witness show, with Brazil, Colombia, the Philippines, Mexico and Honduras the deadliest countries.The NGO has published its report on the killings of land and environmental defenders around the world every year since 2012, after the murder of Chut Wutty, a Cambodian environmentalist who worked with the Global Witness CEO Mike Davis investigating illegal logging. Killings hit a record of 227 in 2020 despite the pandemic.“Wutty prompted us to confront a range of questions. What was the global picture, what were the implications of such attacks and what could be done to prevent them?” wrote Davis in the report.The killings have disproportionately affected lower-income countries and Indigenous communities; 39% of the victims were from this demographic, despite it making up only 5% of the world’s population.Mining and extractive industries, logging and agribusiness were the most common drivers for a murder when a cause was known. The report’s authors warned the figures were likely a significant underestimate and do not capture the full scale of the problem, with the deaths often occurring in ecosystems crucial to averting the worst impacts of the climate crisis.The 200 people killed in 2021 included eight park rangers in Virunga national park in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which is facing the added threat of oil and gas extraction, the environmental activist Joannah Stutchbury, who was shot outside her home in Kenya, and Ángel Miro Cartagena, who died in Colombia and was one of 50 small-scale farmers killed last year.In June this year, the journalist Dom Phillips, who wrote extensively for the Guardian and the Observer, and Bruno Pereira, a Brazilian expert on uncontacted tribes, were murdered in the Javari valley in Brazil’s Amazon after going missing. Phillips was working on a book about sustainable development called How to Save the Amazon and Pereira was helping him with interviews. The investigation into their murders continues.“It’s important to picture these victims as the real people they are. It’s easier for me. I have been surrounded by land and environmental defenders all my life, and indeed I am one of them,” wrote the Indian environmentalist Dr Vandana Shiva in the report foreword.“We are not just in a climate emergency. We are in the foothills of the sixth mass extinction, and these defenders are some of the few people standing in the way. They don’t just deserve protection for basic moral reasons. The future of our species, and our planet, depends on it,” she said.The report noted, however, that there have been some significant victories for environmental campaigners. In South Africa last year, Indigenous communities from the Wild Coast of South Africa’s Eastern Cape won a legal victory over Shell, forcing the company to halt oil exploration in whale-breeding grounds. The ruling was upheld earlier this month.In May this year, communities on Sangihe Island, Indonesia, won a lawsuit against a Canadian-backed company planning to mine gold on their island after having a previous challenge thrown out for technical reasons.“While the numbers of killings have remained high, one thing I took away from doing this research was that there have been some significant victories by environmental defenders over the last few years, including against huge multinationals,” said the report’s author Ali Hines, a campaigner at Global Witness.‘They attacked with machetes’: murder, mafias and illegal mining in Peru’s gold fieldsRead moreMore than two-thirds of the murders of people trying to protect forests, rivers and other ecosystems between 2012 and 2021 took place in Latin America, with 342 killed in Brazil and 322 in Colombia. In Mexico, 154 were killed, and 117 in Honduras. The Philippines was another country of concern, with 270 murders.“This is a global problem but it is almost exclusively happening in the global south,” said Hines. “Corruption and inequality are two kinds of key enabling factors for the killings. For example, in the land titling process, there can be investment deals between companies and corrupt officials. Defenders who try to seek justice are sometimes up against judges paid off with bribes. That leads on to the third factor, which is the high rates of impunity. Cases are very rarely credibly investigated, never mind perpetrators brought to justice.”The report urges governments to create a safe civil space for environmental defenders and promote legal accountability of companies, helping to ensure zero-tolerance for violence against activists.The Colombian and Filipino governments did not respond to a request for comment from the Guardian about the high rate of murders. The Brazilian government said environmental defenders and communicators, including journalists, were protected by a national programme, which could be joined voluntarily.Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",[{'name': 'Patrick Greenfield'}],"More than 1,700 environmental activists murdered in the past decade – report"
9,"At least 10 armed groups in Colombia, including the Gulf Clan crime gang and dissident members of the Farc rebels who rejected a peace deal have agreed to participate in unilateral ceasefires, according to the government.‘It’s total terror’: Colombian cartel retaliates over kingpin’s arrestRead morePresident Gustavo Petro, who took office in August, has promised to seek “total peace” with armed groups, fully implementing a 2016 peace accord with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) and meeting with dissidents and gangs.“Each group with its own identity, nature and motivation is expressing its disposition to be part of a total peace, in this exploration phase we’ve asked them not to kill, not to disappear people and not to torture,” Danilo Rueda, the government’s high peace commissioner, told journalists at an impromptu press conference. “We are moving ahead.”Among the groups are two Farc dissident groups – the Central General Staff and Second Marquetalia – as well as the Clan del Golfo, the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta Self-Defence and others Rueda did not name.Illegal armed groups in Colombia – whose six-decade conflict has killed at least 450,000 people – count about 6,000 fighters in their ranks, according to security sources.Leftist rebels and crime gangs both participate in extortion, murder, drug trafficking and illegal gold mining.Petro – himself a former member of the M-19 urban guerrillas – has said his government could offer reduced sentences to gang members who hand over ill-gotten assets and give information about drug trafficking.Colombian leader’s promise of ‘total peace’ may prove too ambitiousRead more“The office of peace is exploring the judicial mechanisms to permit the transition of armed groups to rule of law,” said Rueda, who previously met with Farc dissidents.

10,"Brian “Smokey” Osmond was cooking at his home in Newfoundland’s coastal Port aux Basques when he spotted flood waters creeping into his garage on Saturday morning.Osmond moved his truck up a hill to safety. But as he returned, a powerful storm surge struck.‘We’re natural fighters’: Cubans brave sweeping power cuts in Hurricane Ian aftermathRead more“I went back in the door and a wave took me and I went under,” he told CBC News. “I thought I was gone.”Osmond was dragged towards the cove before miraculously freeing himself. When he arrived, soaking wet, at a neighbour’s house, he watched in disbelief as a second wave completely destroyed his home.“It was just luck,” he said. “It wasn’t my time to go.”In the days since post-tropical storm Fiona battered Atlantic Canada, the scope of devastation has become painfully clear for residents. The powerful derecho, the worst to ever hit the region, killed two people, flattened dozens of homes, washed land into the ocean and left hundreds of thousands in Nova Scotia, southern Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island without power. As residents look to the daunting cleanup and rebuilding efforts, experts says the hundreds of millions in damage highlights the need to build defensively against the effects of climate change.“Unfortunately, the reality with climate change is that there’s going to be more extreme weather events. We’re going to have to think about how to make sure we’re ready for whatever comes at us,” prime minister Justin Trudeau told reporters as he witnessed the destruction in Nova Scotia. The federal government has dispatched nearly 600 Canadian Armed Forces soldiers to help with the cleanup and pledged immediate aid to residents.Larger urban centres such as Halifax were largely spared the worst of the storm, but houses across the region were reduced to rubble and debris, roads washed away, and thousands of trees knocked town by uncharacteristically strong winds, which gusted at 190km/h at their peak.By Wednesday, more than 160,000 people were still without power and heavy rain in some parts hampered cleanup efforts.“We’ve been hit by something bigger than we’ve ever been hit with before,” Dennis King, the premier of Prince Edward Island, told reporters. “We’re all feeling the effects of that. We’re all very fragile.”Damage caused by Hurricane Fiona in Fox Roost-Margaree, Newfoundland. Photograph: Susan Sweet-Skinner/AFP/Getty ImagesPrince Edward Island, famed for its agriculture, is bracing for significant destruction to potato, soybean and apple crops, which are among the main economic drivers of the province. Fishing boats and potato-storage buildings were also heavily damaged. A spokesperson from Parks Canada said the force of the storm left a “shocking” level of erosion in its wake. Much of the island is hemmed in with distinct red sands, which help keep the ocean at bay. In many areas, the dunes were swept into the ocean, and it will take years for nature to rebuild.While Trudeau lamented the destruction, he also praised the “tremendous stories of resilience” that have emerged.In the hard-hit Nova Scotia town of Glace Bay, Carol and Leo Yang, the owners of Jay’s Chicken and Ribs, handed out hundreds of free hot meals to residents, cooking under the light of donated flashlights with a propane stove.“We started out just trying to help neighbours. But as a restaurant owner, I knew there was something more we could do,” Carol told the Guardian.Hundreds of residents have lined up outside the Yangs’ two locations for their first hot meal in days. Customers, some of whom have no houses to return to, hugged her as she handed them the boxed-up food.“They tell me the meal has warmed their bodies and their hearts,” she said.She and her husband worked as pharmacists in China before immigrating to Nova Scotia 10 years ago. They bought the restaurant six years ago and run it with their young daughter.Yang says more than 1,000 meals have gone out to those in need and donations have come in – locally and from other provinces – to help her family keep cooking.The devastation is expected to costs hundreds of millions, according to early estimates from insurers, putting it on track to become the costliest storm in the region’s history. Because storm surges are not covered by insurance, many residents will likely have to bear the cost themselves.“This type of destruction actually gives us a golden opportunity to put things back in a better way,” said Glenn McGillivray, the managing director of the Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction. “And it’s critical because we’re going to see more of these in these intense storms future. Climate change is a direct reason for that. The east coast has to get better prepared.”He said all new infrastructure projects or rebuilds should go through a climate assessment. McGillivray also cautioned against rebuilding in areas where climate risk is highest, including coastal communities.“The storm did exactly what the forecasters said it would do. It went where they said it would go. And it was as powerful as they said it was going to be. The damage came from very high winds, very heavy rains and storm surges, especially in small, isolated communities,” he said.“And so we saw those Newfoundland saltbox buildings, sitting perched on the rocks that you see on postcards, they just can’t handle this kind of storm.”While Ottawa has increasingly highlighted and supported improvements to construction, McGillivray says more needs to be done for resilience within the federal building code.“We just have this propensity to kind of put things back the way they were. Everybody wants to get their life back to normal as soon as possible, which is understandable. But that’s not going to work in a changing climate.”",[{'name': 'Leyland Cecco in Toronto'}],Canada begins Storm Fiona cleanup as scale of devastation becomes clear
11,"A Myanmar fashion model who was denied entry to Thailand and feared arrest by the military government in Yangon if she was forced back home from exile has flown to Canada, which she says has granted her asylum.Thaw Nandar Aung, also known as Han Lay, left on a flight from Bangkok’s Suvarnabhumi airport early on Wednesday, according to Archayon Kraithong, a deputy commissioner of Thailand’s Immigration Bureau. He said he was not authorised to reveal her destination.Thaw Nandar Aung told the US-government-funded broadcaster Radio Free Asia on Tuesday that she was headed to Canada after being granted political asylum there with the assistance of the United Nations high commissioner for refugees (UNHCR) and the Canadian embassy in Thailand.“Everything happened so fast, and I only have a few pieces of clothing. So I will have to go along with what they have planned for me,” she said.Myanmar model who criticised junta stuck in limbo after being denied entry to ThailandRead more“I have spoken out for Myanmar wherever I go. I have talked to the media about my country while I was staying in Thailand. Since Canada is a safe place for me, I will have more opportunities to speak out on the issue. And as you know, there is a large Myanmar community in Canada, so I’m sure I’ll be able to carry on the struggle for Myanmar with their help.”Thaw Nandar Aung had been stuck at the Bangkok airport after Thai authorities denied her entry when she arrived on 21 September from a short trip to Vietnam. She had been living in Thailand but needed to leave and enter again in order to extend her stay.While at the airport she met UNHCR representatives in an effort to avoid being sent back to Myanmar. People denied entry to Thailand are usually deported to their last point of departure, but the UN agency advised her she would be arrested in Vietnam and then repatriated to Myanmar. A Thai foreign ministry spokesperson said she had been denied entry into Thailand “due to an issue with her travel document”.Thaw Nandar Aung denounced her country’s military rulers last year from the stage of the Miss Grand International beauty pageant held in Bangkok. She accused them of selfishness and abusing their power for using lethal force to crush peaceful protests, and appealed for international help for her country.Myanmar’s military seized power in February 2021 from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi and has cracked down heavily on widespread opposition to its rule. Critics, including actors and other celebrities, have been arrested on charges that carry penalties ranging from three years’ imprisonment to death.In July, authorities executed four activists who were accused of involvement with terrorist activities, and UN experts have described the country’s violence as a civil war.Thaw Nandar Aung said she was charged in absentia in September last year with sedition for speaking out against the military takeover at the pageant and online. The charge carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison.The New York-based organisation Human Rights Watch accused Myanmar’s military government of revoking or otherwise interfering with Thaw Nandar Aung’s passport, making her “the victim of a deliberate political act by the junta to make her stateless when she flew back from Vietnam to Thailand”. It said the tactic was used against other critics as well.“There is no doubt that what transpired was a trap to try to force Han Lay to return to Myanmar, where she would have faced immediate arrest, likely abuse in detention, and imprisonment,” Phil Robertson, the group’s deputy Asia director said in an emailed statement. “Fortunately, she got good advice to stay put at the airport, and wait for the kind of protection she needed. This was a victory for rights, and refugee protection.”",[{'name': 'Associated Press in Bangkok'}],Myanmar model who criticised junta says Canada has granted her asylum
12,"The US vice-president, Kamala Harris, has condemned North Korea’s “provocative nuclear rhetoric” during a trip to South Korea that included a visit to the heavily armed border dividing the peninsula.Harris arrived in Seoul on Thursday, hours after North Korea fired two short-range ballistic missiles into the sea, in a move that underlines Washington’s struggle to rein in the regime’s weapons programme.Her visit to the demilitarised zone (DMZ) – which has divided the peninsula since the 1950-1953 Korean war ended in an uneasy truce – was intended to demonstrate the US’s commitment to South Korea, a key ally in the region.Harris looked through binoculars as a South Korean colonel pointed out military installations on the southern side. An American colonel then pointed out some of the defences along the military demarcation line, which marks the boundary between the two Koreas, including barbed wire fences and mines.“It’s so close,” Harris said.Earlier, she told US military personnel at a nearby base “how grateful and thankful we are” for their role in protecting the southern side of the tense border between the two Koreas.North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, has overseen a record number of missile launches this year, including one that involved a long-range weapon. Officials in Seoul and Washington have warned that Pyongyang could be preparing to carry out a nuclear test.In a meeting in Seoul with the South Korean president, Yoon Suk-yeol, Harris praised the alliance between the two countries as a “linchpin of security and prosperity. I’m here to reinforce the strength of our alliance and strengthen our work together”.Yoon, a conservative who took office in May, called her visit “another turning point” in strengthening bilateral ties.They reaffirmed their commitment to the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula and “condemned [North Korea’s] provocative nuclear rhetoric and ballistic missile launches, in violation of UN security council resolutions”, the White House said in a statement. “They discussed our response to potential future provocations, including through trilateral cooperation with Japan.”The DMZ has become a regular stop for visiting US officials eager to demonstrate their resolve on North Korean weapons’ development and their commitment to the security of South Korea, where 28,5000 US troops are based.The 155-mile (250km) long border is highly fortified with razor wire, heavy armaments and tank traps on either side of a 2.5-mile wide buffer.Ronald Reagan was the first US president to visit the DMZ, but Bill Clinton – who described it as “the scariest place on Earth” during a 1993 visit – and Donald Trump are the only sitting presidents to have visited the Joint Security Area, a cluster of buildings that hosts inter-Korean talks, and the only place where troops from both sides directly face each other.Harris’s visit comes at a time of rising tensions on the peninsula. This week, the US and South Korea launched large-scale naval exercises for the first time in five years. The allies insist that their joint drills are purely defensive, but North Korea routinely condemns them as rehearsals for an invasion.Earlier this week, Harris condemned Pyongyang’s “illicit weapons programme” during a speech at a naval base in Japan, where she also attended the state funeral of the country’s former prime minister Shinzo Abe.Speculation is building that North Korea is preparing to detonate a nuclear device in what would be its seventh nuclear test since 2006. Pyongyang claimed that its most recent test, in 2017, involved its most powerful weapon to date.This week, the South Korean spy agency said North Korea appeared to have completed a third tunnel at its Punggye-ri nuclear site as part of preparations for a test, according to a South Korean MP who attended a closed-door briefing by the National Intelligence Service.The lawmaker said Pyongyang was likely to conduct the test after the end of the Chinese Communist party congress, which begins on 16 October, and before US midterm elections on 8 November.Kim Jong-dae, of the Yonsei Institute for North Korean Studies, said the latest missile launches were an attempt by the regime “to gain an upper hand on the peninsula with a nuclear arsenal at its disposal”.That and other launches were “a harbinger of Pyongyang’s aggressive posturing to come next month – with missile launches and a possible nuclear test”, Kim added.",[{'name': 'Justin McCurry in Tokyo and agencies'}],Kamala Harris hits out at North Korea’s ‘provocative nuclear rhetoric’ on DMZ visit
13,"A Hong Kong court has sentenced pro-democracy figure in exile Ted Hui to three-and-a-half years in jail over charges related to the 2019 protest movement.The ruling in Hong Kong’s high court on Thursday, reported by local media, is the first time someone has been sentenced in absentia over the protests.Hui, a former legislator who fled to Australia via Europe in early 2021, was sentenced for contempt of court in cases related to his involvement in the protests, and alleged misconduct in the chamber of the legislature. In June he was convicted in absentia of breaching his bail conditions after prosecutors successfully argued he had abandoned the right to defend himself.Help Hong Kong residents flee before it’s too late, fugitive democracy figure urgesRead moreIn a statement on Wednesday evening, Hui dared the judge, Andrew Chan, to deliver a sentence “the heavier the better”.“Since I am in a free country, no matter how severely Judge Chan sentences me – 10 years or eight years in prison – it won’t harm my personal freedom or reputation, nor my international lobbying work,” he said.“The only objective effect of the heavy code is to exacerbate the degeneration of the rule of law in Hong Kong, and let the world see how the Hong Kong courts are willing to cooperate with tyranny and persecute citizens who are fighting for democracy and freedom.”Hui still faces multiple charges, including over a protest in July 2019, but has previously told the Guardian the charges were unfair and often based on fake testimony. He said the charges relating to contempt of the legislature for two incidents involving scuffles between politicians, and protests against pro-Beijing legislators, were “ridiculous”.He has also been accused of “foreign collusion” under the national security law, over social media posts seeking international support for Hong Kong.Hui is among a number of pro-democracy figures who have fled overseas as the government crackdown targets dissidents, politicians, journalists and protesters. Thousands have been charged over the protests, while hundreds of others detained or prosecuted under the national security law.

14,"New Zealand will ban live animal exports from next April, two years after storms sank a livestock ship, killing 41 crew members and 6,000 cattle.The death of two New Zealanders among the crew of the Gulf Livestock 1, which sank in a September 2020 typhoon, helped galvanise the movement to ban exports of live sheep and cattle.The animal welfare amendment bill was signed into law on Thursday, with the government saying it would protect New Zealand’s reputation as consumers become more ethically conscious. “It protects the reputation of not just our farmers now, but the farmers of the future,” the agriculture minister, Damien O’Connor, said.Live exports have long been controversial in Australia and New Zealand, and subject to long-term campaigns by animal rights groups. When they go wrong, they often result in thousands of animals drowning.Earlier this year, more than 15,000 sheep drowned after a live export ship sank in Sudan, and in 2020 a capsize killed 14,000 sheep. In 2021, 3,000 cattle were stranded at sea for three months, leaving many dead, dying, starving or extremely dehydrated.Because New Zealand is so remote, even a best-case-scenario journey is often arduous for animals.Live animal exports are being used as cover by smugglers, say NGOsRead more“New Zealand’s remoteness means animals are at sea for extended periods, heightening their susceptibility to heat stress and other welfare-associated risks,” O’Connor said.“Despite any regulatory measures we could put in place, the voyage times and the journey through the tropics to the northern hemisphere markets will always impose challenges.”All of the country’s exports of livestock by sea will stop on 30 April 2023. New Zealand exported 134,722 cattle last year, and live exports represented about 0.6% of primary sector exports. New Zealand only exports animals for breeding, not slaughter.The move has been welcomed by the Green party and animal rights activists. “This could not have come soon enough,” said the Greens animal welfare spokesperson, Chlöe Swarbrick. “Animals have been suffering in live export for years.”The opposition National party opposed the bill, saying it was a “disproportionate” and “ideological” response to the “the tragic sinking of the stock ship Gulf Livestock 1”.They argue that the move to end live exports could reduce gross domestic product by up to $472m.In 2020, Britain announced plans to ban the export of live animals for slaughter and fattening from England and Wales, but that plan has not yet been brought into force.In Australia, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, recently reaffirmed his government’s commitment to ending the trade, but said it would not be phased out before 2025.",[{'name': 'Tess McClure in Auckland'}],New Zealand bans live animal exports from April 2023
15,"An estimated 90,000 people have been displaced by violence in the highlands of Papua New Guinea since May, with about 25,000 children unable to attend school and reports of rape, kidnapping and other violence, say the UN and local officials.The fighting has been related in many cases to the recent national elections, in which around 50 people were killed and schools and other public buildings burnt down.“While in some cases, there are residual disputes over election results that are triggering sporadic violence, in other cases, such as in Porgera, the root causes are due to other reasons, and the instability of the election period was capitalised upon to reignite old disputes,” said Themba Kalua, UN resident coordinator and UN women country representative.Dozens killed and thousands displaced in election fighting in Papua New Guinea, UN saysRead moreKalua said that the UN estimates about 265,000 people had been affected by the 2022 general election-related violence in Enga, Southern Highlands and Hela (Highlands Region), leaving almost 90,000 people displaced.“The displaced persons are primarily women, children, people with disabilities, and the elderly who have been displaced from their communities while non-disabled men remain and fight. The challenge in getting a precise count remains as displaced persons frequently move about due to ongoing security concerns or in search of resources.“Women and children are the most affected. An estimated number of 25,000 learners are unable to attend school as schools in the affected areas remain closed. At least 70 women and girls now have been victimised by rape, kidnapping, or sorcery accusation-related violence.”Porgera crisis management coordinator, Nick Pakea, who is also the president of the Porgera Chamber of Commerce, said more than 60,000 people from Porgera Paiela in Enga have been severely affected by election-related violence and tribal fights.Papua New Guinea election violence: what has caused it and what can be done?Read morePakea said the troubles began when the Porgera mine was closed down, and worsened during the election when security forces were sent in to extract the 2022 general election ballot boxes.“More than 20 clans … clashed. Sixty thousand people were displaced, with many families fleeing to Mt Hagen in Western Highlands for refuge,” he said.“Those who do not have the means to seek refuge elsewhere are here. Our women and girls are left very vulnerable to sexual assaults and attacks. Our children are not attending schools.”“We have not received any support from the district, provincial or national government or from the US and UN as reported. Maybe help is still on its way, but on the ground, we have yet to see that help,” he said.The US government, through its international development agency USAID, provided $3.1m to support displaced persons and survivors of violence in the affected areas. This was in addition to the $100,000 donated in July for immediate humanitarian assistance.The United Nation’s Population Fund have also been supporting women and children affected by the violence in the highlands and distributing reproductive health kits, but it says challenges in reaching communities have been immense.“Schools and health facilities were also badly affected by the election-related violence. Rural health centres are severely understaffed and facing shortage of basic medicines. But the roadblocks [that have] been set up have remained one of the main challenges affecting our ability to reach the most vulnerable in the communities.”Meanwhile, police in PNG have also set up a taskforce investigating team with 40 investigators to look in election-related violence.",[{'name': 'Rebecca Kuku in Port Moresby'}],"PNG election violence: 90,000 displaced since May, 25,000 children unable to attend school"
16,"A popular Chinese film depicting a love story amid the hardships of life in rural China has been removed from all streaming services just weeks after its release, and discussion of it censored on social media.Return to Dust had been widely praised by audiences for its realistic and moving depiction of rural life in China. For the same reason it had also drawn criticism from nationalistic voices accusing it of portraying China in a negative light.The sudden disappearance of the film, which premiered at the Berlin international film festival, prompted widespread accusations the film was censored amid heightened sensitivity in China ahead of its most important political meeting, the party congress.China’s Lipstick King reappears, months after Tiananmen ‘tank cake’ rowRead moreThe couple at the centre of the film – played by film star Hai Qin and a local farmer and untrained actor Wu Renlin – fall in love after coming together in an arranged marriage. They navigate hardships relating to health, housing, and poverty, while living in a rural village being targeted for development.However, the party congress is in less than a month, and authorities are under pressure from the central government to ensure an atmosphere of national positivity and stability.After a delayed release in national cinemas, the arthouse film became a hit, topping box office takings in its ninth weekend. But then in mid September it reportedly began screening with an amended ending, in line with edits of other films at odds with Communist party ideology, before being dropped entirely from cinema listings.It remained available on multiple streaming sites until this week.On Tuesday a social media hashtag related to the film’s removal from streaming services had been viewed about 300,000 times, but only a handful of comments remained visible. The hashtag was later censored, with a Weibo error message saying it was unsearchable “due to relevant laws, regulations, and policies”.Among visible comments a few people supported its removal, with one viewer fearing the negative portrayal could be used by the west “to smear China”, but the majority was critical, with one asking “has Chinese art become a complete tool of the ruling class?”“Does it have to be a happy, thriving family scene to be real?” asked on Weibo user.“Hide the suffering, the suffering will not exist,” said another.The Guardian contacted the Chinese streaming platforms but they declined to comment.

17,"The US vice-president, Kamala Harris, is to visit the heavily armed border separating North and South Korea on Thursday, amid rising tensions on the peninsula.Harris will arrive at the demilitarised zone (DMZ) on the southern side of the border, days after the regime in Pyongyang warned that South Korea and the US risked “triggering a conflict” following the launch of large-scale naval exercises for the first time in five years.Harris’s visit to the DMZ will “underscore … the United States’ commitment to stand beside [South Korea] in the face of any threats” posed by North Korea, a White House official said.North Korea rejects Seoul’s ‘absurd’ offer of economic aid for denuclearisationRead moreHarris will be the most senior member of the US administration to go to the inter-Korean border since Donald Trump walked across the demarcation line into North Korea during a meeting with the country’s leader, Kim Jong-un, in 2019.She will “reflect on the shared sacrifice” of tens of thousands of US and Korean soldiers killed in the 1950-53 Korean war, which ended with a ceasefire but not a peace treaty, and “tour sites at the DMZ, meet with service members and receive an operational briefing from US commanders”, the official added.North Korea has conducted a record-breaking number of weapons tests this year, including one involving an intercontinental ballistic missile that was fired at full range for the first time since 2017.US and South Korean officials have warned for months that Pyongyang could be about to conduct what would be its seventh nuclear test, while some analysts have said the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, may wait until after the Chinese Communist party national congress, which begins on 16 October.North Korea has traditionally avoided doing anything to embarrass China, its biggest ally and trading partner.Officials in Washington and Seoul have promised a “swift and forceful” response to any nuclear test.The North indicated that it is determined to develop more sophisticated weapons with the test launch of a short-range ballistic missile on Sunday.The launch came the day before the US and South Korea – where 28,500 American troops are based – began joint drills involving the aircraft carrier the USS Ronald Reagan and its battle group off the Korean peninsula’s east coast.Harris, who attended the state funeral for Shinzo Abe in Tokyo on Tuesday, was due to address US sailors in Yokosuka, south of Tokyo, on Wednesday before flying to South Korea.She was expected to repeat Washington’s commitment to Japan’s security, and to warn China against aggressive moves towards Taiwan, days after the US president, Joe Biden, said the US would defend the island if China attempted to invade.“She will get into threats to the international rules-based order and how she sees them,” including recent provocations across the Taiwan strait, a senior administration official said.“She will speak about that and what we are doing to push back against those efforts and stand up for the international rules and norms that have guided this region.”Harris’s DMZ visit will be the first by a high-ranking US official since House speaker Nancy Pelosi went in August, prompting the North to condemn her as the “worst destroyer of international peace”.",[{'name': 'Justin McCurry in Tokyo'}],Kamala Harris to visit Korean demilitarised zone as naval drills stoke tensions
18,"Carbon offsets are questionable, dangerous and far from a good investment for companies hoping to reduce their environmental impact, Australia’s richest man has said.Andrew Forrest, a billionaire turned philanthropist who made his fortune in mining and minerals, is turning his vast iron ore extraction operation, Fortescue Metals Group, into a zero carbon business.Unlike most companies, Fortescue is not seeking net zero greenhouse gas emissions but what Forrest described as “real zero”. To achieve net zero, many companies use carbon credits, awarded for projects such as planting trees or preserving existing forests, to count against their greenhouse gas emissions.Climate journalism, open to allForrest thinks this is a mistake and instead plans to use entirely renewable energy and zero-carbon technologies to transform his business.“Companies think they can continue piling emissions into the world, and cover their tracks with carbon offsets,” he said.“But carbon credits are really questionable,” he told the Guardian in an interview in London. “We are pushing beyond carbon credits.”Having examined the market for carbon credits, Forrest has concluded that only about 10% to 15% of available credits represent real reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.“I am an ecologist and I have seen how these credits get valued. Some are from just planting trees where trees would have been growing anyway,” he said. “Carbon credits are dangerous.”They are being relied upon increasingly as companies seek to become net zero but questions about the market for offsets are intensifying. Earlier this week, the airline Easyjet announced it would no longer use carbon offsetting to reach its net zero goals, but will invest further in low-carbon technologies for aviation.Easyjet to stop offsetting CO2 emissions from DecemberRead moreThe Guardian conducted a wide-ranging investigation of the market for forestry credits last year and found numerous problems, including “phantom credits” and questions over whether credits awarded for preserving and planting trees represented genuine “carbon sinks”.Forrest said the carbon markets merited deep investigation. “There are all sorts of cranks out there selling carbon credits,” he said. “This abuse must stop.”Forrest’s Minderoo Foundation charity targets plastic pollution , modern slavery and the climate crisis. Nicknamed Twiggy, he has announced plans to give away most of his $27bn fortune, has been criticised in Australia for controversial proposals on welfare for low-income people, for mining on Indigenous land, and by those who argue that tax is a better redistribution of wealth than philanthropy.Fortescue, whose profits topped US$6bn (£5.5bn) last year, will use solar and wind power, electric vehicles, hydrogen and hydro-electricity with pump storage to make its operations zero carbon by the end of this decade. Surplus renewable energy would be used to pump water uphill during times of excess generation, to be released to generate power when needed.Forrest insisted the strategy was not only technically feasible but could be achieved at a profit, thanks in part to the plummeting cost of wind and solar energy, and the soaring price of fossil fuels.“The biggest cost saving is on buying the fossil fuels,” he said. “Wind and sun don’t send you a bill at the end of the month. We have seen [from the Ukraine war and global gas crisis] how foolhardy it is to rely on fossil fuels.”Heavy industries, such as mining, have long been regarded as among the hardest sectors to decarbonise, but Forrest said the falling costs of renewable energy generation and the rapid development of technologies, such as batteries and hydrogen, meant there was little excuse for the sector not to move swiftly.He urged other companies to follow his lead. “The question is not why are we doing it – it’s why everyone else is not doing it.”",[{'name': 'Fiona Harvey Environment correspondent'}],"Companies using carbon credits to ‘cover their tracks’, says iron ore billionaire"

21,"The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, says she has had preliminary conversations with the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, seeking federal backing for plans to build the world’s largest pumped hydroelectricity project in the state’s north.Palaszczuk was in Mackay on Thursday to unveil details about the proposed Pioneer-Burdekin project, which will take about a decade to plan and build.She said the 5GW project was the “centrepiece” of the Queensland energy plan announced Wednesday, which envisages large-scale construction of renewables and the early closure of coal-fired generators. Under the plan, reliance on burning coal would cease by about 2035.

However the Pioneer-Burdekin project remains in the very early stages and still requires significant planning and funding. The government said while it was confident the proposal is viable, it would continue to assess potential backup options.Queensland government pledges to end reliance on coal-fired power by 2035Read moreThe estimated cost for the project is $12bn. The Queensland government is yet to commit any money, though the project would probably not begin construction until 2025 at the earliest.It is expected the state would seek a significant federal contribution to the construction cost. “I’ve had very preliminary first conversations with the prime minister, and I know how much he is interested in nation-building infrastructure,” Palaszczuk said.Queensland Hydro, the new government entity designated to build the project, is expected to complete detailed geotechnical and environmental studies in 2024.In the meantime, the organisation will “also continue to investigate other large-scale, long-duration pumped hydro sites in the event the project is unable to proceed,” a government statement said.On Thursday Palaszczuk and the state’s energy minister, Mick de Brenni, said about 50 homes would be inundated under the plans, which involve the construction of three reservoirs. Negotiations will need to be conducted with the land owners and with Indigenous traditional owners.Environmental groups have largely welcomed the state’s renewable ambitions outlined in the energy plan. But some have also raised concern about the impacts of projects like the Pioneer-Burdekin.The Mackay Conservation Group on Thursday said it was concerned about the local environmental impacts of the project.“All of the water in the Pioneer catchment is already fully allocated for farmers, drinking water, and environmental flows,” said the group’s coordinator, Peter McCallum.“There simply is no available unallocated water to operate a pumped hydro scheme under the Pioneer valley water plan.

22,"When Ilya returned from work on Wednesday, his wife was waiting for him with his military draft papers. Ilya said he quickly packed his bags and departed the next morning for his local recruitment centre in Irkutsk, a city on Lake Baikal in Siberia.“When the motherland comes calling, you have to answer,” the 27-year-old bus driver said in a brief phone interview from a training ground near the southern city of Rostov. “I decided that I am not going to dodge the draft and will defend the country.”‘I will cross the border tonight’: Russians flee after news of draft Read moreVladimir Putin’s mobilisation order has triggered a run for the borders by tens of thousands of men of fighting age who are unwilling to participate in Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.But standing in stark contrast to the mile-long lines to get out are videos of men across the country, to the applause of their wives and mothers, boarding buses that will take them to training centres, in what is likely to be a one-way journey for many.The men are evidence of some public backing for the war in Ukraine and of the growing polarisation in the country, said Denis Volkov of the Levada Centre, an independent polling agency. “The nation has split, and mobilisation has further exacerbated existing divisions,” Volkov said. “The western-oriented, more modern, urban segment of the population wants to leave and is against the draft. But there is still a large core of men that will not avoid the draft. They are often less educated, poorer and more reliant on the state.”The Kremlin, seemingly aware of those divisions, has been eager to tap into more rural areas for its mobilisation drive, with authorities reportedly looking to keep recruitment “to a minimum” in regional capitals.A poll published by Volkov’s Levada Centre on Thursday found that the proportion of Russians who “fully” or “somewhat” support what the Kremlin calls its “special military operation” has dropped since Putin ordered the mobilisation, but still stands at 72%. “Society consolidated when the war started, that will not change overnight,” Volkov said.While some observers have questioned the logic of polling public opinion in a country where information about the war is carefully curated by state television and opposition is punishable with prison time, Volkov said he believed the results were credible.He said a key source of support for the Russian military was the notion – hammered home daily on state television and held by many in the country – that Russia is engaged in a broader war with Nato and the United States.Interviews and polls show that some Russians have also accepted the Kremlin’s unfounded claim that Russia is under siege from the west and had no choice but to invade Ukraine.“My husband is fighting not only against Ukraine but also Nato. We don’t have many allies,” said Lyudmila, whose husband, Sergei, was mobilised this week.Since the start of the mobilisation, Telegram groups have sprung up in which women share tips on how to stay in touch with their partners or sons. Lyudmila, who runs one of the groups, said: “I am proud of my husband. Russia is pinned against the wall and we have to fight back.”For some men, a perceived inability to dodge the draft – an offence punishable by as much as 10 years in prison – has led them to reluctantly turn up at recruitment centres. “I don’t want to fight, but I can’t hide for ever, it is better to just face what is coming,” said Igor, from St Petersburg, who received his draft papers on Wednesday.But despite many Russians’ continued support for Putin’s invasion, Levada’s poll found that 70% of respondents had reacted with “fear” “terror” and “shock” to the mobilisation orders. It also found that Putin’s approval ratings had dropped by six points, the biggest decrease since the start of the war, with only a quarter of men under the age of 24 in favour of continuing the fighting in Ukraine.According to Andrei Kolesnikov, of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a US thinktank, Levada’s latest numbers hint at growing anger over the war among many in Russia. “It’s just the beginning, discontent is slowly maturing,” he said.The public’s anxiety over mobilisation is only likely to grow after the first videos emerged from training centres this week showing scores of men subjected to poor conditions as they wait to be sent to Ukraine.Expect dissent to rise as Putin’s call-up brings Ukraine war home to RussiansRead moreIn one video, a group of men are seen sleeping on the floor in overcrowded army barracks. In other footage, a recently mobilised unit appears to have been dropped off in an isolated field with no shelter or food rations. “There is fucking nothing here. Like a flock of sheep, we have to self-mobilise,” one of the men grumbles.There are also growing reports that newly mobilised men are tasked with buying their own equipment, ranging from bulletproof vests to sleeping mats and thermal underwear. “We spent over 30,000 rubles [£460], my monthly salary, to prepare him for the army,” said Tatyana, a school teacher from the Ural city of Chelyabinsk, whose husband has been mobilised.She said the lack of basic supplies in the army had shocked her, denting some of her previously held beliefs about the state of the country’s military and about the war. “How can they ask him to fight there when everything is such a mess?” she said. “The war should stop.”",[{'name': 'Pjotr Sauer'}],"‘I will defend the country’: while some Russians flee draft, others head to war"

Including nuclear weapons. The Russian leadership has said this directly without any hesitation.”The territories were not named formally but Kremlin pool reporters said four treaties would be signed, corresponding to the four regions Russia has indicated it plans to annex.Putin is expected to make a speech to members of the State Duma, Russia’s lower house of parliament, at Friday’s ceremony. By law, Russia’s Federation Council must approve the treaties before they are signed by Putin but it was not clear when the council was scheduled to meet.Moscow officials have also begun preparing a venue for a major concert near Red Square on Friday evening. “Together forever,” reads a large banner hanging over a stage that also bears the names of the four Ukrainian regions. State television channels are also displaying a countdown until Friday’s event at the Kremlin. Russian soldiers standing on Red Square where a banner on a stage reads: ‘Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson – Russia!’ Photograph: Alexander Nemenov/AFP/Getty ImagesPutin’s decision was believed to be an attempt to halt a Ukrainian counterattack that has forced Russia to retreat from much of the Kharkiv region and is now threatening to retake more territory in Donetsk. He hopes that the threat of all-out war and a nuclear retaliation will reduce western support for the Ukrainian offensive.Ukraine and its supporters have decried Putin’s threats as “nuclear blackmail”. In remarks earlier this week, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, vowed to defend and free Ukrainians in the occupied territories.“This farce in the occupied territory cannot even be called an imitation of referendums,” Zelenskiy said on Tuesday in a video posted on Telegram. “We will act to protect our people: both in the Kherson region, in the Zaporizhzhia region, in the Donbas, in the currently occupied areas of the Kharkiv region, and in the Crimea.”Ukraine’s presidential office said Zelenskiy had spoken to his Polish counterpart, Andrzej Duda, on Thursday about the international reaction to Russia’s illegal referendums. “We discussed specific steps and measures that we will work on in this context, military and defence cooperation,” Zelenskiy wrote on Telegram.The two leaders “agreed on the need for a powerful consolidated world reaction to the illegal actions of the Russian Federation, which destroy the foundations of international law”, the statement from Zelenskiy’s office read. “Specific steps and measures that the parties will work on in this context were discussed.” Zelenskiy also had a call with the outgoing Italian prime minister, Mario Draghi, on Thursday afternoon. According to Zelenskiy’s office, the main topic of their discussion was the need for a firm reaction to the fake referendums.“They are worthless and do not change reality. The territorial integrity of Ukraine will be restored. And our reaction to Russia’s recognition of their results will be very harsh,” Zelenskiy said, according to the statement from his office.Zelenskiy also said he was convening an “urgent” meeting of the national security council on Friday, with details to be announced later. The Kremlin does not have full control over many of the territories it is seeking to annex. It is likely the Kremlin will lay claim to all four Ukrainian regions in their entirety, including several mid-size cities that are not under Russian control. For instance, in the Zaporizhzhia region, local occupation officials claimed that the recent “referendum” included the entire region, including the city of Zaporizhzhia, which had a prewar population of 750,000. That would mean the Kremlin is obliging the country to fight in perpetuity to defend territories and make advances even while it is on the defensive on the battlefield.The Kremlin may only reveal the details of which territories it is claiming to annex during the signing ceremony. A state budget revealed on Thursday showed that Russia had earmarked 3.3bn roubles ($56.3m or £51.1m) to rebuild the regions. The damage to the city of Mariupol alone was estimated by its mayor at $14bn. The annexation will make the chance of a negotiated settlement to end the war even more remote. Russia amended its constitution in 2022 to forbid ceding territory the country has formally annexed.It was initially seen as a way to prevent a future Russian leader from ceding Crimea, which was annexed in 2014. But the law would also forbid Russia from ceding territories occupied since February or those not currently under Kremlin control.Ekaterina Schulmann, a Russian political scientist, wrote that after annexation, the “Russian Federation as we knew it will pass into a new phase of its existence, having become a state with a delegitimised border, including fragments that not only won’t be recognised by any state or international organisation de jure, but won’t be controlled by its central administration de facto”.",[{'name': 'Andrew Roth in Moscow and Isobel Koshiw in Kyiv'}],"Putin to sign treaty annexing territories in Ukraine, Kremlin says"

Vladimir Putin will sign a decree annexing four occupied regions in Ukraine tomorrow, the Kremlin has announced. Russian state-owned news agency Tass cites Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, as saying that the ceremony of the signing of agreements into the Russian Federation will be held on Friday at 3pm Moscow time.
The total area set to become de facto part of Russia amounts to about 15% of Ukraine and includes an estimated 4 million people. Following the signing ceremonies in the Kremlin, Putin will give a major speech and will meet with Moscow-appointed administrators of the Ukrainian regions, the Kremlin said.
On Moscow’s Red Square, giant video screens have already been set up, with billboards proclaiming “Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson – Russia!”
President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said overnight Ukraine will “act to protect our people” in Russian-occupied regions after what he described as “an imitation of referendums”. Ukraine’s foreign ministry said Kyiv and its allies “condemn such actions of Russia and consider them null and worthless”.
Zelenskiy’s spokesperson Sergii Nykyforov has said Ukraine’s president has called an emergency meeting of security and defence officials for Friday.
Sweden’s coast guard earlier this week discovered a fourth gas leak on the damaged Nord Stream pipelines, a coast guard spokesperson told the Svenska Dagbladet newspaper.
Politicians across Europe have warned that the suspected sabotaging of the two Nord Stream pipelines could herald a new stage of hybrid warfare targeting vulnerable energy infrastructure in order to undermine support of Ukraine. Norway’s prime minister, Jonas Gahr Støre, said his country would step up its military presence at Norwegian installations after the country became Europe’s largest supplier of natural gas.
Denmark’s foreign minister, Jeppe Kofod, has said that “intentional” explosions caused the leaks in the Nord Stream pipelines, and that it was an “unprecedented” attack.
Nato has said leaks from the Nord Stream gas pipelines appeared to be “deliberate acts of sabotage” and vowed a “united and determined response” to any attacks on their critical infrastructure.
The Kremlin on Wednesday dismissed claims that Russia was behind the attack on the Nord Stream gas pipelines, describing them as “quite predictable and also predictably stupid”. In a call with reporters, the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said the incident needed to be investigated and that the timings for the repair of the damaged pipelines were not clear.
The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, has proposed a fresh round of sanctions on Russia designed “to make the Kremlin pay” for escalating the conflict in Ukraine. The proposed eighth package of “biting” sanctions includes a cap on the price of Russian oil and further curbs on hi-tech trade.
An EU official has given a briefing to Reuters saying that an agreement on the next sanctions package against Russia is expected before next week’s EU summit, or at least major parts of the package.
Hungary will not support the EU’s proposed new round of sanctions if they include energy sanctions, a government official has said.
A report drawn up by an international working group on sanctions concluded Russia should now be declared a “state sponsor of terrorism” and had reached the legal definition of a terrorist state under US and Canadian law. The head of the Office of the Ukrainian Presidency, Andriy Yermak, called for sweeping American and European sanctions in light of the report, after Ukraine accused Russia of sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines under the Baltic Sea.
Britain’s prime minister, Liz Truss, told Zelenskiy in a phone call Wednesday that the UK would never recognise Russian attempts to annex parts of Ukraine, Downing Street said. The EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, also denounced the “illegal referenda and their falsified outcome” in Ukraine.
Israel has strengthened its hitherto cautious stance on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, saying it will “not accept the results of the referendum in the eastern districts” of the occupied country. Tuesday night’s statement from the Israeli foreign ministry, which also said it “recognises the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine”, has been received as an unprecedented show of support for Ukraine, and a rare Israeli rebuke to Moscow.
Russia has escalated its use of Iranian-supplied “kamikaze” drones in southern Ukraine, including against the southern port of Odesa and the nearby city of Mykolaiv, amid estimates that hundreds of weapons may now have been deployed by the Kremlin in Crimea and other occupied areas of the south.
The head of Ukraine’s presidential administration, Andriy Yermak, has said six Ukrainians have been exchanged in a prisoner swap. The six included two civilians, who were arrested and taken to Russia because of the content on their phones, and four Ukrainian soldiers, who fought in Mariupol. They have been returned to Ukraine.

From midnight Finnish time Thursday (9pm GMT), Russian tourists holding an EU Schengen visa will be turned away unless they have a family tie or compelling reason to stay.
Authorities in the Russian region of North Ossetia, which borders Georgia, are reportedly putting in place travel restrictions to prevent people fleeing to Georgia to avoid conscription. The report by the Moscow Times cites the head of the region, Sergey Menyaylo, as saying that more than 20,000 people had entered Georgia through the section of the border in just the past two days.
The UK ministry of defence has claimed in its latest intelligence briefing that more men have now likely fled conscription from Russia’s partial mobilisation than Russia initially used in its invasion force of Ukraine.
Russian authorities say they are establishing checkpoints at some of the country’s borders to forcibly mobilise Russian men seeking to avoid mobilisation by fleeing the country. Social media footage shows military vehicles moving toward the border, reportedly to establish the mobilisation checkpoint.
Ukrainian authorities said Wednesday they have identified five Russian soldiers who allegedly shot at civilian cars in the Kyiv region during the first days of the war. The Russian soldiers are charged with killing five people, and injuring a further six, who were trying to flee Hostomel on 25 February, a day after Russia invaded.

25,"French ministers have been photographed in puffer jackets and polo necks instead of suits, in an attempt to set an example on wrapping up warm as the nation struggles to afford heating this winter.But political opponents attacked the government’s winter wardrobe messaging as nannying and out of touch with people’s struggles over the energy crisis and cost of living.The far-right Marine Le Pen, who heads the largest opposition party in parliament, made a comparison to the French queen Marie Antoinette, tweeting: “Don’t have enough heating? Let them wear cashmere.”After the president, Emmanuel Macron, said people would need to save energy and lower their heating, the prime minister, Élisabeth Borne, raised eyebrows this week when she held an office meeting seated at her desk wearing a zipped-up puffer jacket.Pendant le « col roulé gate » de @BrunoLeMaire… la PM @Elisabeth_Borne ne veut pas être en reste et continue à arborer une doudoune lors de ses entretiens à Matignon (à l’intérieur).

This came after the economy minister, Bruno Le Maire, was asked by a listener on a radio programme whether government offices would delay putting on their heating until December, as the listener’s child’s school was having to do.Le Maire said everyone was saving energy.

The energy transition minister, Agnès Pannier-Runacher, seemed to go one step further, appearing at an event alongside the prime minister wearing a polo neck as well as a thin puffer jacket with her suit jacket over the top. Gaspard Gantzer, a former communications adviser to the Socialist president François Hollande, said it was “grotesque” and “paternalistic” form of messaging. “There’s an element of ‘my dear children, do as your parents do, wear a big jumper.’”Macron warns of ‘end of abundance’ as France faces difficult winterRead moreThomas Porcher, an economist, told France Inter radio: “I don’t expect an economy minster for the sixth or seventh economy in the world to tell me to put a polo neck on.

26,"Germany’s finance minister has vowed that he will not follow the UK “down the path of an expansionary fiscal policy” as his government announced a €200bn (£177bn) fund designed to protect consumers and businesses from rising gas prices driven by Russia’s war in Ukraine.Europe’s largest economy will reactivate an economic stabilising fund previously used during the global financial crisis and the coronavirus pandemic, said the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, at a joint press conference with the finance minister, Christian Lindner, and the economic minister, Robert Habeck, on Thursday afternoon.Truss says she has ‘right plan’ on economy and will not change courseRead more“Prices have to come down. That is our conviction,” said Scholz, adding: “For them to come down, we will need a big defence shield.”Expansionary fiscal policies include tax cuts and government spending with the aim of boosting the economy. But they run the risk of causing high inflation and devaluing the currency, as has happened in the UK.Lindner, of the fiscally hawkish Free Democratic party, said the energy price package would not entail further regular borrowing, adding that Germany was “expressly not following Great Britain’s example down the path of an expansionary fiscal policy”.“This process is not risky,” he later added.The economic stabilising fund was set up in 2020 and filled with €500bn to aid businesses affected by lockdown measures. While it is still financed by the state taking on new debt, the fund can only be used for paying for specific measures and thus does not count as part of the regular household budget.Critics say the special crisis fund is a sleight of hand that will allow Germany only on paper to return next year to the debt-to-GDP ratio restrictions that Lindner’s party has championed. The new €200bn “shadow budget” for the energy crisis comes on top of a €100bn fund for rebuilding its military and a €60bn booster for a special fund for climate protection measures that have been passed by Scholz’s coalition government.At the heart of the package is a temporary cap on electricity and gas prices, which the government says it wants to bring down “to a level where private households and companies are protected from being overloaded”. The difference between the cap and the prices paid by gas importers on the world market would be made up by the state.In a significant U-turn, Scholz’s government is also scrapping a gas levy on consumers that was due to come in this Saturday. The levy was originally designed to compensate energy suppliers for the increased import costs. But after being agreed by the three coalition parties this summer, it was increasingly seen as politically toxic for rewarding some energy companies already raking in record profits.Sign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterArchie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morningPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The head of Germany’s federal network agency warned earlier this week that savings targets were not being met and that households were using more, rather than less, gas than in previous years.

27,"Iran has launched a deadly cross-border airstrike into northern Iraq to punish Kurds for their role in supporting demonstrations over the death of a 22-year-old Kurdish woman in Iranian police custody that are still rattling the Tehran regime.As many as 13 people were killed and 58 injured in the Iranian drone strikes on military bases in northern Iraq that belong to the exiled Kurdish Democratic party of Iran.The KDPI said in a statement: “The forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran attacked the bases and headquarters of the Kurdistan Democratic party of Iran with missiles and drones.”Iran said it was attacking terrorist bases, while the US described the strikes as brazen.The attack occurred as the Iranian president, Ebrahim Raisi, addressed the nation to express his regret over the death of Mahsa Amini a fortnight ago, but also to accuse the protesters of being agents of foreign powers.“The enemy has targeted national unity and wants to pit people against each other,” the ultraconservative president said.Raisi said Iran would not tolerate “chaos and riots” but also said that there could be “dialogue” on “different methods of applying the law” – a possible reference to Iran’s morality police’s strict enforcement of compulsory hijab.It was the first time Raisi has directly addressed the street protests on national TV but his mention of dialogue is unlikely to assuage an assertive young generation of Iranians who have lost faith in the elderly clerical establishment – especially as it was the hardline president who ordered a stricter application of the hijab laws earlier this summer.Activists in Iran, speaking to the Guardian on condition of anonymity, said: “Our confidence is growing. We are not backing down despite the arrests. It is very beautiful. There is a belief that something is going to change this time.”How the death of a Kurdish woman galvanised women all over IranRead moreLawyers acting for Amini’s family have, in defiance of regime pressure, filed a formal complaint against those responsible for her arrest. They have demanded a detailed independent investigation into her death, including the manner of arrest and transfer to hospital, as well as photographs and videos of the arrest, and any brain scans.Amini, now a symbol of resistance to the regime, died in police custody after she was picked up by the morality police in Tehran for not wearing a hijab properly.The KPDI urged its supporters inside Iran to return to the streets, with its London spokesperson saying: “Support for these demonstrations is building. This started about one Kurdish woman and the wearing of the hijab, but it is now something wider in over 100 cities. The chant in the streets is: ‘Death to the regime. Death to the dictator.’”Reports on the number of deaths amid the protests differ; the Oslo-based human rights group Iran Human Rights said the figure was at least 76, while Iran’s semi-official Fars news agency has put the toll at “around 60”, including several members of the Iranian security forces.The regime will be desperate to ensure the protests do not extend to more working-class districts, and is likely to portray the protesters as anti-patriotic liberals at odds with the values of the regime.Iran’s police said on Wednesday they would confront protests “with all their might”. However, the country’s minister for women’s affairs, Ensieh Khazali, said she had visited arrested women in jail and was seeking the release of those not guilty of major offences.The UN said its secretary general, António Guterres, had called on Raisi not to use “disproportionate force” against protesters.“We are increasingly concerned about reports of rising fatalities, including women and children, related to the protests,” the UN chief’s spokeperson, Stéphane Dujarric, said.Iran has shut down the internet to prevent protesters using social media to inform the outside world of the scale of the repression. Up to 20 reporters have been arrested, and newspapers are increasingly toeing the government line that the protests are being manipulated by Saudi Arabian or western media. Some papers are staging debates on whether the compulsory hijab is required by sharia law.The regime has continued to claim the west’s response followed what it regarded as a successful performance by Raisi at the UN general assembly in New York. But the regime is being battered by the persistence of the demonstrations and the willingness of prominent Iranians, including musicians, actors, sports stars and academics, to demand the voice of young Iranians be respected.Fatemeh Motamed-Arya, an award-winning actor, appeared without hijab to speak at the funeral ceremony of fellow actor Amin Tariokh. The Iranian football coach and former player Ali Karimi has also backed the demonstrations, as has the composer Hossein Alizadeh.In Britain, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British Iranian dual-national who spent five years in an Iranian jail, cut her hair for BBC Persian cameras to show solidarity with the protests in Iran.Companies said the continued shutdown of the internet was damaging business.On Tuesday, authorities in Iran arrested the daughter of the former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani for “inciting rioters”, the Tasnim news agency reported. They have also been threatening celebrities and football stars who have supported the protesters.",[{'name': 'Patrick Wintour Diplomatic editor'}],Iran launches airstrike against Kurdish group in northern Iraq
28,"A prominent Palestinian-French human rights lawyer has gone on hunger strike in protest against his imprisonment without charge by Israeli authorities for the last six months.Salah Hamouri, 37, a father of two from occupied East Jerusalem, has been held in administrative detention since 7 March, and his detention order has been renewed until at least early December based on undisclosed evidence.Along with 29 other people held in administrative detention in prisons around Israel, Hamouri on Sunday began an open-ended hunger strike to protest against the Israeli practice, which is routinely used against Palestinians who are subject to Israel’s military, rather than civil, justice system.Negotiations with Israeli officials on Wednesday did not yield results, a member of the #JusticeforSalah campaign said. The human rights lawyer has been moved to a 2 x 2 sq metre isolation cell in Hadarim, a maximum security prison.Administrative detention allows suspects’ arrest for renewable six-month terms without charge or access to the evidence against them, on the grounds that he or she may break the law in future.Israel says the measure – which is also practised by the Palestinian Authority – is necessary for foiling terrorist attacks and to avoid revealing sensitive intelligence sources. Rights groups allege it is used excessively by Israeli authorities and denies individuals the right to due process.According to the Palestinian prisoners’ rights group Addameer, where Hamouri works, 743 Palestinians are being held in administrative detention, the highest number for six years.Hamouri has been imprisoned by Israel on several previous occasions, including serving a seven-year sentence between 2005-11 for his alleged role in a plot to assassinate a chief rabbi.After maintaining his innocence during three years of pre-trial detention, he eventually took a plea bargain on the advice of his lawyer in order to avoid a 14-year-sentence or deportation to France, which would most likely mean losing his Israel-issued Jerusalem residency.In 2016, his pregnant wife, French national Elsa Lefort, was deported after arriving at Tel Aviv’s airport and given a 10-year entry ban. She and the couple’s two young children live in France, and have not been allowed to visit or even speak to Hamouri on the phone since he was detained in March.“Salah has never stopped being vocal about the occupation. He is always speaking at events in France and tours, talking about the conditions of political prisoners and other violations,” said a spokesperson for #JusticeforSalah.“Treating him like this is a way to try and silence him, to break him, and send a message to other human rights defenders.”Of the four legal cases Hamouri is fighting, one is of particular concern to rights organisations: in a legal first, the lawyer’s Jerusalem residency was revoked in October 2021 on the grounds of a “breach of allegiance” to the Israeli state, based on secret evidence. A final hearing in the residency case is scheduled for February 2023.In a statement, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said that Hamouri was detained on suspicion of activity in the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, which is designated as a terrorist organisation by Israel’s western allies.“Moreover, it was determined that the confidential material in his case indicates that his release will impair the security of the area,” a spokeswoman said.The last high-profile Palestinian hunger strike involved the Islamic Jihad member Khalil Awawdeh, who almost died after going without food for nearly six months. He ended his strike in August after Israel agreed to release him when the administrative detention order expires on Sunday.

29,"Mohammed bin Salman has been named prime minister of Saudi Arabia in a move that experts said would probably shield the crown prince from a potentially damaging lawsuit in the US in connection to his alleged role in the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi.Saudi Arabia announced on Tuesday that King Salman was making an exception to Saudi law and naming his son as prime minister, formally ceding the dual title of king and prime minister he had personally held until now.The development is not likely to change the balance of power in Saudi Arabia, where the 37-year-old prince is already seen as the de facto ruler of the kingdom and heir to the throne.But the timing of the decision was seen by critics of the Saudi government as almost certainly linked to a looming court-ordered deadline next week. The Biden administration had been asked by a US judge to weigh in on whether Prince Mohammed ought to be protected by sovereign immunity in a case brought by the fiancee of Khashoggi, Hatice Cengiz. Such protection is usually granted to a world leader, such as a prime minister or a king.In July the administration sought a delay in filing its response to the court, which had initially been sought by 1 August. John Bates, a district court judge, agreed to extend the deadline to 3 October. Among other issues, he called on the administration to state whether it believed Prince Mohammed ought to be granted immunity under rules that protect countries’ head of state.“It seems like [Prince Mohammed] has been advised to take this step before the response of the Biden administration was due on 3 October,” said Abdullah Alaoudh, the Gulf director at Dawn, a pro-democracy group based in Washington, who is a party to the Khashoggi lawsuit. “Practically, [becoming prime minister] makes no difference.”The White House did not immediately comment. Prince Mohammed has denied he had personal involvement in the Khashoggi murder. A US intelligence assessment found that the future king was likely to have ordered the killing.The decision to name Prince Mohammed as prime minister would also likely assuage any lingering concerns in Saudi Arabia that the crown prince could be arrested or otherwise face legal challenges while traveling abroad.The civil complaint against Prince Mohammed, which was filed by Cengiz in the federal district court of Washington DC in October 2020, alleges that he and other Saudi officials acted in a “conspiracy and with premeditation” when Saudi agents kidnapped, bound, drugged, tortured and killed Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018.Khashoggi, a former Saudi insider who had fled the kingdom and was a resident of Virginia in the south-east US, was a vocal critic of the crown prince and was actively seeking to counter Saudi online propaganda at the time when he was killed.Cengiz said in a statement to the Guardian: “The fight for justice must succeed – it will not be stopped because MBS bestows another title on himself.”Critics of the Saudi regime, including activists who are living in exile in the US and Europe, have warned that the crown prince’s crackdown on dissent has intensified in recent months.The Guardian has learned that the UK government has sought to intervene in at least one high-profile case, involving Salma al-Shehab, a Leeds University PhD student who was arrested, charged, convicted and sentenced to 34 years in prison after she returned home from the UK for a holiday. Her crime, under Saudi law, was using Twitter to follow and sometimes like or retweet tweets by dissidents and activists.The Guardian was told by a source requesting anonymity that officials in the British embassy in Riyadh have raised concerns about Shehab’s case with Saudi authorities. Tariq Ahmad, a Conservative peer, has also raised the case in a 25 August meeting with the Saudi ambassador to the UK, the source said.The UK government will face more pressure to act this week with the expected release of a letter by 400 academics, including staff and research students from UK universities and colleges who are seeking urgent action on Shehab’s case.The letter calls on Liz Truss, the prime minister, and foreign secretary James Cleverly to “publicly condemn Salma al-Shehab’s sentencing and make representations to their Saudi counterparts for her immediate release”. It was sponsored by the pro-democracy group Alqst, which advocates for human rights in Saudi Arabia. The group said: “Salma should be looking forward, like us, to the new academic year, instead of languishing behind bars for the ‘crime’ of tweeting her legitimate opinions.”The letter notes that Shehab, a 34-year-old mother of two children who worked as a dental hygienist and had received a scholarship to study in the UK, was arrested on 15 January 2021 while on holiday in Saudi Arabia. Court records show she was placed in solitary confinement, questioned and held for 285 days before her trial. She denies the allegations against her.Truss has so far not indicated that she will be likely to adopt a critical stance toward her new counterpart. The British prime minister had a phone call with Prince Mohammed this week in which her office said she thanked him for helping to get five British detainees released by Russian-backed forces. She also offered the UK’s “continued support and encouragement for progress in Saudi Arabia’s domestic reforms”.",[{'name': 'Stephanie Kirchgaessner in Washington'}],Mohammed bin Salman named prime minister ahead of Khashoggi lawsuit
30,"Qatar has called up hundreds of civilians, including diplomats summoned back from overseas, for mandatory military service operating security checkpoints at World Cup stadiums, according to a source and documents seen by Reuters.The deployment of conscripts, some of whom would normally defer national service because their work is considered vital, highlights the logistical challenge faced by the tiny Gulf Arab state hosting one of the world’s biggest sports tournaments.The conscripts are training to manage stadium security queues, frisk fans and detect contraband such as alcohol, drugs or weapons concealed in ponytails, jacket linings or even false bellies, according to training materials seen by Reuters.Qatar has a population of 2.8 million – of whom barely 380,000 are Qatari nationals – and expects an unprecedented influx of 1.2 million visitors for the tournament. It already has an agreement with Turkey, which is supplying 3,000 riot police.In early September, the civilians were ordered to report for pre-dawn duty at the national service camp north of the Qatari capital, Doha, according to order papers seen by Reuters, less than three months before the 29-day tournament kicks off.The civilians were told they had been called up to assist with the World Cup and that it was their “patriotic duty” to do so, the source said. “Most people are there because they have to be – they don’t want to get in trouble,” the source said.Some volunteers are also training alongside the conscripted force, according to the source, who has direct knowledge of the plan and the training.Asked for comment, a Qatari government official said in a statement that Qatar’s national service programme would continue as normal during the World Cup.“Recruits will provide additional support during the tournament as part of the regular programme, just as they do every year at major public events, such as the national day celebrations,” the statement added.Prove World Cup will be safe, England LGBTQ+ supporters’ group tells QatarRead moreSince 2014, Qatari men aged between 18 and 35 have trained with the military for at least four months as part of mandatory national service introduced by the emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani. Dodging the duty can mean a year in prison and a fine of 50,000 Qatari rials (£13,000).The current group of civilians were on four months of paid leave from their jobs at key Qatari institutions such as the state-owned QatarEnergy and the foreign ministry, the source said. The diplomats are expected to return to their posts after the World Cup.Conscripts reported to the national service camp five days a week, where they attended training sessions conducted by officials from the security division of Qatar’s World Cup organisers, the supreme committee for delivery and legacy, the source said.They were taught to approach fans with “positive body language, focus and a smile”, the source said, to abide by the universal declaration of human rights, and avoid discriminating against fans on any basis, the source said.Training also includes hour-long marching drills on the parade ground.The 80,000-capacity Lusail Stadium, built for the final, had its first near-capacity crowd earlier this month.

31,"When a young Kurdish woman, Mahsa Amini, died in regime custody 10 days ago, Kurdish corners of Iran were the first to erupt; their anger at leaders they say have long oppressed them had an incendiary effect in their towns and cities.The death of the 22-year-old while on a visit to Tehran – allegedly for wearing her headscarf incorrectly under the country’s hijab regulations – quickly became a potent symbol of defiance for a minority group that had long harboured nationalistic ambitions, which rarely stayed hidden, and often eschewed the values of the country’s hardline leaders.But something happened along the way to what could have been a Kurdish nationalist uprising; Iranians from across the country fast shared in the outrage of the death of Amini and the collective indignity it represented to a greater population. Soon protesters on the streets of most of the country’s provinces were testing the limits of state forces. “It is not an Iranian revolution, or even a Kurdish revolution,” said Rozhin, 25, from the Kurdish city of Kermanshah. “It is a women’s revolution.”Demonstrations against the theocratic state’s stance towards women show little sign of slowing down in many parts of Iran. Women, who bear the brunt of state constraints, have been particularly vocal, tearing down pictures of Grand Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the assassinated general Qassem Suleimani. Both acts were unthinkable even months ago, but so too was the spectacle of large numbers of women – Kurdish, Persian and minorities – taking to the streets without hijabs.“It’s now not about Kurdish movement, neither about Persians,” said Karim, 27, from the town of Bokan. “It’s about 85 million humans who are fighting back for their rights, socially, economically and in every aspect of life. One week ago a Kurdish girl was a stranger in the capital of Iran and now her face is known everywhere around the globe. This is not about national movement – this is beyond that; it’s about women, and it’s about our basic human rights.“At this moment, every individual is thinking about fundamental aims and problems to be solved. But I do not guarantee that after one year the Kurds have another way of thinking about Persians.”Kurds in Iran account for roughly 10% of the country’s population, and make up roughly a quarter of the greater Kurdish presence in the Middle East, scattered between west and eastern Iran, northern Iraq, northern Syria and southeastern Turkey. A century after the breakdown of post-first world war Ottoman boundaries, there is no Kurdish state, and numerous groups vie among populations to claim leadership roles among what remains a fractured population whose search for a homeland has remained elusive.Five years ago this week, Iraq’s Kurds held a referendum on statehood, which was passed overwhelmingly. However, within days, Iraq’s army, led by powerful militias and directed by Suleimani, pushed north to seize the oil city of Kirkuk and retake much of the land seized by Kurds after the ousting of Saddam Hussein in 2003.Ever since, there have been few moments to galvanise Kurds in either Iraq, or Iran –until Amini’s death in the custody of Iran’s morality police. The feared enforcers have become central targets of the demonstration and held up as examples of where Kurds diverge from the central government.“There is no doubting the Kurdish revolutionary fervour that Mahsa Amini’s death has sparked among Iran’s long-oppressed Kurdish population,” said Ranj Aladdin, senior fellow at the Middle East Council on Global Affairs. “But her brutal death has come to symbolise something much bigger than the Kurdish cause in Iran that strikes at the very heart of the political and ideological system that underpins the Islamic Republic.“While her name will be exploited by other opponents of the regime, for the first time since 1979 the Kurdish cause in Iran has become intertwined with that of other oppressed communities. What that means for Kurdish human rights in the immediate future remains to be seen, but – if and when the regime survives this uprising – it is the Kurds who will most likely be in the cross-hairs of its violent response.”Rozhin says the aftermath of the demonstrations is not being considered, for now. “Women are struggling so much with so many problems. It’s obvious that people do not only have an issue with the hijab, but the system of government. They have changed the definition of Islam. They are killing many people. They are denying every single right of women. They don’t allow us to choose. It’s not only about the hijab issue – it’s about our right to make choices.”Another woman, a resident of Tehran who refused to be named, said the protests had electrified women across the country. “It’s happening in ways that have never been known before. Even if we don’t win, we’ve already won in many ways. The state cannot ignore us now. Our stance has made them weaker.”Additional reporting by Nechirvan Mando This article was amended on 29 September 2022.

Starlink users are able to bypass a country’s terrestrial communications networks, freeing them from internet censorship.But Musk has said his Starlink requires terminals – dish and router – inside the country – something the Iranian government is unlikely to support, requiring him to take the risk of being sued by Iran in the international courts if he presses ahead without their support.Starlink’s activation in Ukraine earlier this year is not comparable since the Ukrainian government supported his move once its own communication networks were disrupted by Russia’s invasion.The EU is understood to be looking at how it can encourage more software companies to sign the Danish foreign ministry-backed “Copenhagen pledge on tech for democracy”, a statement on how to keep the internet open and free.The ambassadors of the UK and Norway to Iran were also summoned to the Iranian foreign ministry in protest at the two European countries’ stance.The head of the Iranian judiciary has been issuing ever stronger warnings about the punishment that will be meted out to those who took to the streets or supported those who did.Shutting down the internet is another brutal blow against women by the Iranian regime | Azadeh AkbariRead moreIn the US, Republican senators are calling for the US to announce it is withdrawing from the negotiations on the future of the Iran nuclear deal.

33,"An Islamic organisation that says it fights discrimination against minorities in India has disbanded after the government declared it and its affiliates unlawful, accusing them of involvement in terrorism.The government of Narendra Modi’s Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) accused the Popular Front of India (PFI) group of having been involved in “terrorism” and “anti-national activities”.The ban, under a strict anti-terrorism law, came amid a crackdown in which 300 PFI leaders and activists have been arrested.The PFI branch in the southern state of Kerala said that it had worked only “for the socio-economic empowerment of the downtrodden people”.“But as law-abiding citizens of our great country, we accept the home ministry’s decision (to ban the PFI). We also inform all that the PFI has been disbanded,” the statement said.PFI leaders have previously said that the terrorism accusations were baseless.“These cases against us are all fabricated. We are victims of a political vendetta by the BJP-led government,” Anis Ahmed, the general secretary of PFI, said just before he was arrested last week.Muslims, who make up more than 15% of India’s 1.4 billion population, often complain of persecution in the Hindu-majority country, and note that the marginalisation of the community has been increasingly prominent under the BJP. The BJP and the government deny the accusations.Founded in 2006 in Kerala, the PFI claims to fight for the rights of minorities and low-caste Hindus.On its website, the organisation calls itself a movement that aims to establish an “egalitarian society where everyone enjoys freedom, justice and a sense of security”.The PFI supported the protest against a 2019 citizenship law that according to its critics discriminated against Muslims. It also supported this year’s protests in the southern state of Karnataka by Muslim girls who demanded their right to wear hijab in educational institutions.India’s home ministry said in a statement that the organisation had “been found to be involved in serious offences, including terrorism and its financing, targeted gruesome killings, disregarding the constitutional setup of the country”.The PFI “encourages extremism”, “disrupts the communal harmony” and “has ties with the banned groups like Simi [Students Islamic Movement of India] and [Bangladeshi terrorist group] Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh”, a government gazette that declared the ban said.According to the gazette notification, “there is evidence that the group has a connection with the international terrorist group Isis”.PFI leaders rebutted the charge. “There are mainstream media reports describing how our top leaders condemned the Isis. The allegation that this organisation had links with the Isis is ridiculously false,” one Kerala-based leader said on condition of anonymity.“We are confident, all major charges against the PFI and its leaders will be found to be false if the trials in the court are conducted properly.”Security expert Swaran Ram Darapuri, a retired police services officer, said the allegations against PFI seemed to be preconceived as “no related specific charge or crime has been investigated or proved” in the cases.“Only some general allegations have been made against the PFI. The organisation has been accused of being involved in terrorism-related activities, among other charges. Those serious charges should have been thoroughly investigated and proved in a court of law before taking any action like banning the organisation,” said Darapuri, who is also a human rights activist.“The widespread raids and arrests accompanied by diatribes were carried out to malign the organisation. The whole exercise of the crackdown seems to be biased and motivated.”Condemning the ban, the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) – the PFI’s political wing – called it a “direct blow to democracy and human rights”.“Freedom of speech, protests and organisations has been ruthlessly suppressed by the regime against the basic principles of the Indian constitution. The regime is misusing the investigation agencies and laws to silence the opposition and to scare the people from expressing the voice of dissent,” the SDPI statement said.",[{'name': 'Shaikh Azizur Rahman'}],Narendra Modi’s BJP bans Indian Islamic group for ‘terrorist’ links
34,"The body of the renowned US big-mountain skier Hilaree Nelson was found on Wednesday morning after she fell down a narrow 5,000ft slope during a trek in the Himalayas two days earlier.Nelson and her partner, Jim Morrison, had scaled the 26,781ft peak of Manaslu on Monday morning. They reached the summit at 10.42am “in tough conditions”, Morrison wrote in an Instagram post on Wednesday. The pair transitioned from climbing to skiing down to regroup with their sherpa team.“I skied first, and after a few turns Hilaree followed, and started a small avalanche. She was swept off her feet and carried down a narrow snow slope down the south side (opposite from climbing route) of the mountain over 5,000 [feet],” Morrison wrote. “I did everything I could to locate her, but was unable to go down that face as I hoped to find her alive and live my life with her.“I spent the last two days searching from the air in a helicopter.”Morrison wrote that he and a rescue team landed at 22,000ft and found her body on Wednesday morning.Nelson, 49, who has two children, is one of the highest-profile mountaineers, with a career spanning two decades. North Face described her as “the most prolific ski mountaineer of her generation” on its website.In 2012, she became the first woman to climb both the summit of Everest and the peak of adjacent mountain Lhotse within 24 hours.In 2018, the resident of Telluride, Colorado, was awarded the National Geographic Adventurer of the Year award after making the first ski down Lhotse that year.“There are no words to describe the love for this woman, my life partner, my lover, my best friend, and my mountain partner,” Morrison wrote. “My loss is indescribable and I am focused on her children and their steps forward.”Friends of Nelson told National Geographic that in addition to being an accomplished athlete, Nelson was known for her grit and grace in the face of challenges.“She had heroic strengths – not only in mountains, but in her community, and her family,” climber and videographer Renan Ozturk, a friend of Nelson’s, told National Geographic. “The resilience she had to be out of her comfort zone and laugh in the face of dire situations speaks to her positivity.”Conditions on Manaslu were harsh in the days before Nelson and Morrison ascended to the mountain’s peak. On Instagram last week, Nelson expressed doubt that they would end up making it to the summit as heavy rain and humidity was making climbing difficult.“I haven’t felt as sure-footed on Manaslu as I have on past adventures into the thin atmosphere of the high Himalaya,” she wrote. “These past weeks have tested my resilience in new ways.”Also on Monday, a separate avalanche in a lower portion of the mountain killed one climber and injured a dozen others.Manaslu, the eighth-tallest mountain in the world, has seen a busy climbing season in its high peaks.

36,"Hazardous weather has killed at least 36 people in northern India over the past 24 hours, including 12 who were struck by lightning, officials said.Across the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, at least 24 people died after their homes collapsed amid unrelenting rains, relief commissioner Shri Ranvir Prasad said.Mohamed Usman, 15, was on his friend’s roof in the city of Prayagraj when lightning struck on Friday evening, killing him instantly. His friend Aznan was injured and is being treated in a hospital.“As soon as they set foot on the roof, they were hit by lightning and my son died,” said Mohammad Ayub, Usman’s father.Officials said 39 people had been killed by lightning in the past five days, prompting authorities to issue new guidelines advising people how to protect themselves during a thunderstorm.Lightning strikes are common during India’s monsoon season, which runs from June to September.Col Sanjay Srivastava, whose organisation Lightning Resilient India Campaign works with the Indian Meteorological Department, said deforestation, pollution and the depletion of bodies of water all contributed to climate breakdown, which was leading to more lightning.Global heating had increased the frequency of lightning, said Sunita Narain, director general at the Center for Science and Environment. A 1C rise in temperature increases lightning by 12 times.There has been a 34% rise in lightning strikes across India over the past year, which has caused deaths to jump. India recorded 1,489 deaths due to lightning in 2016, compared with 2,869 in 2021, said Srivastava.",[{'name': 'Associated Press in Lucknow'}],Lightning and heavy rains kill 36 in northern India in one day
37,"Workers and activists have been campaigning to push Levi’s, one of the world’s largest clothing brands, to sign on to an international accord for workers’ health and safety in Bangladesh and Pakistan.On 24 April 2013, the Rana Plaza building in Dhaka, Bangladesh, which housed five garment clothing factories, collapsed, killing 1,134 people and injuring approximately 2,500, in the deadliest disaster in the garment industry’s history.In the wake of the incident, fashion brands signed on to an international accord that legally bound them to pay for safety inspections in the Bangladeshi garment industry, which is the second largest exporter of clothing in the world, behind China. But since 2013, numerous top clothing brands have held out on signing on to the accord and subsequent extensions. In 2021, an expanded international accord was developed to include more safety and worker health provisions beyond fire, electrical and structural inspections and repairs of factories. It covers garment factories in Pakistan as well as Bangladesh.The worker health and safety provisions include covering complaints of excessive overtime, lack of maternity leave, regular breaks, access to clean water and bathrooms, and workplace accidents such as heat exhaustion and injuries. It also provides a worker complaint mechanism where employees can confidentially report violations and bind signatories to supporting the complaint process.The garment sector accounts for 84% of Bangladesh’s exports, yet workers still face a dearth of safety protections. Photograph: Mustasinur Rahman Alvi/Eyepix Group/Rex/ShutterstockOver 170 fashion brands have signed on to the accord, including Adidas, American Eagle, Fruit of the Loom, H&M, Zara, Hugo Boss, Puma, Primark, and PVH which owns the brands Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger.The US-based non-profit Remake, in partnership with the Sommilito Garments Sramik Federation, which represents 70,000 female garment workers in Bangladesh, the Labour Education Foundation in Pakistan, the US-based Service Employees International Union affiliate Workers United and Netherlands-based Clean Clothes Campaign, which includes 235 worker organizations, have formed a partnership to pressure Levi’s to sign on to the accord.Private auditing programs ... [have] not been effective.“The newly expanded international accord looks beyond building safety. So it is really a lifeline and a way for workers to share any wellbeing or workplace concerns,” said Ayesha Barenblat, founder and CEO of Remake.She explained workers had singled out Levi’s due to its sizable presence in Pakistan and Bangladesh, which has more than 20 factories. “We abjectly push back on the alleged effectiveness of Levi’s own safety program. The reason being that garment workers themselves have said – through Covid-19 [and] against the backdrop of the economic slowdown – their lives, and their wellbeing have simply been threatened and they do not have a direct line to the brands,” Barenblat said.She added: “The accord gives workers an equal seat at the table. Private auditing programs do not do that and they have simply, in the last 30 years, not been effective.”Bangladeshi garment workers complain about inadequate safety measures and a lack of access to water and medical care. Photograph: Mustasinur Rahman Alvi/Eyepix Group/Rex/ShutterstockAs part of the campaign, activists have delivered letters, sent hundreds of emails to the Levi’s board of directors, and held actions at Levi’s stores earlier this month in Chicago, Philadelphia, Washington DC, London, Delhi, Bengaluru, Dhaka and several other cities.In testimonies provided anonymously for fear of retaliation, workers in Bangladesh who make clothing for Levi’s raised issues such as heat exhaustion, abuse from managers and forced overtime.“We do not have much in terms of safety measures. We are not given machine guards. We do not have access to clean or cold water. It is so hot but we still have to drink hot water. People often faint due to the heat. We have no access to medical care,” said a machine operator who makes clothing for Levi’s and other brands.They added: “We are made to work forced overtime. If there is no overtime available we are forced to work from one to one and a half hours unpaid. Our supervisors and managers treat us very badly. They verbally assault us. If we protest or push back, we are told we will be fired.”The groups have also accused Levi’s of free-riding off the accord by using factories that are covered under the accord without signing on to it, as brands compensate for the safety inspections and oversight of the factories through the accord.Levi’s denied and disputed all complaints from the campaign and allegations of worker safety and health issues, citing several internal programs and efforts. A Levi’s spokesperson characterized the campaign as a social media engagement ploy.A spokesperson for Levi’s said in an email: “We agree with the intent and the spirit of the international accord and applaud the progress it has made. But it is not the only way to support workers in Bangladesh or anywhere else. We believe our programs, with their checks and balances, help us go further and give us greater agility to implement new learnings and expand our systems in other countries (which we are actively doing).”They added: “Recognizing that there is always room for improvement, we continue to augment and expand our programs, and when we hear of facilities that are not where they should be or workers reporting grievances, we investigate those instances, mandate that our suppliers address any issues that are found, and track their progress closely to ensure compliance.”",[{'name': 'Michael Sainato'}],‘Give workers an equal seat’: pressure builds for Levi’s to protect factory employees
38,"Thérèse Coffey is ditching the government’s long-promised white paper on health inequalities, despite the 19-year gap in life expectancy between rich and poor, the Guardian has been told.The health secretary has decided to not publish a document that was due to set out plans to address the stark inequalities in health that the Covid-19 pandemic exposed.It was meant to appear by last spring and be a key part of then prime minister Boris Johnson’s declared mission to level up Britain. It was due to set out “bold action” to narrow the wide inequalities in health outcomes that exist between deprived and well-off areas, between white and BAME populations, and between the north and south of England.“It’s dead. It’s never going to appear. The white paper is being canned,” said one source familiar with the situation.A second source with knowledge of Coffey’s intentions said: “The disparities paper is toast. My understanding of why they’ve pulled it is [that it’s] ideological — the white paper is an affront to this government’s view of what makes for health.”Health experts reacted with dismay to the white paper being scrapped. “We expect the government to keep its commitment to addressing health disparities in an upcoming white paper and would have grave concerns if this long-planned paper were delayed or shelved,” said Dr Habib Naqvi, director of the NHS Race and Health Observatory.“We need to see priorities and an action plan set out to address a number of serious and longstanding health inequalities. This should be a priority, particularly given the cost of living crisis and the impact this is having on diverse communities.”Coffey’s decision follows the Truss government’s decision to review, with a view to scrapping, existing and planned measures to tackle the obesity crisis, such as banning buy-one-get-one-free offers and adverts for junk food being shown on TV before 9pm. That plan has sparked a huge backlash, with ex-Conservative leader William Hague, dozens of health organisations and 26 former health ministers all publicly criticising it as unwise and dangerous.Sajid Javid, the then health secretary, told MPs on 2 February that he would publish “in spring 2022” a white paper on “health disparities”. It would tackle “unacceptable disparities in health outcomes” and help to “break the link between people’s background and their prospect for a healthy life”.However, almost eight months on, it has still not appeared. Coffey’s Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) has no plans to publish it, contradicting repeated pledges by Javid that it would do so. In May he said it would appear “shortly” and would address problems that have been “neglected for too long”, such as the shortage of GPs working in poor areas.In June he said the white paper was an important part of his “vision for the year ahead”. However, he and then chancellor Rishi Sunak resigned from the cabinet on 5 July, in a move that set in train a series of events that led to Boris Johnson resigning as prime minister and being succeeded by Liz Truss, who has also made Coffey deputy prime minister.Sign up to First ThingFree daily newsletterStart the day with the top stories from the US, plus the day’s must-reads from across the GuardianPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, it was a notable omission in Coffey’s new 14-page Our Plan for Patients plan to improve the NHS, which she unveiled last week.“Health is inextricably linked to income, housing, education, employment and our environment, and while these issues can all be partly tackled through local interventions, we need sustained national policy action that is joined up across all government departments to really level up Britain’s health,” said Jim McManus, president of the Association of Directors of Public Health.William Roberts, the chief executive of the Royal Society for Public Health, said: “It is incredibly disappointing to hear that the disparities white paper is being scrapped. This was a clear opportunity to tackle the vast inequalities and disparities that we currently face. Disparities have continued to increase over the last two years and are only set worsen with the cost-of-living crisis. To address this now is essential if we are to build back the nation’s health and wealth to help rebuild our economy.” The DHSC has been approached for comment.",[{'name': 'Denis Campbell Health policy editor'}],Thérèse Coffey scraps promised paper on health inequality
39,"Vaping is substantially less harmful than smoking, according to a major review of nicotine products, but action is needed to tackle the sharp rise in e-cigarette use among children.Researchers at King’s College London said smokers who switched to vaping would experience a “substantial reduction” in their exposure to toxic substances that cause cancer, lung and cardiovascular disease, but they strongly urged non-smokers not to take up either habit.Ann McNeill, a professor of tobacco addiction at King’s and lead author on the study, said smoking was “uniquely deadly”, killing half of all regular, long-term smokers, but that a survey in England found two-thirds of adult smokers were unaware vaping was less harmful.“Vaping poses only a small fraction of the risks of smoking in the short to medium term, however, this does not mean vaping is risk-free, particularly for people who have never smoked,” she said.‘When I see kids vaping, I warn them: that’s what killed my daughter’Read moreDr Debbie Robson, a co-author of the report, said helping people switch from smoking to vaping must become a government priority to achieve the goal of a smoke-free England by 2030.The independent report, commissioned by the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities, in the Department of Health and Social Care, is the most comprehensive review of the health risks of vaping to date. The researchers drew on more than 400 published studies from around the world, many of which looked at signs of harm or levels of toxic substances in the body after smoking and vaping.Most studies reported short- or medium-term effects from smoking or vaping, such as raised levels of nicotine and specific cancer-causing compounds, meaning the scientists gained little insight into potentially more serious long-term health effects that arise after years of using the products.While two-thirds of adult smokers in England believe vaping is as harmful or more harmful than smoking, the report found that levels of toxic substances, such as nitrosamines, carbon monoxide and volatile organic compounds, were the same or lower in vapers compared with smokers. Levels were lower still in people who did not use any nicotine products.Among adults in England, smoking has fallen as vaping has increased, but the same trend is not playing out among younger people. According to the report, smoking among 11- to 18-year-olds stood at 6.3% in 2019 and 6% in 2022, while vaping rose from 4.8% to 8.6%. In the past year, rates of vaping have doubled among 16- to 18-year-olds, but the most striking rise was in newer, disposable vapes, which are now used by more than half of young vapers, up from 7.8% last year.It is illegal to sell vapes to under-18s, but secondary schools have reported a surge in vaping among pupils, largely driven by disposable vapes that can cost £5 each and come in flavours such as gummy bears, cotton candy, waffles and doughnut.The authors called for better law enforcement to prevent shopkeepers and other suppliers selling vapes to children, and for beefed up regulations to tackle the “dramatic increase” in young people using disposablevapes.Sign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterArchie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morningPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For those taking A-levels, these will be the first formal exams they sit. It is right that this is recognised and steps are taken to ensure the cohort is not disadvantaged as a result of their experiences.”National exams including A-levels, GCSEs and BTECs were abandoned by the government in 2020 and 2021, with grades awarded using a more generous system of local assessment that led to record levels of top grades.Jo Saxton, Ofqual’s chief regulator, said: “We expect that overall results in 2023 will be much closer to pre-pandemic years than results since 2020. This decision means that results in 2023 will be lower than in 2022.”The government had previously announced that grading would return to pre-pandemic levels through a two-year process, with exams in summer 2022 to be graded midway between those of 2019 and those assessed by teachers in 2021.But Saxton said senior examiners would make adjustments if next year’s exam performance was “a little lower” when compared with students who sat exams before the pandemic.“Broadly speaking … a typical student who would have achieved an A grade in their A-level geography before the pandemic will be just as likely to get an A next summer, even if their performance in the assessments is a little weaker in 2023 than it would have been before the pandemic,” Saxton said.Sign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterArchie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morningPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

41,"An immersive Matrix films-themed dance, music and visual effects experience directed by Danny Boyle is to be the opening production at one of Europe’s most anticipated cultural venues.The £186m Factory International in Manchester will, its supporters say, be like no other arts venue.Designed by Ellen van Loon, a partner at Rem Koolhaas’s Office for Metropolitan Architecture (OMA) practice, the Factory, which from one angle resembles a spaceship, has been built on the site of the former Granada television studios.It will have an industrial warehouse vibe to it, with super-sized movable walls allowing for different configurations, and everything from intimate performances to events on a grander, more eye-popping scale.The Boyle production will, they predict, be at the blockbuster end of things. It will feature “spectacular visual effects, a cast of professional dancers and hundreds of Manchester participants” coming together to recreate scenes from the Matrix films “provoking visions of an alternative future”.The Factory has been built on the site of the former Granada television studios.Boyle did not want to reveal too many details when talking about it on Thursday. But he did say: “You know what it’s like, especially at the moment, you think: what the fuck is going on? This is a project where we try to address that … through dance, really. That’s not giving too much away but it does reveal some of the ambition of it.”Boyle said community involvement was a key part of it but not in an “am-dram” way – it would be “pushing people to the highest level of performance”.The production is called Free Your Mind and will be the building’s official opening event in October 2023. It will feature choreography by Kenrick “H20” Sandy, music by Michael “Mikey J” Asante, stage sculptures by the designer Es Devlin and work by the poet and playwright Sabrina Mahfouz.It was in 2014 that details of a plan for a large-scale, “ultra-flexible” arts venue in Manchester first emerged. Supporters said it would combine the qualities of the London Coliseum and Tate Modern and would be like nowhere else.The then chancellor, George Osborne, pledged £78m towards its capital costs, revealing during his budget speech that it would be named after Tony Wilson’s Factory Records. “Anyone who is a child of the 80s will think that is a great idea,” he said.With money from Manchester city council and Arts Council England as well, the Factory is the largest investment in a UK cultural project since the opening of Tate Modern in 2000.The Factory will be programmed and operated by the Manchester international festival, and before the formal opening it will be part of the 2023 festival by staging a Yayoi Kusama show in July and August.Yayoi Kusama with her Dots Obsession at the Watari Museum of Contemporary Art in Tokyo.

Devlin said it felt like London’s Royal Festival Hall smashed into Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall.McGrath said he and his team were not daunted by having to programme so much new work, week in, week out, for such a large building. “We take artists on site quite a lot now,” he said. “I have never had an easier sell to artists in my life. Even people we had to work to get here, they were a bit reluctant. They walk in and they are like, ‘sign me up’. We could programme through to the end of the decade quite quickly.”McGrath estimates the venue will stage about 80 gigs a year. After Free Your Mind, there will be a nine-day programme of events – entitled The Welcome – developed by residents of Greater Manchester. It will be art, music, circus and fashion, with the possibility of spoken word poetry in the venue’s gender-neutral toilets.The director of Tate, Maria Balshaw, is among the Factory’s supporters. She said she had never seen a space like it. “I don’t know of another one in the world.

42,"Ministers “need to be honest with the public” that services will stop or be scaled back, the head of the union representing senior civil servants has said, amid fears a new era of austerity is about to be unleashed.Concern was expressed by trade unions representing public sector workers in response to reports that departments are being asked to draw up plans for cuts aimed at reducing government borrowing as a result of the crisis sparked by Kwasi Kwarteng’s mini-budget.Civil service departments were already delivering an average of 5% efficiency savings agreed as part of a review last year yet it now appeared the government was asking for those plans to be ripped up “in a state of panic”, said Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA union, which represents senior civil servants.‘A reverse Robin Hood’: key exchanges from Liz Truss’s radio interviewsRead more“If the government refuses to compensate public services for soaring inflation, or even cut their budgets back further, they need to be honest with the public,” he said. “Services are going to stop or be scaled back and the government needs to be accountable for those decisions.”The Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS), the largest representing civil servants in the UK, said that cuts “would make waiting lists longer for those seeking passports and driving licences, make telephone queues longer for those with tax enquiries”.The PCS general secretary, Mark Serwotka, added: “When a government minister says ‘efficiency savings’, everyone knows they mean ‘job cuts and privatisation’, and we’re very clear there’s no scope for either in the civil service.”Calling for a general election, Unison’s general secretary, Christina McAnea, said: “Ministers must listen to the world’s economic experts urging them to junk this disastrous financial experiment. Suggestions that benefits won’t rise with soaring inflation and beleaguered public services are to be squeezed is a terrifying prospect.“The government ​seems to have no idea of the damage its foolhardy approach is wreaking. Essential services need support and investment so they can hold on to experienced staff and deliver for the public, not cuts that will harm communities irreparably.”Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the ASCL was extremely concerned about the “bleak prospects” for the UK economy after the mini-budget. “There are many implications but one of the most worrying is that this will lead to a new era of austerity for public services, including education,” he said.“This comes after a decade in which school and college funding has significantly fallen in real-terms, forcing cutbacks in educational provision, because of the last age of austerity.”Another union representing civil servants, Prospect, called on Liz Truss to change course and stop what it described as an “irresponsible plan which is tanking the economy”.Mike Clancy, Prospect’s general secretary, said: “While ministers spent the entire summer fiddling as they picked a new PM, dedicated civil servants and other public sector workers kept the country running.”Truss promised during the Tory leadership election that she was “not planning public spending reductions”. But Sky News reported on Wednesday that the Treasury was expected to send out a letter to secretaries of state insisting that departments find savings.The union reaction came as the prime minister told BBC Radio Leeds that the government’s tax-cutting measures were the “right plan” in the face of rising energy bills and to get the economy growing and deal with inflation, despite market turmoil sparked by the chancellor’s mini-budget.

43,"US mortgage rates rose this week for the sixth straight week, marking new highs not seen in 15 years, before a crash in the housing market triggered the Great Recession.Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac reported on Thursday that the average on the key 30-year rate climbed to 6.7% from 6.29% last week. By contrast, the rate stood at 3.01% a year ago.The average rate on 15-year, fixed-rate mortgages, popular among those looking to refinance their homes, jumped to 5.96% from 5.44% last week.Rapidly rising mortgage rates threaten to sideline even more homebuyers after more than doubling in 2022. Last year, prospective homebuyers were looking at rates well below 3%.Freddie Mac noted that for a typical mortgage amount, a borrower who locked in at the higher end of the range of weekly rates over the past year would pay several hundred dollars more than a borrower who locked in at the lower end of the range.Last week, the Federal Reserve bumped up its benchmark borrowing rate by another three-quarters of a point in an effort to constrain the economy, its fifth increase this year and third consecutive 0.75 percentage point increase.Perhaps nowhere else is the effect of the Fed’s action more apparent than the housing sector.

44,"The NAACP filed a federal complaint on Tuesday accusing Mississippi state officials of violating civil rights law by repeatedly diverting federal funds meant for ensuring safe drinking water away from the state’s predominantly – Black capital, Jackson, to smaller, white communities.Their actions amounted to racial discrimination and a devastating loss of access to drinking water for more than a month for residents in Jackson, where more than 80% of residents are Black and a quarter are in poverty.“The result is persistently unsafe and unreliable drinking water and massive gaps in the access to safe drinking water that are intolerable in any modern society,” Jackson residents allege in the complaint. “Nearly all of the residents of Jackson have watched brackish, dirty, impure, and undrinkable water trickle from their taps. At times, some have had no water at all.”The complaint, filed to the Environmental Protection Agency, amplifies pressure on officials in Mississippi and Jackson to address longstanding water infrastructure woes that recently forced Jackson to shut down its water supply in late August and maintain a boil water notice for weeks.Last week, a group of Jackson residents also filed a federal class-action lawsuit against current and former city and state officials as well as an engineering firm seeking monetary damages for neglect by officials.The NAACP’s complaint to the EPA, which has 25 days to decide whether to investigate it, notes that Jackson’s leaders have “repeatedly requested” aid from officials in the Republican-controlled state to “provide funding solutions”. Instead, “Jackson’s majority-Black population has been repeatedly ignored, spurned, or ridiculed,” the complaint states.In the last 25 years, the city has received federal funds toward addressing safe drinking water just three times. At the same time, since 2016, the city has imposed more than 750 notices for residents to boil their water, roughly 40% of which came in the last two years.Derrick Johnson, president of the NAACP and a Jackson resident, blamed “racist funding policies” by Governor Tate Reeves, a Republican, and state officials that prevented critical and preventive infrastructure from being built. Johnson described in the complaint how he and his family often used boiled and bottled water even when the city wasn’t under an advisory notice because he “cannot entrust his family’s health to the crumbling water system”.The city, where more than 80% of residents are Black and a quarter are in poverty, depends on federal funding in part because it has suffered from a shrinking tax base since white residents fled the area in the decade following the integration of public schools. Since Mississippi is one of 49 states where the EPA allows the state to decide how water systems are funded, it leaves the authority over whether those funds are equally distributed up to the state. The EPA’s inspector general announced in mid-September that it would investigate Jackson’s “drinking water emergency”, Politico reported.The complaint notes that state officials have exacerbated the funding gap by repeatedly denying Jackson the ability to fund improvements to its drinking water system. In March 2021, when, after a previous water shutdown, Jackson’s mayor, Chokwe Lumumba, requested $47m in emergency aid, and the state legislature approved just $3m .“The people of Jackson, Mississippi, have lacked access to safe and reliable water for decades,” the EPA administrator, Michael Regen, who visited the city on Monday and met with the city’s mayor, said in a statement. “These conditions are unacceptable in the United States of America.”In the past decade, such conditions have become part of the disparate plight of communities of color in other cities like Flint, Michigan, and Newark, New Jersey, where lead-ridden water has plagued ailing water infrastructure systems. Abre’ Conner, director of environmental and climate justice for the NAACP, said that the mishandling of Jackson’s water crisis is part of a “longstanding history of mistreating, and neglecting Black communities, putting the lives of men, women, and children at risk.“As our infrastructure continues to age and the effects of climate change worsen, we will continue to experience crises such as the one in Jackson, not only in Mississippi but in predominantly Black communities throughout the country,” she said in a statement.",[{'name': 'Edwin Rios'}],NAACP files racial discrimination complaint over Jackson water crisis

But Thomas did tell reporters she was looking forward to answering questions from the members of the committee.Testimony from Thomas was one of the remaining items for the committee as it nears completion of its work. The panel has interviewed more than 1,000 witnesses and shown some testimony in eight public hearings.Thomas’s attorney, Mark Paoletta, said last week Thomas was “eager to answer the committee’s questions to clear up any misconceptions about her work relating to the 2020 election”.The extent of her involvement in the Capitol attack is unclear. In the days after the presidential election was called for Biden, Thomas emailed two lawmakers in Arizona to urge them to choose “a clean slate of electors” and “stand strong in the face of political and media pressure”.The AP obtained the emails earlier this year under the state’s open records law.Thomas has said in interviews she attended a pro-Trump rally near the White House on the morning of 6 January 2021 but left before Trump spoke and crowds attacked the Capitol.Thomas has repeatedly maintained that her political activities posed no conflict of interest with the work of her husband.“Like so many married couples, we share many of the same ideals, principles and aspirations for America,” Thomas told the Washington Free Beacon in March.“But we have our own separate careers and our own ideas and opinions too. Clarence doesn’t discuss his work with me and I don’t involve him in my work.”Justice Thomas was the lone dissenting voice when the supreme court ruled in January to allow a congressional committee access to presidential diaries, visitor logs, speech drafts and handwritten notes relating to the events of January 6.Ginni Thomas has been openly critical of the committee’s work, including signing a letter to House Republicans calling for the expulsion of Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, for joining the January 6 committee.",[{'name': 'Associated Press in Washington'}],"Ginni Thomas, wife of supreme court justice, appears before January 6 panel"
46,"The “catastrophic” scale of damage wreaked by Hurricane Ian’s 150mph deadly rampage across Florida was beginning to emerge on Thursday as emergency crews rescued trapped residents from flooded homes, and authorities warned of the probability of numerous fatalities.Search and rescue crews moved in at first light to areas of south-west Florida that were submerged by a storm surge of up to 18ft after one of the most powerful storms ever to strike the US swept ashore on Wednesday.Storm Ian’s predicted track. Kevin Anderson, the mayor of Fort Myers, said he knew of “several” fatalities, but was unaware of their circumstances.In coastal south-west Florida, desperate residents posted to social media sites, pleading for rescue for themselves or loved ones. Helicopters assisted recovery efforts by coast guard and national guard troops.“Time is of the essence and we’ve got a lot of people we need to help,” Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor, said at a morning press conference.“They’re focusing their rescue efforts on those areas that were most hard hit.”Boats are partially submerged at a marina in the aftermath of Hurricane Ian in Fort Myers, Florida, on Thursday. Photograph: Giorgio Viera/AFP/Getty ImagesThe governor said Ian had caused widespread impacts across the state, with life-threatening flooding from the deluge of three months’ worth of rain in 48 hours in some areas.“The impacts of this storm are historic, and the damage that was done has been historic. And this is just off initial assessment,” he said.“This storm is having broad impacts across the state, and some of the flooding you’re going to see in areas hundreds of miles from where this made landfall are going to set records.”Joe Biden made a major disaster declaration for nine of the worst-affected counties, freeing federal resources to supplement local rescue and recovery efforts, and guaranteeing government money for an initial 30-day period for costs likely to run into billions of dollars.As Ian weakened into a tropical storm and prepared to exit Florida’s east coast on Thursday, more than 2 million people in the state remained without power, and could be for weeks, DeSantis said, adding that power grids would need to be completely rebuilt in some areas.Residents from Punta Gorda on the south-west coast to Orlando and Cape Canaveral assessed the damage from unprecedented flooding and the storm’s punishing winds.“I don’t think that we can quantify it yet. But I can tell you that it is going to be catastrophic,” said Deanne Criswell, administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), to CNN.“The amount of impact to these communities is going to be significant. When we look at these large population centers that have had significant impacts to their homes, we know a number of these families are living in mobile homes, which have a very hard time with standing storms as strong as Ian.“We are preparing for the potential of thousands of families that are going to need assistance as they assess their own damage and get on their road to recovery.”A section of the causeway leading to Sanibel, Florida in Lee county was knocked out by Hurricane Ian on Thursday. Photograph: Douglas R Clifford/APIn Lee county, officials were attempting to calculate a death toll. Sheriff Carmine Marceno walked back his earlier claim of “hundreds”, but said he feared what rescue crews would find.“There are people I know did not evacuate,” he told CNN. “They tried to take cover, they’ve gone to the second floor and the attic [but] the water got so high here with a surge of approximately 16ft give or take, that’s what’s going to compromise structures and also that’s the most deadly.”Anderson, the Fort Myers mayor, said rescue operations were ongoing and it was too soon for an accurate figure. “I just know there are several deaths related to the storm,” he said.In Deltona, a 72-year-old man fell into a canal while using a hose to drain his pool in heavy rain and drowned, the Volusia county sheriff’s office said.The storm surge flooded the lower-level emergency room of the HCA Florida Fawcett hospital in Port Charlotte, while fierce winds tore part of the fourth-floor roof from its intensive care unit, according to Dr Birgit Bodine.Intensive care staff were forced to evacuate the medium-sized hospital’s sickest patients to other floors.Bodine said incoming storm injuries could make things worse. “The ambulances may be coming soon and we don’t know where to put them in the hospital at this point,” she said. “We’re doubled and tripled up.”Elsewhere, a 65ft section of a causeway connecting mainland Fort Myers to Sanibel and Captiva islands collapsed.“We are beginning to get a sense that our community has been, in some respects, decimated,” said the Lee county manager, Roger Desjarlais.Meanwhile, the governors of Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia declared states of emergency as they prepared for the probability of Ian restrengthening before making a second landfall.The National Hurricane Center in Miami predicted on Thursday that its path would take it into the Atlantic later today and curve back towards the south-east US coast by Friday afternoon as a strong tropical storm or possible hurricane.“Widespread, life-threatening catastrophic flooding, with major to record river flooding, will continue today across portions of central Florida with considerable flooding in northern Florida, south-eastern Georgia and eastern South Carolina through the end of the week,” the NHC said in its morning advisory.The Associated Press contributed to this report",[{'name': 'Richard Luscombe in Miami'}],Hurricane Ian: Florida rescue crews search for residents trapped by floods
47,"Multiple failures by the NHS 111 telephone advice service early in the pandemic left Covid patients struggling to get care and led directly to some people dying, an investigation has found.The Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch (HSIB) looked into the help that NHS 111 gave people with Covid in the weeks before and after the UK entered its first lockdown on 23 March 2020.It identified a series of weaknesses with the helpline, including misjudgment of how seriously ill some people with Covid were, a failure to tell some people to seek urgent help, and a lack of capacity to deal with a sudden spike in calls.It also raised concerns that the government’s advice to citizens to “stay at home” to protect NHS services deterred people who needed immediate medical attention from seeking it from GPs and hospitals, sometimes with fatal consequences.HSIB’s investigation was prompted by a series of reports in the Guardian in 2020 about inadequacies in how 111 operated in the initial weeks of the pandemic, and claims by the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice that many callers with Covid received inadequate advice and died after being wrongly told to stay at home.HSIB’s 15-month investigation uncovered an array of flaws, including some key failings involving the Coronavirus Response Service (CRS), a telephone triage service set up on 5 March 2020 to which 111 call handlers were to transfer queries from anyone concerned about the virus.Mistakes identified by HSIB included that:
The CRS algorithm did not allow for the assessment of any life-threatening illness a caller had – such as obesity, cancer or lung disease – to establish if they should undergo a clinical assessment.
When “many” callers reached the core 111 service, there was no way to divert them as intended to the CRS, which was operationally independent of 111.
Although patients who had symptoms of Covid-19 as well underlying health conditions, including diabetes, were meant to be assessed when they spoke to the core 111 service, “some” were not.
The number of extra calls to 111 in March 2020 meant only half were answered.
To illustrate its findings, HSIB published four short anonymised accounts provided to them by the families of deceased Covid patients’ families about their experience of 111 early in the pandemic. All four were advised to stay at home, did not receive in-person medical help until they were gravely ill, and later died. In one case, calls from a sick man and his relatives went unanswered. In another, a man – a 45-year-old doctor – was misdiagnosed as having a chest infection, prescribed an inhaler and antibiotics, and died 16 days after being admitted to hospital.Of the advice to “stay at home” and call 111, which was widely promoted at the time, HSIB concluded: “The decision to redirect the public to call NHS 111 rather than access healthcare advice in other ways, for example through their GP, shifted the immediate burden of managing patients with Covid-19 in the community. This increased capacity, in the wider healthcare system, but risked disrupting continuity of care for patients with complex health needs.”The Department of Health and Social Care declined to comment on that advice.Rachel Power, the chief executive of the Patients Association, said: “While we appreciate that NHS 111 was working under new and very challenging circumstances, and knowledge of the effects of Covid-19 was in its infancy, the report … supports our own calls for the NHS to improve and standardise the level of service provided by NHS 111 across the country.”Its own research in 2021 found that some 111 users “felt badly let down” by it, she added.NHS England highlighted the “vital role” NHS 111 had played in the response to Covid, fielding 2m calls in March 2020 alone and referring more than 500,000 people for assessment.A spokesperson said: “Call handlers followed guidance set out by Public Health England, which was regularly updated as the understanding of Covid-19 improved, and the NHS has captured learning throughout the last two years to contribute to the response to any future pandemics.”",[{'name': 'Denis Campbell Health policy editor'}],"NHS 111 failures led to early Covid deaths, investigation finds"
48,"Poverty campaigners have said it would be “morally indefensible” for ministers to fund tax cuts for the richest on the backs of the poor, amid speculation ministers may reduce welfare benefits in the wake of last week’s ill-received fiscal statement.Friday’s mini-budget announced billions of tax cuts benefiting high earners, but the subsequent market fallout plunged the UK’s finances to near crisis. The government is expected to have to make tens of billions of pounds of public spending cuts later this year to try to put the UK’s finances on a sound footing.With prime minister Liz Truss having made high-profile political commitments to increase defence and NHS spending, welfare is seen as a prime candidate for cuts.‘A reverse Robin Hood’: key exchanges from Liz Truss’s radio interviewsRead moreIn interviews on Thursday morning the Treasury minister Chris Philp refused to confirm the government would stick to promises made in May by former chancellor Rishi Sunak that benefits would be uprated by the September rate of inflation.Raising benefit rates next April by less than the September rate of CPI inflation – likely to be about 10% – would save billions for the Treasury but would be likely to increase poverty and hardship for low-income families already struggling with the cost of living crisis.The Resolution Foundation thinktank estimated raising benefits in line with earnings – about 5% – rather than inflation would save the government £11bn next year but would leave a couple with two children more than £1,061 a year worse off, and a single parent with one child £607 a year out of pocket.Any cuts would follow a year in which benefits were uprated in April by 3.1% – linked to the September 2021 inflation rate – despite inflation having soared to about 9%. This resulted in the biggest fall in the real value of the basic rate of unemployment benefits in 50 years.“Many people across the UK will agree it is morally indefensible that the prime minister would choose to give tax cuts to the richest funded on the backs of the poorest in our society,” said Iain Porter, senior policy adviser at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation charity.Child Poverty Action Group chief executive Alison Garnham said: “Struggling families will not forgive a chancellor who comes to them for efficiency savings when their cupboards are already bare.”Philippa Stroud, a Tory peer and head of the Legatum Institute thinktank, said hard policy choices made by the government should not be taken on the backs of the poorest. “This is a matter of basic human dignity. We have to take care of the most vulnerable at times of bumpy transitions in society.

The pair were also each fined 70,000 Zimbabwe dollars (£200).A six-month jail term was suspended for the next five years on condition that the two do not commit a similar offence.Dangarembga was arrested in July 2020 for holding a placard inscribed “We want better. Reform our institutions” during a peaceful protest. Human rights organisations including Amnesty and the writers’ association PEN International had called for the charges to be dropped. PEN swiftly condemned the conviction on Thursday and called on the Zimbabwe authorities “to uphold their human rights obligations and desist from persecuting dissenting voices”.The magistrate, Barbara Mateko, said the state had proved beyond doubt that the two had staged a demonstration with the intent to incite violence.Prize-winning Dangarembga protested against the court’s decision and said she will appeal at the high court.“We are in a situation where media freedom is not encouraged and those like myself and Julie, my co-accused, who wish to promote freedom of the media, are found to have committed a crime,” Dangarembga, who was shortlisted for Booker prize in 2020, told journalists outside court.“This means the space for freedom of expression is shrinking and is increasingly criminalised. However, we do intend to appeal the conviction.”She said freedom of expression was under siege in Zimbabwe.“Our role as citizens is being changed into a role that is not an active citizen but a subject.

Authorities said on Thursday that they have rescued a total of nine people who were on the capsized boat, the US coast guard tweeted.On Tuesday, seven people also from Cuba were taken into custody after making it to shore in Pompano Beach, Florida, just north of Fort Lauderdale, CBS News said.Officials used social media to issue a warning about making the dangerous journey by sea, even after Hurricane Ian passes.“Do not risk your life by attempting this journey at sea. Storm surge along with King tide can create treacherous sea conditions even after a storm passes,” they said.Hurricane Ian battered Cuba, killing at least two people and leaving much of the island in total blackout. Millions were already facing daily power interruptions.After making landfall in Florida, one of the most intense storms to make landfall in the US has continued to wreak havoc on hospitals and other essential infrastructure.A hospital in Port Charlotte, Florida, an hour outside Venice, experienced major flooding in its lower-level emergency room and had the roof of its intensive care unit torn off, the Associated Press reported.Medical staff at HCA Florida Fawcett worked quickly on Wednesday to move its most vulnerable patients to other floors, as water flooded the hospital from above and below.The hospital has four floors. Only two remained usable.Dr Birgit Bodine, who was there when the roof came off, said patients had been mostly understanding amid damage from the storm but staff were worried about the potential influx of patients with storm-related injuries.“The ambulances may be coming soon and we don’t know where to put them in the hospital at this point,” Bodine said, noting that patients were “doubled or tripled up” given the lack of space.Bodine added: “For us, as much as everything is terrible and we’re exhausted … as long as our patients do OK and nobody ends up dying or having a bad outcome, that’s what matters.’",[{'name': 'Gloria Oladipo in New York'}],Eighteen Cuban migrants missing after boat sinks during Hurricane Ian
51,"In nearly six months, just 36 people have taken up New Zealand’s offer to resettle refugees held in Australian detention camps such as Nauru, with UN’s refugee agency saying the brutality of Australia’s immigration regime is partly to blame.In March 2022, Australia’s government accepted a longstanding offer from New Zealand to resettle up to 450 refugees from Australia’s regional processing centres over the next three years, at a rate of up to 150 per year. But after nearly six months, uptake has been slow – stymied by the dire mental health of prospective applicants.The UN and NZ Greens say many refugees are so traumatised by their years in prison camps that they lack capacity to apply, or have lost trust in the asylum process.Refugees resettled in New Zealand from Australia to be permanently banned from returningRead moreIn theory, more than 1,200 people could have applied – about 110 refugees and asylum seekers on Nauru, and around 1,100 temporarily brought to Australia. So far, however, 36 people have been submitted by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for resettlement to New Zealand under this arrangement, and, according to the New Zealand government, only 14 have been interviewed.“The mental health impact of what these individuals have experienced over the past nine years has significantly affected their capacity to engage in the resettlement process and has led to a general lack of confidence in the processes,” said Emily Chipman, at the UNHCR for Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific. “Refugees have evoked concerns about leaving family members behind in Australia, and about not being psychologically strong enough to rebuild their lives in a new country after all they have gone through over the past nine years.”Chipman said that of more than 1,100 refugees being held in Australia, less than 14% had expressed interest in resettling in New Zealand. Those still awaiting outcomes on their applications to other countries – such as the US and Canada – cannot be referred to New Zealand. Because of that, less than 9% of those in Nauru are currently eligible.New Zealand immigration minister Michael Wood told reporters on Thursday the low numbers came as fewer people than expected self-nominated to settle in New Zealand. “There’s nothing that we can do to force the people concerned to pursue this pathway,” he said.“The people themselves need to positively identify themselves that they wish to pursue the option of attempting settlement in New Zealand – and so that’s where those numbers come from. That’s the number of people who have identified that option.”Wood said he had “had a number of productive discussions with home affairs minister Clare O’Neil in Australia, who has oversight of the deal from the Australian government’s end, and I think they’re very positively engaged in the process,” he said.The New Zealand Greens refugee spokesperson, MP Golriz Ghahraman, said the delays were partly because many of the refugees concerned are highly traumatised, suffering from major mental health issues, with some sceptical that the offer was real and would not be withdrawn.“There’s a whole lot of people who are really hard to process because of the very severe mental health harms,” Ghahraman said she was told in meetings with UNHCR officials. “They are struggling to get information out of them, or get them to even want to apply,” she said.Home affairs minister Claire O’Neil has been contacted for comment on the reasons for the limited uptake.Ghahraman added that many of the refugees had experienced years of conditions that amounted to torture, citing examples like the case of a 12-year old who was finally evacuated to Australia in a critical condition after refusing all food and medical treatment for more than 20 days. A Médecins Sans Frontières report in 2018 found almost a third of Nauru asylum seeker and refugee patients had attempted suicide, 60% had suicidal thoughts, and 12 patients were diagnosed with the rare disorder resignation syndrome, where they became nonverbal and catatonic.Ghahraman said: “Before people are able to engage with the refugee determination process, they need a high level of mental health care and support, and that should be actively resourced – probably by Australia. Because Australia is the one that’s caused that harm.”Others had already put in applications to resettle to Canada or the US, and were concerned about losing their place on those waitlists if they applied to New Zealand, she said.Of the refugees being processed to check their eligibility for New Zealand’s offer, 16 are in Nauru, of whom 14 have been interviewed . New Zealand is in the process of making immigration decisions for them. The other 16 are in Australia, and have not yet been interviewed to check their eligibility because they have only recently been entered into the process by the UNHCR.Elizabeth Young, an advocate for the Asia Pacific Refugee Rights Network (APRRN), said while she would anticipate the resettlement process could be lengthy, it was “remarkable” that such a small number had been signed up to begin the process. “Why is it taking so long, and what is being done to ostensibly promote this as a good option for people … are people being appropriately supported to apply?”",[{'name': 'Tess McClure in Auckland'}],Australia-New Zealand refugee deal: UN criticises Canberra after just 36 people take up offer
52,"A New Zealand health campaign designed to help curb hepatitis C has hit a stumbling block after one of its advertisements showing people raising the middle finger was deemed too offensive to air.The associate health minister, Ayesha Verrall, launched the “Stick it to Hep C” campaign in July, to raise awareness over the virus, which kills roughly 200 New Zealanders a year.The campaign included videos, outdoor posters and online material featuring actors raising their middle finger to another person, while smiling. The advertisement then goes on to show an actor having his middle finger pricked for a blood test, to determine if he has the blood-borne virus.But the Advertising Standards Authority has upheld a complaint describing the advertising imagery as “deeply offensive”.Adidas sports bra ads banned for being likely to cause widespread offenceRead more“The gesture is long established as ‘sign language’ for a series of very rude words, in short “F*%$ You!”,” the complainant said. “It has no place on a billboard nor where it can be seen by children.”While the complaints board agreed that those watching the advertising were likely to understand that there is “an easy finger prick test to determine if you have been exposed to hepatitis C and a new effective treatment, meaning you can say ‘Fuck you’ to hep C’”, the context would be missing for most people who were “likely to only focus on the hand gesture”.An image from the ad showing a finger-prick test for hepatitis C.

54,"Damning findings of widespread sexism and sexual harassment at Australia’s Antarctic stations have prompted an independent review of workplace culture and complaint handling, after allegations of unwanted physical contact, displays of pornography, and limited provision for women menstruating.The federal environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, said she was “shocked and disappointed” at the findings of a report by a senior adviser in the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD), saying urgent change was needed.“The work the division does is critical: for our national interest, for science and the environment, for the future of this planet. It’s far too important to be tainted and diminished by prejudice and harassment,” Plibersek said.

The report into equity, inclusion and diversity in the Australian Antarctic Program, led by AAD senior adviser and University of Tasmania researcher, Assoc Prof Meredith Nash, published allegations of gender inequality and inappropriate behaviour at stations in Antarctica. Nash’s investigation included reports of unwelcome requests for sex, uninvited physical contact or gestures, displays of offensive or pornographic material, sexist jokes, inappropriate drinking culture, and a homophobic culture on stations.The AAD manages four permanent research stations in Antarctica and the sub-Antarctic. It describes each location as running “like small towns”, with the number of people deployed to each location varying between dozens and more than 100, depending on the time of year, deployed for several months at a time.The Nash inquiry, first reported by the ABC on Friday, made particular note of women in the program being forced to “go to great lengths to make their menstruation invisible”, including “absent or inadequate” support. Reports included women being forced to change menstrual products without privacy or adequate sanitation, having to carry used products in the field with them, improvising menstrual products when no fresh supplies were available, and keeping products in their bodies for longer than recommended due to inadequate toilet stops.It also spoke of “everyday sexism” being “evident in the artefacts on the walls”, a “predatory and objectifying” culture, and “widespread, low-level sexual harassment that permeates stations”.The full report ran to 32 pages, but Plibersek’s office would only publicly release a seven-page summary, citing privacy concerns.Nash recommended widespread action to address gender inequality, including more regular surveys about station culture, diversifying application pools to attract a wider variety of staff, and major reforms to internal culture such as providing free menstrual products, better health training, training around sexual harassment and complaints, and “a major outreach effort to address sexual harassment”.The secretary of the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water, David Fredericks, said in a statement that the report’s findings were unacceptable.“The study by Professor Nash found that women reported experiencing sexual harassment and feeling excluded and diminished while undertaking work in the Australian Antarctic Program, particularly while stationed in the Antarctic,” he wrote.“The report also finds that gender inequality and a broader lack of diversity in AAD are contributing factors. This is disappointing and unacceptable, and I believe requires further action.”Sign up to Guardian Australia's Morning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing email breaks down the key national and international stories of the day and why they matterPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In a judgment handed down on Friday, the court ruled the Northern Territory Aboriginal Sacred Sites Act 1989 did not apply to the director of Parks Australia.The court found an offence within a sacred site could be defended on the basis it was carried out in line with their duties under the federal government or the crown.It also found the director of Parks Australia has “the same legal status as the executive government of the commonwealth in relation to the imposition of criminal liability”, and is generally exempt from prosecution.The director carried out the track realignment works without any certificates, which are required under the Sacred Sites Act, but has since received the approvals.Joe Markham, a traditional owner of the site, told Guardian Australia the decision was “disappointing” and said traditional owners felt “voiceless”.“It’s basically saying that it’s OK to desecrate one of our churches or sacred sites and that there’s nothing to stop them in the future, or anybody else for that matter,” Markham said.“This could have been a mosque or a church … We’ve been done wrong. We didn’t get to tell our story it just came down to a legal matter.”Markham said the area that was within the tracks is extremely significant to the local Jawoyn people as a sacred ceremonial men’s site.“It means [it is an] initiation site for the Jawoyn people and resides on what is the oldest living religion on planet Earth. It’s a focal point for one of our ceremonies,” Markham said.Sophie Creighton, the director of research and land information at the Aboriginal Areas Protection Authority, said the decision was a blow for Aboriginal land rights and cultural protection standards around the country.“We can’t have a situation where there’s uncertainty about whether Aboriginal voices will be listened to when they’re seeking to protect cultural heritage on behalf of all Australians,” Creighton said.Sign up to Guardian Australia's Morning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing email breaks down the key national and international stories of the day and why they matterPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Wong said on Friday that the government was keeping with “tradition” by appointing Smith to represent Australia in the UK.

At the time, however, Rudd branded that claim as “total garbage” and his spokesperson said the former prime minister “won’t be leaving” his current role at the helm of the Asia Society.Wong said the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade would carry out a recruitment process to appoint “experienced public servants as heads of mission in Singapore, New Delhi, Tokyo and at the United Nations in New York” – a list from which ambassador to the US was noticeably absent.All of these positions – except for Tokyo – are currently held by former Liberal politicians.Sign up to Guardian Australia's Morning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing email breaks down the key national and international stories of the day and why they matterPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Vladimir Putin has signed decrees paving the way for the occupied Ukrainian regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia to be formally annexed into Russia. On Friday the Russian president is expected to sign into law the annexations of four Ukrainian regions – Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk and Luhansk – where Russia held fake referendums over the past week in order to claim a mandate for the territorial claims. Thursday night’s decrees, made public by the Kremlin, said Putin had recognised Kherson and Zaporizhzhia as independent territories. This is an intermediary step needed before Putin can go ahead with plans to declare on Friday that they are part of Russia.
The UN secretary general has warned Russia that annexing Ukrainian regions would mark a “dangerous escalation” that would jeopardise the prospects for peace in the region. António Guterres said any decision to proceed with the annexation of the Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions “would have no legal value and deserves to be condemned”.
The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, warned of a “very harsh” response by Ukraine if Russia went ahead with the annexations.
There are indications that Russia might limit the movement of Ukrainians living in the occupied territories after it announces their annexation. Ukrainians have been told that from Saturday they will need to apply for a pass from the occupying authorities. This comes as the exiled Luhansk regional governor, Serhiy Haidai, said Russia had prevented about 1,000 Ukrainians from crossing the border into Latvia.
Russian forces may face “imminent defeat” in the key north-eastern city of Lyman as Ukrainian soldiers continue their counteroffensive in the east of the country, according to a US thinktank. The Institute for the Study of War, citing Russian reports, said the defeat would allow Ukrainian troops to “threaten Russian positions along the western Luhansk” region. Alexander Petrikin, the pro-Russian head of the city administration, admitted the situation had grown “difficult” for Russian forces trying to hold the territory.
Ukrainian forces have secured all of Kupiansk and driven Russian troops from their remaining positions on the east bank of the river that divides the north-eastern Ukrainian city. Most of Kupiansk, a strategic railway junction, was recaptured earlier this month as part of a counteroffensive by Ukrainian troops. AFP reported that those Russian troops who held out on the east bank of the Oskil river have been driven out.
Finland is closing its border to Russian tourists after Putin’s partial mobilisation order prompted large numbers of people to flee the country. From midnight Thursday Finnish time (9pm GMT), Russian tourists holding an EU Schengen visa will be turned away unless they have a family tie or a compelling reason to travel.
More than half of Russians felt fearful or anxious after Putin’s mobilisation announcement, according to a new poll. The poll by the independent Levada Centre showed 47% of respondents said they had felt anxiety, fear or dread after hearing that hundreds of thousands of soldiers would be drafted to fight in Ukraine.
Nato vowed a “determined response” to what it described as “deliberate, reckless and irresponsible acts of sabotage” after leaks were discovered in the two Nord Stream pipelines. Swedish authorities have reported a fourth leak on one of the pipelines. The two leaks in Swedish waters were close to each other.
Gas is likely to stop leaking from the damaged Nord Stream 1 pipeline on Monday, according to the pipeline’s operator. A spokesperson for Nord Stream AG said it was not possible to provide any forecasts for the pipeline’s future operation until the damage had been assessed.
The Kremlin has said incidents on the Nord Stream pipelines look like an “act of terrorism”. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said a foreign state was probably responsible. Russia’s foreign ministry claimed the “incident on the Nord Stream occurred in a zone controlled by American intelligence”.
The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, announced an eighth package of sanctions – including a draft sanctions law seen by the Guardian – designed to “make the Kremlin pay” for the escalation of the war against Ukraine. Hungary “cannot and will not support” energy sanctions in the package, said Gergely Gulyas, chief of staff to the prime minister, Viktor Orbán. An EU official said an agreement on the next sanctions package was expected before next week’s EU summit, or at least major parts of the package.
Russia is escalating its use of Iranian-supplied “kamikaze” drones in southern Ukraine, including against the southern port of Odesa and the nearby city of Mykolaiv.
Oleg Deripaska, one of Russia’s most powerful oligarchs, has been indicted by the US Department of Justice for criminal sanctions violations. Deripaska previously had deep links to British establishment figures.

Revenues grew fastest, up 15% year on year, in the consulting division, which advises businesses on changes such as new technology.However, Deloitte has not escaped scandal. In April the UK’s accounting regulator, the Financial Reporting Council, said it was investigating Deloitte over its audit of the bus and rail operator Go-Ahead over wrongly withholding £50m of taxpayers’ money. The regulator is also investigating Deloitte’s audits of the motoring group Lookers and building materials company SIG.Other big accountancy firms have also enjoyed rapid growth in the past year. Last week EY reported that global revenues rose by almost 14% in the year to June. PwC partners also received an average payout of more than £1m in the same period – albeit one flattered by the sale of another business.The post-pandemic M&A boom has waned dramatically over the course of 2022, with global deals so far worth a third of what they were in 2021 as businesses brace for a possible global recession, according to Dealogic, a data company.Nevertheless, accountancy firms are still looking at growth areas such as increased demand for sustainability reporting, as well as the continued introduction of digital technology.Sign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to the all the business news and analysis you need every morningPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

61,"Vladimir Putin has signed decrees paving the way for the occupied Ukrainian regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia to be formally annexed into Russia.On Friday, the Russian president is expected to sign into law the annexations of four Ukrainian regions – Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk and Luhansk – where Russia held fake referendums over the last week in order to claim a mandate for the territorial claims.Thursday night’s decrees, made public by the Kremlin, said Putin had recognised Kherson and Zaporizhzhia as independent territories. This is an intermediary step needed before Putin can go ahead with plans to unilaterally declare on Friday that they are part of Russia.In February, Putin recognised the independence of the self-proclaimed republics of Donetsk and Luhansk.Putin’s annexation of parts of Ukraine is a critical moment for the world | Alissa de CarbonnelRead moreThe plan to sign treaties on Friday annexing the territories in occupied Ukraine will mark a major escalation of Russia’s seven-month-old war. Putin has said he is ready to defend those territories using all available means, indicating he would be willing to resort to a nuclear strike in order to avert Ukraine’s efforts to liberate its sovereign territory. Putin is seen to be passing a point of no return that will prolong the war and scuttle even the remotest chance of negotiations by obliging Russia to fight in perpetuity for Ukrainian territory, some of which it does not currently control.Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Russia would be annexing itself to a “catastrophe” and vowed that Moscow would get no new territory. “We know how to react to any Russian actions,” the Ukrainian president said on the Telegram messaging app. The Russian government spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said the signing of the “treaties on the accession of territories into the Russian Federation” would take place at 3pm local time in the Kremlin’s St George’s Hall. Putin would deliver a “major” speech at the ceremony.The announcement set off a fresh round of international condemnation. “Any decision to proceed with the annexation of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions of Ukraine would have no legal value and deserves to be condemned,” the UN secretary general, António Guterres, told reporters.MapJoe Biden said that the US would never recognise Russia’s claims on Ukraine’s territory, and denounced the fake referendums as an “absolute sham,” saying, “The results were manufactured in Moscow.”“Putin is raising the stakes,” said Tatiana Stanovaya, a political analyst and founder of R.Politik. “It’s a demonstration that Russia is not ready to negotiate, not ready to make any concessions, and is ready to use any means at its disposal to achieve its strategic goals. Including nuclear weapons. The Russian leadership has said this directly without any hesitation.”‘I will defend the country’: while some Russians flee draft, others head to warRead moreThe territories were not named formally but Kremlin pool reporters said four treaties would be signed, corresponding to the four regions Russia has indicated it plans to annex.Putin is expected to make a speech to members of the State Duma, Russia’s lower house of parliament, at the ceremony. By law, Russia’s Federation Council must approve the treaties before they are signed by Putin but it was not clear when the council was scheduled to meet.Moscow officials have also begun preparing a venue for a major concert near Red Square on Friday evening. “Together forever,” reads a large banner hanging over a stage that also bears the names of the four Ukrainian regions. State television channels are also displaying a countdown to Friday’s event at the Kremlin. Russian soldiers standing on Red Square where a banner on a stage reads: ‘Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson – Russia!’ Photograph: Alexander Nemenov/AFP/Getty ImagesPutin’s decision was believed to be an attempt to halt a Ukrainian counterattack that has forced Russia to retreat from much of the Kharkiv region and is now threatening to retake more territory in Donetsk. He hopes that the threat of all-out war and a nuclear retaliation will reduce western support for the Ukrainian offensive.Ukraine and its supporters have decried Putin’s threats as “nuclear blackmail”. In remarks earlier this week, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, vowed to defend and free Ukrainians in the occupied territories.“This farce in the occupied territory cannot even be called an imitation of referendums,” Zelenskiy said on Tuesday in a video posted on Telegram. “We will act to protect our people: both in the Kherson region, in the Zaporizhzhia region, in the Donbas, in the currently occupied areas of the Kharkiv region, and in the Crimea.”Ukraine’s presidential office said Zelenskiy had spoken to his Polish counterpart, Andrzej Duda, on Thursday about the international reaction to Russia’s illegal referendums. “We discussed specific steps and measures that we will work on in this context, military and defence cooperation,” Zelenskiy wrote on Telegram.The two leaders “agreed on the need for a powerful consolidated world reaction to the illegal actions of the Russian Federation, which destroy the foundations of international law”, the statement from Zelenskiy’s office read. “Specific steps and measures that the parties will work on in this context were discussed.” Zelenskiy also had a call with the outgoing Italian prime minister, Mario Draghi, on Thursday afternoon. According to Zelenskiy’s office, the main topic of their discussion was the need for a firm reaction to the fake referendums.“They are worthless and do not change reality. The territorial integrity of Ukraine will be restored. And our reaction to Russia’s recognition of their results will be very harsh,” Zelenskiy said, according to the statement from his office.Zelenskiy also said he was convening an “urgent” meeting of the national security council on Friday, with details to be announced later. The Kremlin does not have full control over many of the territories it is seeking to annex. It is likely it will lay claim to all four Ukrainian regions in their entirety, including several mid-size cities that are not under Russian control. For instance, in the Zaporizhzhia region, local occupation officials claimed that the recent “referendum” included the entire region, including the city of Zaporizhzhia, which had a prewar population of 750,000. That would mean the Kremlin is obliging the country to fight in perpetuity to defend territories and make advances even while it is on the defensive on the battlefield.The Kremlin may only reveal the details of which territories it is claiming to annex during the signing ceremony. A state budget revealed on Thursday showed that Russia had earmarked 3.3bn roubles ($56.3m or £51.1m) to rebuild the regions. The damage to the city of Mariupol alone was estimated by its mayor at $14bn. The annexation will make the chance of a negotiated settlement to end the war even more remote. Russia amended its constitution in 2022 to forbid ceding territory the country has formally annexed.It was initially seen as a way to prevent a future Russian leader from ceding Crimea, which was annexed in 2014. But the law would also forbid Russia from ceding territories occupied since February or those not currently under Kremlin control.Ekaterina Schulmann, a Russian political scientist, wrote that after annexation, the “Russian Federation as we knew it will pass into a new phase of its existence, having become a state with a delegitimised border, including fragments that not only won’t be recognised by any state or international organisation de jure, but won’t be controlled by its central administration de facto”.",[{'name': 'Andrew Roth in Moscow and Isobel Koshiw in Kyiv'}],Putin signs decrees paving way for annexing Ukraine territories of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia
62,"Liz Truss will attend the inaugural summit of the European Political Community (EPC) next week, an initiative by the EU aimed at uniting the continent to work together on security and other common projects.The prime minister plans to attend the first EPC summit in Prague on 6 October, a No 10 source told the Guardian, despite her scepticism about the EU-led initiative.Truss, a former remainer who became an ardent convert to Brexit, is said to still be sceptical, but willing to engage and keen to ensure the new organisation does not cut across Nato or the G7.She wants the club to focus on issues such as migration and security, rather than creating structures. Some of her aides were also concerned about the optics of joining another European club so soon after Brexit. Liz Truss to hold emergency talks with OBR after failing to calm marketsRead moreProposed by French president Emmanuel Macron in May, the EPC was later endorsed by the EU, which is now organising the event. Macron envisaged a club of European democracies working together on security, but also energy, transport, infrastructure and easier movement across borders for young people. Truss would like the organisation to focus above all on energy, migration and security, topics that are expected to be on the agenda next week.EU officials have invited 27 EU member states and 17 non-EU nations. The non-EU nations include nine countries hoping to join the EU, including Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia and six western Balkan states, as well as Norway and Switzerland, non-members that are deeply integrated into EU structures. Turkey, whose EU membership hopes have long been on ice, has not publicly accepted its invitation, which was issued despite reservations from Greece and Cyprus.The head of the European Council, Charles Michel, told the Guardian earlier this month that it was obvious the UK should be invited, saying: “The United Kingdom is a friend, a partner, a like-minded partner.”EU officials rejected suggestions in some UK media reports that Truss could send her foreign secretary, James Cleverly, in her place, arguing that only heads of government could attend. Michel has said the new organisation should be a flexible structure like the G20, in response to concerns that it could duplicate other bodies, such as the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe.Sign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterArchie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morningPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

63,"Oleg Deripaska, one of Russia’s most powerful oligarchs, who previously had deep links to British establishment figures, has been indicted by the US Department of Justice for criminal sanctions violations.The indictment detailed a number of alleged crimes by the man who was long considered Vladimir Putin’s favourite industrialist, including an elaborate and failed attempt by Deripaska and his associates to shuttle his pregnant girlfriend to the US so that she could give birth there and secure American citizenship for their second child.Merrick Garland, the US attorney general, said the indictment, in the wake of Russia’s “unjust and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine”, showed the US’s commitment to bring to justice those who evade US sanctions and “enable the Russian regime”.The justice department said Deripaska, 55, and three other associates, including one American citizen, had used “lies and deceit to cash in on and benefit from the American way of life”.Deripaska was first subjected to US sanctions in 2018, when he was designated by the US treasury as acting for a senior Russian official. Since then, the indictment alleges, Deripaska evaded those sanctions in a variety of ways, using corporate shell companies to hide his activities. From an Easter gift to an unnamed US television host, to a flower delivery to a former member of the Canadian parliament, to an attempt to shift $3m in proceeds from a US music studio to a Russia-based account, the indictment describes actions that were executed by associates on Deripaska’s behalf.The most elaborate, however, involved Deripaska’s alleged girlfriend, Ekaterina Voronina, 33, who has been charged with making false statements to US agents during one of her attempts to enter the US.The indictment alleges that Deripaska and his associates first arranged for Voronina to travel to the US in 2020 for the purposes of having her give birth to her child with Deripaska in the US.The justice department said Deripaska spent hundreds of thousands of dollars for Voronina to take advantage of the US healthcare system because he did not trust the Russian hospital system, and at one point instructed her to be “careful” when discussing her plans to US agents . Following the birth of their child, who is an American, Deripaska’s associates then conspired to try to conceal Deripaska’s identity as the child’s father, in part by slightly changing the spelling of the child’s last name.When Voronina tried to enter the US again in 2022 to give birth to the couple’s second child, she was denied entry and returned to Istanbul, through which she had flown to enter the US from Russia.One Deripaska associate, a naturalized US citizen named Olga Shriki, was arrested on Thursday morning.The metals magnate has been at the heart of high-profile political fights in the UK, where he was added to the sanctions list by the government this year in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.He previously faced scrutiny after it emerged that Peter Mandelson, who was then trade secretary, had been entertained aboard the oligarch’s “superyacht”, the $65m Queen K, off Corfu. Later it emerged that the Tory shadow chancellor, George Osborne, had also met with the Russian and had invited a Conservative fundraiser to also visit Deripaska on his yacht.Deripaska gained control of vast previously state-owned aluminium assets following the fall of the Soviet Union, which he later consolidated within the Rusal group, in partnership with the former Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich, a fellow sanctions target.Rusal, which was part of Deripaska’s En+ Group, raised $1.5bn with a listing on the London Stock Exchange in 2017.Deripaska and his associates were not immediately available for comment.",[{'name': 'Stephanie Kirchgaessner in Washington'}],US charges Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska with violating sanctions
64,"Arab ambassadors in London are urging Liz Truss not to go ahead with “an illegal and ill-judged” plan to move the British embassy to Jerusalem.Some Arab diplomats have even said the plan could jeopardise talks on a highly prized free trade deal between the UK and the Gulf Cooperation Council due to be completed this year.A private letter was sent before Truss’s trip to the UN in New York, where she confirmed the review, but after the state funeral of Queen.EU allies have told the UK they think the move is unwise and are privately speculating that Truss took the initiative not just due to her close ties with Israel but out of her desire to be noticed as a disruptive force.It was expected that a predictable group of pro-Palestinian countries represented in London would object to the proposed embassy move, but the letter sent by the diplomats has the endorsement of all of the Arab countries, including those that support the Abraham accords signed in September 2020. The accords are designed to lead to a general warming of ties with Israel for its signatories, including Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates.It is understood that some of the Arab states most inclined to the Abraham accords are most disturbed by the move since they fear the accords will be damaged by the claim they opened the way to it.The Guardian view on moving the British embassy to Jerusalem: don’t do it | EditorialRead moreHowever, making a future trade deal contingent on retaining the UK embassy in Tel Aviv may prove a step too far for some more pragmatic Gulf state capitals. It remains to be seen how vocal they will make their objections.In the Tory leadership campaign, Truss announced in a letter to Conservative Friends of Israel that she would open a review of the location of the UK embassy, something she had not done as foreign secretary. She highlighted last week that she was instituting that review in a readout of a bilateral meeting in New York with the Israeli prime minister, Yair Lapid. No details of how the review is being conducted inside the Foreign Office have been made public.One former British diplomat described Truss as a “pound-shop Trump”, a reference to the decision by the US administration under Donald Trump to make the same move in 2018. He said: “She seems to think she should ape Donald Trump. The difference is that the US is big enough to get its way in the Middle East. The UK is not. If the UK shifted its embassy it would have a domino effect amongst some countries in the European Union, such as Hungary, but probably not, and will damage British interest in the Arab world.”Only four other countries have moved their embassy to Jerusalem.Husam Zomlot, the Palestinian ambassador in London, said: “Any embassy move would be a blatant violation of international law and the UK’s historic responsibilities. It undermines the two-state solution and inflames an already volatile situation in Jerusalem, the rest of the occupied territories, and among communities in the UK and worldwide. It would be disastrous.”",[{'name': 'Patrick Wintour Diplomatic editor'}],Arab diplomats urge Liz Truss not to move British embassy to Jerusalem

A source, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue, told Reuters Turnell and the ousted leader had been given “three years each, no hard labour”. Both had pleaded not guilty.Myanmar shadow embassy opens in Canberra to champion Aung San Suu Kyi’s ousted governmentRead moreThe Australian foreign minister, Penny Wong, rejected the court ruling and called for Turnell’s immediate release.“Prof Turnell was tried in a closed court – Australia’s chargé d’affaires and consular officials in Myanmar made every effort to attend the verdict but were denied access to the court,” Wong said. “We will continue to take every opportunity to advocate strongly for Prof Turnell until he has returned to his family in Australia. We acknowledge the strong international support shown for him, including from our region.”There is very limited information about court proceedings involving political prisoners in Myanmar, where more than 15,600 people have been arrested since last year’s coup. Hearings are not accessible to journalists and defence lawyers have been gagged from talking to media.Aung San Suu Kyi had already been sentenced to 20 years in prison over separate cases, and is still facing trials.The military had accused Turnell of possessing confidential documents when he was detained last year, according to the Irrawaddy news site. Turnell has reportedly denied the charge and said the documents were not confidential, but were economic recommendations he had given in his capacity as adviser to Aung San Suu Kyi’s government.The case against him has been widely condemned by rights groups. Aung San Suu Kyi given six extra years in prison on corruption chargesRead moreElaine Pearson, the Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said the sentences handed down were a “cruel injustice”. “The junta’s willingness to pile sentences on Aung San Suu Kyi, along with the Australian economist Sean Turnell and three of her ministers, shows that Myanmar’s military has no qualms about their international pariah status.“Concerned governments should take this as a clear signal that they need to take concerted action against the junta if they are going to turn the human rights situation around in the country,” she said. Turnell had been denied proper access to legal counsel, she added.Turnell has worked on economic and banking issues in Myanmar since the early 2000s, focusing on promoting reform and growth. He has served as special economic consultant to Aung San Suu Kyi and as a senior economic adviser to the minister of planning, finance and industry. Before this, he worked at the Reserve Bank of Australia.Last month, as the UN special envoy to Myanmar, Noeleen Heyzer, met the junta chief, Min Aung Hlaing, to call for a de-escalation in violence in the country, she also conveyed a request from the Australian government appealing for Turnell’s release.Junta-controlled media later published what it claimed was an account of their meeting, in which Min Aung Hlaing said: “With regard to the case of Mr Sean Turnell, should the Australian government take positive steps, we will not need to take stern actions. In the Mr Sean Turnell’s case, the evidence shows that severe penalties could be imposed.”At least 15,683 people have been arrested since the military took power on 1 February 2021, and 12,540 remain in detention, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, which tracks arrests and killings.Other foreign nationals being held include Britain’s former ambassador to Myanmar Vicky Bowman, and Toru Kubota, a Japanese film-maker.Separately, Amnesty International launched a report on Thursday that argued Facebook’s algorithms “substantially contributed” to atrocities committed by the military against Myanmar’s Rohingya minority when Aung San Suu Kyi was in power.“In the months and years leading up to the atrocities, Facebook’s algorithms were intensifying a storm of hatred against the Rohingya which contributed to real-world violence,” said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s secretary general.“While the Myanmar military was committing crimes against humanity against the Rohingya, Meta was profiting from the echo chamber of hatred created by its hate-spiralling algorithms.”Amnesty’s reassessment of Facebook’s role in the genocide is based on the cache of documents released by the whistleblower Frances Haugen in 2021, which “enable a renewed understanding of the manner in which [Facebook’s] content shaping algorithms filed the mass violence”, the report said.In a statement, Meta’s Rafael Frankel said: “Our safety and integrity work in Myanmar remains guided by feedback from local civil society organisations and international institutions, including the UN fact-finding mission on Myanmar; the human rights impact assessment we commissioned in 2018; as well as our ongoing human rights risk management.”Additional reporting by Alex Hern",[{'name': 'Rebecca Ratcliffe and agencies'}],Aung San Suu Kyi and Australian adviser handed three years’ jail after secret trial
68,"Apple has begun making iPhone 14s in India, as it moves some production away from China for the first time against a backdrop of Chinese Covid-19 pandemic lockdowns and geopolitical tensions between the US and the country’s communist government.A production line in Chennai has begun operation, assembling the iPhone 14 for the domestic Indian market. The move, which marks the first time the company has assembled iPhones outside of China in the same year they were released, is part of a plan to disentangle its manufacturing operations from the Chinese state.Apple unveiled its latest line-up of iPhones earlier this month. The iPhone 14 will have improved cameras, faster processors and longer lasting batteries at the same prices as last year’s models.India is the world’s second-largest smartphone market after China and Apple has been assembling phones there since 2017. But until now, manufacturing operations in the country, alongside similar operations in Brazil, had been focused on assembling older models.According to a report from analysts at JP Morgan, Apple is aiming to produce a quarter of all iPhone 14s in India by 2025, and the same proportion of all its products outside China by the same date, compared with about 5% now. The company also intends to produce a fifth of all its iPads and Apple Watches, and more than half of all its AirPods, in factories in Vietnam by the same date.Relations between China and the US have become increasingly strained, causing difficulties for Apple.This summer, Apple requested suppliers in Taiwan – including chip manufacturers – to label the origin of their products as “Chinese Taipei” in order to comply with a long-standing but previously unenforced Chinese rule that requires imported goods to falsely suggest the island is part of the People’s Republic of China. The request followed the US House speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taipei.Taiwan has an opposite rule, requiring products be labelled as either “Taiwan” or the country’s official name, “Republic of China”.The choice to require suppliers to deny Taiwan’s independent existence has led to criticism from around the world.GreatFire, which works against Chinese censorship online, noted that the move was an escalation from a previous decision by Apple, which removed the Taiwan flag from emoji keyboards for users in China and Hong Kong.“Is it a question of time before Apple starts removing apps whose name contains the characters [for] Taiwan without specifying ‘province of China’?” the organisation asked.",[{'name': 'Alex Hern'}],Apple shifts some iPhone 14 production from China to India
69,"An emergency plan is being drawn up to save the capercaillie, one of the UK’s most elusive and threatened woodland birds, after its numbers plunged.The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds said the latest population survey found its estimated population had fallen from roughly 1,114 in 2015/16 to about 542 birds last winter, putting it at a critically low level.Officials in the Cairngorms national park are working on plans to close and reroute paths used by ramblers, dog walkers and mountain bikers through the Highland forests where capercaillie mate and nests, in a final effort to halt the species’ decline.In previous surveys 20 and 30 years ago, ornithologists estimated there were roughly 2,000 capercaillie in Scotland. Since then, unfavourable weather during early summer – thought to be influenced by climate change – has frequently hit their breeding.Once seen as far west as Loch Lomond and across Highland Perthshire, the bird is now almost entirely restricted to forests in the Badenoch and Strathspey area of the Cairngorms, where it feeds on blaeberries, pine seeds and shoots.The capercaillie is the largest member of the grouse family. It was the first species to be deliberately reintroduced into the UK, from Sweden in 1837. It had previously been hunted into extinction, and this year the scientific advisory committee for NatureScot, the government conservation agency, warned that at the present rate of decline it could again become extinct in the UK in two to three decades.Landowners have been stripping out deer fences known to kill capercaillie as they fly, introduced voluntary requests for walkers to keep dogs on their leads and asked walkers and mountain bikers to stay on marked paths through breeding areas from April to August.Intensive efforts are under way to increase native pine forests in the Cairngorms, the main capercaillie habitat, through an alliance of landowners called Cairngorms Connect, some of whom are at the forefront of the rewilding movement in the Highlands.Andy Ford, the park’s director of nature and climate change, said there were now moves in hand to stop walkers, cyclists and dogs disturbing capercaillie during the breeding season, when males gather in mating areas known as a lek – the Old Norse word for play – to fight, display and establish dominance.He said the national park and its partners were pursuing more radical proposals. The survey results had “really brought home the sense of urgency”, he said. “We’ve seen the capercaillie declining and have invested a significant amount of time and money doing what we can. What this does is say we need to do more. We’re going to need an emergency plan for the next three to five years. What more do we need to do to act at speed, and act together wherever possible?”Ford said the national park put heavy emphasis on collaborative agreements with residents and visitors; mountain bikers and ramblers had already shown they were committed to voluntary restrictions.

70,"A majority of the public believe nature is under threat and needs urgent action to protect and restore it, according to a YouGov poll.The poll for the National Trust, RSPB and WWF comes as they and other mainstream green groups are mobilising their millions of members to counter what they say is the government’s attack on nature.More than 8,000 adults were surveyed before the government announced the creation of low-tax investment zones, where “burdensome” environmental and planning rules will be lifted, and details emerged of the scale of environmental laws derived from the EU that are to be scrapped or rewritten in the retained EU law revocation and reform bill.Eighty-one per cent of the respondents said they believed nature was under threat and that more needed to be done urgently to protect and restore it. Forty-eight per cent said they were willing to take action themselves to reverse the damage.The charities are inviting people to develop a set of public demands to protect nature’s future by visiting peoplesplanfornature.org before 30 October. They are also calling on the prime minister, Liz Truss, and the environment secretary, Ranil Jayawardena, to take rapid action. The YouGov poll published on Friday suggests the public want action to clean up rivers, greater consideration of nature in the planning and house-building system and strengthened legal protections. Most of these protections stem from EU laws that were rolled over into UK law after Brexit. They are now under threat from a new bill that has listed 570 environmental laws to be taken off the statute books by December 2023. They include laws that cover sewage pollution in rivers, air quality and pesticide controls.The majority of respondents said they had witnessed a decline in nature and wildlife in their local area, 65% in the number and variety of insects they see, 58% in birds, 60% in mammals and 59% in green spaces such as parks and woodlands.The director general of the National Trust, Hilary McGrady, , the CEO of the RSPB, Beccy Speight, and the chief executive of WWF-UK, Tanya Steele, said in a joint statement: “This government, elected on their greenest ever manifesto, is now contemplating breaking its promises on vital protections for the UK’s nature, risking catastrophic consequences.“From abandoning fundamental legal protections for wildlife to failing farmers committed to sustainable agriculture, this would be an attack on nature at the worst possible time.“The desire to defend nature unites people in every community from Caerphilly to Cumbria, Antrim to Aberdeen, and we must all be part of the conversation about how we protect and restore it.”In response to the outpouring of anger from mainstream environmental charities towards government policies this week, Jayawardena attempted to “set the record straight”.He said the claims that government policies including low-tax investment zones and apparent changes to the environment land management system, which pays farmers to make environmental improvements, were harmful to nature were “simply untrue.”",[{'name': 'Sandra Laville Environment correspondent'}],Most UK adults think nature is in urgent need of protection – poll
71,"Liz Truss has previously suggested universal benefits such as the state pension should be scrapped because of the “huge expense” to taxpayers of “recycling” their money through the system – prompting fears she could go further still with her plans to cut back the benefits bill.The proposal, included in her motion to the Liberal Democrat Youth conference in spring 1995, highlighted the “enormous – and rising – cost of pensions and child benefit”, calling for a “search for realistic alternatives to universal benefits”.Truss, who left the party the next year to join the Conservatives, had added that it was not “socially desirable to pay out universal benefits in the current fashion”, given the “huge expense to the taxpayers of recycling money through the tax system”.Child benefit was removed for higher-rate taxpayers in 2013 but remains universal for some families earning below the £50,000 threshold who do not qualify for universal credit. All older people qualify for a state pension and winter fuel benefits.There is no suggestion Truss plans to scrap either benefit, but her earlier views may raise concerns, as she promised to clamp down on the benefits system during her leadership campaign and has already announced plans to cut working age benefits and for “efficiency savings” across all government departments.The Lib Dem pensions spokesperson, Wendy Chamberlain, said: “We are seeing this government’s true colours. It’s little surprise Liz Truss is refusing to provide help to those who need it most given she has long wanted to scrap the state pension and child benefits.“The Conservative government could not be more out of touch with the British people. As inflation sky-rockets, interest rates spiral and borrowing surges, they’d rather give tax cuts to banks, massive corporations and billionaires than guarantee support for struggling families and pensioners.”A No 10 spokesperson said: “The prime minister’s views are not the same as they were 27 years ago.” However, Truss continues to argue that taxpayers’ money should not “recycled” – or collected by the state only to be redistributed back to them.Kwasi Kwarteng, the chancellor, has already announced plans to cut benefits to encourage more people into the job market, saying that this was part of the government’s plan to “make work pay” by not allowing people to rely solely on welfare as their main form of income.However, the controversial plan has provoked widespread criticism as it ignores people who are out of work because of illness or disability, while unpaid carers, part-time workers and single parents could be unfairly hit by benefit cuts.Chris Philp, the chief secretary to the Treasury, said the government had not yet decided if it would increase benefits in line with inflation, despite Rishi Sunak promising to do so when he was chancellor. Philp defended removing the 45p rate of income tax, despite saying it was “true” that it benefited the rich more than the worse off.Kwarteng, on a visit to Darlington, said it was “premature” to confirm if benefits would rise to match inflation. “We are talking about helping people in the round. It is premature for me to come to a decision on that. But we are absolutely focused on making sure that the most vulnerable in our society are protected through what could be a challenging time,” he said.Sign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterArchie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morningPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Just the fact that he’s reconsidering it, or he’s not committing to it, makes it feel like this is genuinely up for reconsideration.”The Joseph Rowntree Foundation, a charity that conducts and funds research aimed at solving poverty in the UK, said it was “shocking” that the government may not increase benefits by inflation. Iain Porter, a senior policy adviser, said: “Many people across the UK will agree it is morally indefensible that the prime minister would choose to give tax cuts to the richest funded on the backs of the poorest in our society.”James Taylor, director of strategy at the disability equality charity Scope, said: “If the government U-turns on this promise, it would be devastating and lead to disabled people starving and freezing in their own homes. Refusing to increase benefits in line with the true inflation rate would show an utter disdain towards people who need this support.”Alison Garnham, chief executive of Child Poverty Action Group, said: “Children are already going hungry as costs soar. Unless benefits are uprated to match inflation, they will also become the casualties of a collapsing economy. Struggling families will not forgive a chancellor who comes to them for efficiency savings when their cupboards are already bare.”",[{'name': 'Pippa Crerar Political editor'}],Early Liz Truss comments on scrapping benefits stoke fears of further cuts
72,"Hundreds of child asylum seekers are at risk of abuse and neglect due to the Home Office wrongly classifying them as adults, according to two new reports.Reports from the Refugee Council and Greater Manchester Immigration Aid Unit (GMIAU), published on Friday, highlight concerns about the way the Home Office is treating young people upon arriving in the UK.Charities say  over unaccompanied asylum seeker children in UK Read moreThe Home Office does not publish comprehensive data about all stages of the age assessment process for young asylum seekers. The two new reports have been compiled from a mix of freedom of information (FoI) requests to local authorities and their own casework files.According to freedom of information data gathered from 64 local authorities by human rights charity the Helen Bamber Foundation, at least 450 young people who were age disputed by the Home Office in 2021 were referred to local authorities for assessment. Three-quarters of them were found to be children.In the first three months of this year, 211 young asylum seekers were referred to council children’s services after initially having been placed in adult accommodation by the Home Office – two-thirds of them were found to be children. A total of 150 of them were initially placed either in detention centres or in adult accommodation. The Refugee Council has run an Age Disputes Project since 2010. Last year, the it worked with 233 young people whom the Home Office determined to “certainly” be adults. But, after age assessments, 94% were found to be children.The data the government does publish on age assessments can be open to misinterpretation. The organisation Full Fact found some media outlets had incorrectly stated that two-thirds of asylum seekers arriving in the UK between January 2018 and March 2022 who claimed to be children were actually adults. In fact, it showed roughly 20% were in fact adults.The government rules around age assessment have changed. Previously, young people who looked “significantly over 25” were classed as adults by Home Office officials. Now these officials can assess young people as adults if they look “significantly over 18”. The Home Office has set up a new National Age Assessment Board with its own social workers carrying out age assessments.In one case, a 16-year-old was wrongly assessed to be 28 by the Home Office. In another, a 17-year-old was assessed as being six years older than he was. Human rights campaigners are fearful that children wrongly age assessed as adults could be forcibly removed to Rwanda by the Home Office.The Refugee Council has called for the Home Office to publish full data on age assessments for young asylum seekers and for independent oversight of the process from an Ofsted-style body.Sign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterArchie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morningPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We urge the government to immediately take heed of our recommendations and do better by vulnerable children it has a duty to protect.”The GMIAU report states: “We call for a drastic change in Home Office culture and decision-making as well as safeguards to ensure children are protected from harm.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “Age assessments are challenging but vital. Children are at risk when asylum-seeking adults claim to be children, or children are wrongly treated as adults. Our reforms through the Nationality and Borders Act aim to make assessments more consistent and robust by using scientific measures, and creating a new national age assessment board. If there is doubt whether a claimant is an adult or child, they will be referred for a local authority assessment and will be treated as a child until a decision on their age is made.”",[{'name': 'Diane Taylor'}],"Home Office age disputes putting child asylum seekers at risk, reports find"
73,"Some nurses are so hard up that they are having to not eat at work in order to feed and clothe their children, research among hospital bosses has found.Lack of money is also prompting some NHS staff to call in sick in the days before they get paid because they can no longer afford the travel costs for their shift. Others are taking a second job outside the NHS in an effort to make ends meet.The impact of the cost of living crisis on health service workers in England has emerged in a survey of chief executives, chairs and other senior figures in health trusts undertaken by NHS Providers, which represents trusts.Most UK medical students struggle to afford essentials, survey finds Read moreMiriam Deakin, the director of policy and strategy at NHS Providers, said: “There are heart-rending stories of nurses choosing between eating during the day and being able to buy a school uniform for their children at home.“Increasing numbers of nurses and other staff, particularly in the lower pay bands, are finding they are unable to afford to work in the NHS.”More than a quarter (27%) of trusts already operate food banks for staff, and another 19% plan to open one, to help relieve the acute financial difficulties faced by staff.The survey also found that some staff:
Are stopping contributing to their NHS pension in order to free up cash.
Cannot fill up their cars because of petrol price rises.
Have mental health issues due to the stress of paying their bills.
The situation is so serious that some low-paid health staff, such as healthcare assistants, are quitting their jobs in the NHS and taking better-paid roles in pubs and shops instead, NHS chiefs said. Two-thirds (68%) of trusts said that staff leaving for better terms and conditions elsewhere was having a “significant or severe impact”, and exacerbating existing recruitment and retention problems.Deakin said: “Trust leaders are seeing a slowdown in people willing to join the NHS, as well as looking to join other industries such as hospitality or retail which offer more competitive pay. The sad fact is some can earn more working for online retailers or in supermarkets.“It’s like the UK has gone back to Victorian times, when workers were so poor they couldn’t afford to feed their families,” said Sara Gorton, head of health at the union Unison.“This is a shocking state of affairs. Ministers should be ashamed that things have come to this.”The Guardian reported last month how trusts are trying to help staff cope with soaring inflation through a variety of schemes, including offering hardship grants, paying for children’s school uniforms and providing low-cost food in their restaurants.Trusts are bracing themselves for a potential wave of strikes this winter by staff angry at the government offering them only a 3% pay rise at a time when inflation is about 10%. One trust boss said that possible coordination of walkouts by different groups of workers could make it difficult for normal services to be maintained.NHS Providers also found cost of living pressures were affecting patients, with more people attending A&E with related mental health issues. Some patients who had to visit hospital regularly had started to only attend some appointments because of the travel costs involved.A government spokesperson said: “We know NHS staff are struggling with cost of living pressures, and we have given over 1 million NHS staff a pay rise of at least £1,400 in line with the recommendations of the independent pay review body.“The government has also taken action to save a typical household an average of £1,000 a year on energy bills through a new ‘energy price guarantee’ – protecting them from soaring energy costs.”",[{'name': 'Denis Campbell Health policy editor'}],"NHS nurses not eating at work in order to feed their children, survey finds"

75,"The “catastrophic” scale of the damage wreaked by Hurricane Ian’s 150mph deadly rampage across Florida has become clearer as emergency crews rescued trapped residents from flooded homes, and authorities expressed fears of a growing death toll.As South Carolina braced for Ian to make a second landfall on Friday, search and rescue crews in south-west Florida conducted hundreds of missions in areas that were submerged by a storm surge of up to 18ft after one of the most powerful storms to strike the US swept ashore on Wednesday.With all of South Carolina’s coast under a hurricane warning, a steady stream of vehicles left Charleston on Thursday, many likely heeding officials’ warnings to seek higher ground. Storefronts were sandbagged to ward off high water levels in an area prone to inundation.Along the Battery area at the southern tip of the 350-year-old city’s peninsula, locals and tourists alike took selfies against the choppy backdrop of whitecaps in Charleston harbor as palm trees bent in gusty wind.Hurricane Ian: 'Historic storm' wreaks havoc in Florida as trapped residents are rescued - videoFlorida governor Ron DeSantis gave a briefing on Thursday night where said at least 700 rescues, mostly by air, had been conducted so far, involving the US Coast Guard, the National Guard and urban search-and-rescue teams.Joe Biden said Ian “could be the deadliest hurricane in Florida’s history”, adding at an afternoon briefing at the headquarters of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) that he was “hearing early reports of what may be substantial loss of life”.Local officials were more cautious. Chris Constance, commissioner of Charlotte county, said he knew of six confirmed fatalities, but was unaware of the circumstances. In Lee county, sheriff Carmine Marceno said he was aware of “roughly five”.Hurricane Ian map - 18.23 BST updateAuthorities confirmed at least one Florida death – a 72-year-old man in Deltona who fell into a canal while using a hose to drain his pool in the heavy rain, the Volusia county sheriff’s office said. Two storm deaths were reported in Cuba.Earlier in the day Ian had been downgraded to a tropical storm as it crept across the Florida peninsula and emerged in the Atlantic Ocean but regained hurricane level, category one, in the early evening as it spun towards South Carolina where it was expected to makes its second landfall on Friday morning local time.The National Hurricane Center said that by midnight the storm’s maximum sustained winds increased to more than 80mph (128km/h), and governors of Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia declared states of emergency.Eighteen Cuban migrants missing after boat sinks during Hurricane IanRead moreBiden also declared a state of emergency in South Carolina, where some Charlotte residents had chosen to evacuate on Thursday afternoon.In coastal south-west Florida, desperate residents posted to social media sites, pleading for rescue for themselves or loved ones.

Photograph: Giorgio Viera/AFP/Getty ImagesDeSantis said Ian’s impact across Florida was widespread, caused by flooding from a deluge of three months’ worth of rain in 48 hours in some areas, the unprecedented storm surge, and category 4 winds.Aerial video and photographs showed massive devastation and flooding in beach communities from Naples to Fort Myers, with homes and businesses reduced to matchwood, and other buildings, mobile homes, boats and vehicles totally wrecked or submerged.More than 2 million people remained without power, DeSantis said, adding that some areas could be without electricity for weeks while power grids are completely rebuilt.“The impacts of this storm are historic, and the damage that was done has been historic. And this is just off initial assessment,” he said.“This storm is having broad impacts across the state, and some of the flooding you’re going to see in areas hundreds of miles from where this made landfall are going to set records.”A resident at a mobile home park checks homes in Fort Myers, Florida, on Thursday, one day after Hurricane Ian made landfall. Photograph: Joseph Agcaoili/AFP/Getty ImagesIn an afternoon update, DeSantis spoke of a “biblical storm surge” sweeping across Sanibel island. “It’s washed away roads, washed away structures,” he said, referring to the partial collapse of Sanibel causeway, the only road route to the mainland.Biden made a major disaster declaration for nine of the worst-affected counties, freeing federal resources to supplement local rescue and recovery efforts, and guaranteeing government money for an initial 30-day period for costs likely to run into billions of dollars.“Many families are hurting today, and our country hurts with them,” the president said.“We’re continuing to see deadly rainfall, catastrophic storm surges, roads and homes flooded, millions of people without power and thousands hunkered down in schools and community centers.“They’re wondering what’s going to be left when they get to go home.”Biden said federal funds would cover “the majority of the cost of rebuilding public buildings, like schools and fire stations, and folks in Florida who have destroyed or damaged homes”.He said individual assistance payments of up to $75,000 would be available for home repairs or to replace lost property.Residents from Punta Gorda on the south-west coast to Orlando and Cape Canaveral, meanwhile, were assessing the damage from the massive flooding, rainfall and punishing winds.Aerial view of damaged homes in Punta Gorda after Hurricane Ian moved through the Gulf Coast of Florida.

A number of these families are living in mobile homes. We are preparing for the potential of thousands of families that are going to need assistance.”In Lee county, officials were attempting to calculate a death toll. Sheriff Marceno walked back an earlier claim of “hundreds”, but said he feared what rescue crews would find.“There are people I know did not evacuate,” he told CNN. “They tried to take cover, they’ve gone to the second floor and the attic [but] the water got so high here with a surge of approximately 16ft give or take, that’s what’s going to compromise structures and also that’s the most deadly.”Kevin Anderson, the Fort Myers mayor, said rescue operations were continuing and it was too soon for an accurate figure. “I just know there are several deaths related to the storm,” he said.The storm surge flooded the lower-level emergency room of the HCA Florida Fawcett hospital in Port Charlotte, while fierce winds tore part of the fourth-floor roof from its intensive care unit, according to Dr Birgit Bodine.Intensive care staff were forced to evacuate the medium-sized hospital’s sickest patients to other floors.Bodine said incoming storm injuries could make things worse. “The ambulances may be coming soon and we don’t know where to put them in the hospital at this point,” she said. “We’re doubled and tripled up.”The Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this report",[{'name': 'Richard Luscombe in Miami'}],Hurricane Ian: ‘catastrophic’ damage in Florida as storm heads to South Carolina
76,"A federal judge ruled on Thursday that Donald Trump would not have to provide a sworn declaration that the FBI supposedly “planted” some of the highly-sensitive documents seized from his Mar-a-Lago resort, as he has suggested, until his lawyers have reviewed the seized materials.The order from US district court judge Aileen Cannon, who is overseeing the special master case and is a Trump appointee, also pushed back several key interim deadlines that consequently extends the review’s final date of completion from the end of November to mid-December.Cannon’s ruling means Trump does not have to confirm under oath his insinuations that the FBI manufactured evidence – one of several assertions he has made, without evidence, in recent weeks that could be used against him should he be charged over illegal retention of government documents.The order marked the first clash between Cannon and the so-called special master, senior US district court judge Raymond Dearie, who had ordered Trump certify by Friday whether the inventory of seized materials included anything that had not been in his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida.Special master in Trump documents case described as fair and no-nonsenseRead moreDearie’s instruction left Trump’s lawyers in a dilemma: if they acknowledged that the FBI had not planted evidence and in fact, documents marked classified were at the property, that could be used as evidence against Trump given all such documents had previously been subpoenaed.The special master had also ordered Trump to sort any documents over which he intended to assert executive privilege into two buckets: privilege to shield materials from people outside the executive branch, such as Congress, and people inside the executive branch, such as the justice department.But in siding with Trump’s lawyers who resisted making such declarations, in part because it could form defense arguments should Trump be indicted, Cannon’s order said that the former president did not have to make such a statement, at least for now.“There shall be no separate requirement on plaintiff at this stage, prior to the review of any of the seized materials, to lodge ex ante final objections to the accuracy of defendant’s inventory, its descriptions, or its content,” the judge wrote.Cannon also extended the entire timeline of the special master process, delaying the final completion of the review to 16 December, as she pushed back a number of key interim deadlines that would govern how quickly the examination of the 11,000 documents proceeds.The delays would not affect the justice department’s criminal investigation into Trump’s potential retention of national defense information, after the US court of appeals for the 11th circuit ruled this month the government could regain access to about 100 documents marked classified.But it does ensure that Trump now does not have to address under oath whether he supposedly declassified the documents found at Mar-a-Lago or that the FBI planted some of the seized materials – he has supplied no evidence for either claim – until after the midterm elections in November.The judge wrote that Trump and the justice department would have until 5 October to finalize a contract with a vendor to digitize the 11,000 documents so the review can commence, and gave the justice department until 13 October to make copies of the documents available to Trump’s team.The justice department should file a notice of completion by 14 October, the ruling said, and then Trump would have 21 days after the notice is filed to designate whether they think any of the documents are protected by privilege and which are presidential or personal records.“Plaintiff’s designations shall be on a document-by-document basis,” Cannon wrote. “For any document that plaintiff designates as privileged and/or personal, plaintiff shall include a statement adequately explaining the precise basis for the designation.”The former president’s lawyers and the justice department then have no more than 10 days to submit to Dearie a log about any disagreements over the privilege claims, after which the order instructed the special master to issue a report and recommendations to resolve any disputes.Cannon also sided with Trump regarding how the process should take place: Cannon rejected the recommendation by the justice department to have Trump make privilege claims on a rolling basis and ordered Trump to make one comprehensive log at the end of the 21-day review period.",[{'name': 'Hugo Lowell in New York'}],Trump not required to provide sworn declaration that FBI ‘planted’ evidence

In the video, Ross is shown trudging across rapid-flowing waters as he makes his way towards the cat. As he nears the cat, he gently picks it up and holds it tightly towards his chest.The cat appears to be wet and clings tightly onto Ross, occasionally looking at the camera. Ross’s mother, Marybeth Ross, filmed the rescue and can be heard saying, “Look at Michael saving the kitty. Awww!”The video has since been viewed 3.4m times on Twitter and has garnered praise and celebration. “I’m sorry, Megan, but he is everyone’s boyfriend now. I don’t make the rules,” wrote one user.“Watching him approach the cat with respect was beautiful! That poor sweetie was clearly afraid, and trusted him to care for it,” someone else said.Nevertheless, others have expressed concerns towards the many more animals that will not be saved during the storm. “This kitty was saved, but I daren’t think of how many others won’t be. It breaks my heart,” one person wrote.Ross and his girlfriend have since named the cat Ian and have launched a fundraising page to raise money for their home which was badly damaged by the hurricane.“We are a young couple in Naples, FL raising money to help restore our home – which suffered terrible damage – and the homes of others after the devastation seen from Hurricane Ian,” they wrote. “In honor of Ian, and all people and pets affected, we are donating half of the proceeds raised by this to the Naples Humane Society,” they added.

78,"Young people from some of the countries most affected by climate breakdown have warned they are not victims but a force to be reckoned with in the run-up to a UN climate conference in Egypt.Led by climate groups across Africa and the Middle East, hundreds of activists from countries that are the least responsible for the crisis but are experiencing the worst impacts have gathered in Tunisia to prepare for what they say will be a collective fight for justice for their countries and communities, which they will take to Cop27 next month.They are campaigning on issues including adaptation funding and recompense for damage from countries that have been the most responsible for global heating.At Cop26 in Glasgow, delegates promised to give a total of $350m to help the worst affected countries adapt to the climate emergency. But promises for funding have been broken in the past, and the issue of adaptation funding, along with demands for loss and damage funding to be paid to vulnerable countries by the US and Europe, is a clash point with the global south.Maria Reyes, 20, from Mexico, attended the Tunis climate camp because her experience as a representative of the global south at Cop26 was so disappointing. She said the gathering was exclusive and member states wasted time arguing over commas, rather than tackling the issues that mattered.“I came home after the Cop with a deep need to get involved in local resistance, because Glasgow made me lose all confidence in international politics and made me realise that the real resistance against the climate crisis comes from grassroots and indigenous communities,” she said. “I wanted to join the camp to be part of the construction of a space in which we can develop capacities and plan how we can articulate ourselves during Cop.”Ayisha Siddiqa, 23, an activist from Pakistan, who has organised many school strikes for climate since 2019, believes in order to fight the crisis, people have to address the injustices that mean people from Middle East, Africa, Latin America and southern Asia, whose countries contributed least, are suffering the most.“I come from a tribal community in northern Pakistan and our way of life is in extreme danger as heatwaves become more common, our glaciers melt and flash flooding wipes away entire villages. These are things we cannot adapt to, and loss of community, culture and families we can not recover from … I was very eager to attend this camp in Tunisia and build a community with people who have been doing environmental work on ground.”Some of those who attended the camp will travel to Egypt for Cop27, in the hope that the conference will this time properly address the needs of countries least responsible for the climate emergency.Omar Elmawi, 34, from Kenya, is a climate activist who has coordinated a campaign to stop the world’s longest heated crude oil pipeline in east Africa, which is forecast will contribute at least 700m tonnes of CO2 in the 20 years it is expected to be operational.“Cognisant that I am one of the 3.6 billion people in the developing countries that are bearing the brunt of the climate crisis while we have done little to nothing to cause the problem, joining the camp allowed me to meet and know my fellow climate victims from other global south countries,” Elmawi said.Sign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterArchie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morningPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

79,"Campaigners are calling for urgent action to tackle what they say is a rise in “honour killings” in Sudan.Eleven women and girls have reportedly been killed by relatives so far this year, more than double the number reported in 2021. Two women have died in the past month.Aisha Abakar died after an alleged attack by her father and brothers last week, after they reportedly learned that the unmarried 18-year-old from South Darfur state was pregnant. Her sister, aged 17, was reported to be in a critical condition in hospital after being injured in the same attack. Three men have been arrested.Three days earlier, Tayeser Jumaa, 21, was allegedly killed by her brothers and cousins who believed that she was talking to men on her mobile phone, a campaigner told the Guardian. No arrests have been made.Nahla Yousif, head of the Future Development Organisation, a women’s rights group based in South Darfur state, said the reported cases were the “tip of the iceberg”.“I believe there are so many other similar crimes in the villages and towns that are far from the media. We only get to hear about those which are taken to the police,” she said. “It’s all about ignorance and lack of awareness, they think it’s shameful to see their daughters having relationships. These crimes have always been here, but they are now increasing due to the lack of accountability.”Yousif said more younger women were being targeted because they owned mobile phones.“Even the young women who are activists working in important fields documenting the abuses people go through in the [displacement] camps are now targeted by their relatives,” she said. “We have had to offer shelter to some women because they had smartphones and their relatives assumed they would be chatting with men.”The majority of reported cases this year have occurred in Darfur, where for decades rape has been used as a weapon against women by the Janjaweed militias. Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, who founded the Janjaweed and is head of the feared Rapid Support Forces, is now vice-president of Sudan’s governing sovereign council.Yousif said her organisation was planning protests to raise awareness of “honour killings” and was writing to the Darfur Bar Association to urge lawyers to push for cases to go to court, and not be quietly settled with families.Sulaima Ishaq, head of the unit to stop violence against women in the Ministry of Social Affairs, said the rise in attacks was partly due to the coup in October last year, which had disrupted government institutions.Growing up in the long shadow of Darfur’s genocide  – in picturesRead more“There is no system in place, nothing is functioning, the judicial system is not working,” she said. “They [the government] are too busy releasing those who killed the martyrs during the revolution, despite saying that they did the coup for the safety and the security of the people of Sudan.”Research conducted by the Arab Barometer in 2019 showed that more than a quarter of people over the age of 35 in Sudan thought that “honour killings” were acceptable.In July, a Sudanese woman was sentenced to death by stoning for adultery for the first time in 10 years.Domestic violence is not outlawed in Sudan.",[{'name': 'Zeinab Mohammed Salih in Khartoum'}],Sudan campaigners demand action after alarming rise in ‘honour killings’
80,"Angry protesters have attacked the French embassy in Burkina Faso’s capital after supporters of the west African nation’s new coup leader accused France of harbouring the ousted interim president, a charge French authorities vehemently denied.Lt Col Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba was overthrown late on Friday less than nine months after he mounted a coup in Burkina Faso, which has been failing to effectively counter rising violence by Islamic extremists.Comments by a junta spokesperson on Saturday set into motion an outburst of anger in Ouagadougou, the capital.“Damiba has tried to retreat to the Kamboinsin French military base to prepare a counter-offensive in order to sow divide amongst our defense and security forces,” said Lt Jean Baptiste Kabre, reading a statement on behalf of the new junta leadership.Burkina Faso’s military leader ousted in second coup this yearRead moreVideo on social media showed residents with lit torches outside the perimeter of the French embassy, and other images showed part of the compound ablaze.In Burkina Faso’s second-largest city, Bobo-Dioulasso, angry crowds also vandalised the French Institute.Damiba’s whereabouts remained unknown but France’s foreign ministry issued a strongly worded statement. “We formally deny involvement in the events unfolding in Burkina Faso. The camp where the French forces are based has never hosted Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba, nor has our embassy,” it said.French foreign ministry spokesperson Anne-Claire Legendre later told France-24 on Saturday night that it was a “confusing situation” in Ouagadougou and she urged French citizens to stay at home.Ibrahim Traore, the 34-year-old army captain who was named in charge after the Friday evening coup was announced on state television, said in interviews that he and his men did not seek to harm Damiba, who unlike other deposed leaders in the region has yet to offer his resignation.“If we wanted, we would take him within five minutes of fighting and maybe he would be dead, the president. But we don’t want this catastrophe,” Traore told the Voice of America. “We don’t want to harm him, because we don’t have any personal problem with him. We’re fighting for Burkina Faso.”He later told Radio Omega: “We have no intention to bring Damiba to justice. We only wish that he would go rest because he is tired, and as for us we are going to continue to do the work.”Roads remained blocked off in Ouagadougou and a helicopter could be heard flying overhead. An internal security analysis for the EU seen by the Associated Press said there was “abnormal military movement” in the city.As uncertainty prevailed, the international community widely condemned the ousting of Damiba, who overthrew the country’s democratically elected president in January. The African Union and the west African region bloc known as Ecowas sharply criticised the developments.“ECOWAS finds this new power grab inappropriate at a time when progress has been made,” the bloc said, citing Damiba’s recent agreement to return to constitutional order by July 2024.After taking power in January, Damiba promised to end the Islamic extremist violence that has forced 2 million people to flee their homes in Burkina Faso. But the group of officers led by Traore said on Friday that Damiba had failed and was being removed.The new junta leadership said it would commit “all fighting forces to refocus on the security issue and the restoration of the integrity of our territory”.But it remains to be seen whether the junta can turn around the crisis. Concerns were mounting on Saturday that the latest political volatility would further distract the military and allow the jihadis to strengthen their grip on the once-peaceful country.For some in Burkina Faso’s military, Damiba was seen as too cozy with former coloniser France, which maintains a military presence in Africa’s Sahel region to help countries fight Islamic extremists. Some who support the new coup leader, Traore, have called on Burkina Faso’s government to seek Russian support instead.",[{'name': 'Associated Press in Ouagadougou'}],Protesters attack French embassy in Burkina Faso over allegedly harbouring ousted president
81,"Two wildlife organisations, including one headed by Prince Harry, have been accused of caring about animals more than people after three men died following an elephant translocation in Malawi.In July, more than 250 elephants were moved from Liwonde national park in southern Malawi to the country’s second-largest protected area, Kasungu, in a three-way operation between Malawi’s national park service and the NGOs African Parks and the International Fund for Animal Welfare (Ifaw).The translocation was among the largest of its kind ever attempted, according to the NGOs, which have since used images of the 263 elephants being transported for fundraising, with videos of the huge animals being lifted by crane described as “scenes reminiscent of the Disney classic Dumbo”.But the promotional video and blog posts do not mention that two people in nearby communities were killed during the translocation by two bull elephants moved to Kasungu national park in July. A third person was killed by an elephant in September.The Guardian has seen images of the men after they were trampled, and a community representative said that elephants and buffaloes had been straying into villages near the park, looking for food on farms and scaring villagers.Malidadi Langa, chair of an association of villages near Kasungu national park, said Ifaw and the national park service had not finished building a fence to protect communities before moving the elephants. He said African Parks, whose president, the prince, has helped with previous translocations in Malawi, had rushed the movement of the animals.“We welcomed the translocation of these elephants because it will improve tourism for Kasungu. But we believe they should have completed the fence first,” Langa said. “When they moved the first batch of elephants, within a week or so they had broken out of the park from the unfenced side and went into villages. One guy was killed. When we raised the issue, they said the elephants are disoriented and bound to get out of the park. Around the same week, an elephant killed someone else on the other side of the park.“The irony is that Liwonde national park, from where the elephants came, which is run by African Parks, is fully fenced,” he said. “The experience has shown that these conservation agencies care more about animals than people.”In a statement, Malawi’s national park service confirmed three men had died: Collins Chisi, 40, and Joseph Blackson, 29, in two separate incidents on 12 July, and John Kayedzeka, 30, who died on 16 September. They said in all of the deaths, community members had got too close to the animals while taking photos. Two bull elephants were shot dead in accordance with Malawian law after the first two incidents.Langa said the families of those who died were facing uncertain futures, and urged the NGOs to provide continued financial support. He said they had been given a one-off payment of about $160 (£140).Ifaw is understood to be exploring how to give more support to the families but disputed that there was an agreement with the community about a fence before the elephants were moved. The NGO said it had already funded the construction of 25 miles of fencing and had committed to repairing and extending a further 15 miles on the park’s eastern boundary, where the incident occurred.“In all, 150 community members – including women – have been employed to work on the fence. A squad patrols the fence daily to ensure it remains unbreached and that any damage is swiftly repaired,” a spokesperson for Ifaw said.“To prevent any further risk to the local communities, security has been enhanced with helicopter availability, rapid response rangers stationed at the extreme ends of the fence, and satellite-collared elephants monitored 24/7,” the spokesperson added. Support had been provided to the dead men’s families, including providing food, transport and coffins for the funerals.The elephant population in Liwonde, where the elephants came from, had grown to nearly 600, causing damage to the park’s biodiversity and increasing the risk of human-elephant conflict in surrounding villages, according to African Parks.To ease pressure on Liwonde the elephants were moved, along with buffalo, impala, sable, warthog and waterbuck, to Kasungu, which is four times the size and where the wildlife population has been depleted by poaching.It is us we are waiting for! Africa needs to shape its own conservation and climate agendaRead moreIn a statement, African Parks rejected the suggestion that it had rushed the translocation and said it had been saddened by news of the deaths. It said after further reflection, it would be updating a blog post with information about the translocation and the dangers of conservation work.“Human-wildlife conflict in a country like Malawi is very real and the impact on local people as a result of living in close proximity to dangerous animals like elephants can be significant,” a spokesperson said. “The park management continues to engage with local communities to learn from and improve efforts around human-wildlife conflict mitigation, including implementing an innovative approach to fencing which is proving more successful.“While all parks managed by African Parks in Malawi are fenced, this is not a perfect solution and breakouts of elephants can and do still occur, resulting in a threat to human life and crops.”The prince was not involved in this translocation with African Parks, it is understood.Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",[{'name': 'Patrick Greenfield and Sundus Abdi'}],Prince Harry wildlife NGO under fire after elephants kill three in Malawi
82,"Members of Burkina Faso’s army have seized control of state television, declaring that they had ousted military leader Paul-Henri Damiba, dissolved the government and suspended the constitution and transitional charter. In a statement read on national television late on Friday, Captain Ibrahim Traore said a group of officers had decided to remove Damiba due to his inability to deal with a worsening Islamist insurgency. He announced that borders were closed indefinitely and that all political and civil society activities were suspended.It is the second takeover in eight months for the west African state. Damiba took power in a coup in January that ousted democratically elected president Roch Marc Kaboré.Damiba and his allies promised to make the country more secure, but violence has continued unabated and frustration with his leadership has grown in recent months.The statement came after a day of uncertainty, with gunfire ringing out in the capital, Ouagadougou.“In the face of the continuing deterioration of the security situation, we have repeatedly tried to refocus the transition on security issues,” said the statement read aloud on Friday evening by the soldiers. The soldiers promised the international community they would respect their commitments and urged Burkinabes “to go about their business in peace.”Amid growing uncertainties, the UN voiced concern and appealed for calm.“Burkina Faso needs peace, it needs stability, and it needs unity in order to fight terrorist groups and criminal networks operating in parts of the country,” UN spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said.Contagious coups: what is fuelling military takeovers across west Africa?Read moreOn the streets of Ouagadougou, some were showing support for the country’s new leaders.“We are demonstrating to support this coup, confirmed or not,” said Francois Beogo, a political activist from the Movement for the Refounding of Burkina Faso. “For us, it is already a coup.”Beogo said Damiba “has showed his limits” during his short time in power. “People were expecting a real change,” he added.Some demonstrators voiced support for Russian involvement in order to stem the violence, and shouted slogans critical of France, Burkina Faso’s former coloniser. In neighbouring Mali, the junta invited Russian mercenaries from the Wagner Group to help secure the country, though their deployment has drawn international criticism.Last week, Damiba had travelled to New York where he addressed the UN general assembly. In his speech, Damiba defended his January coup as “an issue of survival for our nation”, even if it was “perhaps reprehensible” to the international community. On Thursday, he had given a speech in Djibo, in Burkina Faso’s volatile north.Burkina Faso’s January coup followed similar takeovers in Mali and in Guinea, heightening fears of a rollback of democracy in west Africa. None of the juntas have committed to a date for new elections, though Damiba said last week that the transition in Burkina Faso would last for almost two more years.Many in Burkina Faso initially supported the military takeover, frustrated with the previous government’s inability to stem Islamist violence that has killed thousands and displaced at least 2 million. Yet the violence has failed to wane in the months since Damiba took over. Earlier this month, he also took over the position of defence minister after dismissing a brigadier general from the post.Earlier this week at least 11 soldiers were killed and 50 civilians went missing after a supply convoy was attacked by gunmen in Gaskinde commune in Soum province in the Sahel. That attack was “a low point” for Damiba’s government and “likely played a role in inspiring what we’ve seen so far today”, said Eric Humphery-Smith, senior Africa analyst at risk intelligence company Verisk Maplecroft.Chrysogone Zougmore, president of the Burkina Faso Movement for Human Rights, called Friday’s developments “very regrettable”, saying the instability would not help in the fight against the extremist violence.“How can we hope to unite people and the army if the latter is characterised by such serious divisions?” Zougmore said. “It is time for these reactionary and political military factions to stop leading Burkina Faso adrift.”",[{'name': 'Staff and agencies in Ouagadougou'}],Burkina Faso’s military leader ousted in second coup this year
83,"Brazil’s acrimonious presidential race will go to a second round after the former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva failed to secure the overall majority he needed to avoid a runoff with the far-right incumbent, Jair Bolsonaro.With more than 99.5% of votes counted the leftist veteran had secured 48.3% of the vote, not enough to avoid the 30 October show down with his rightwing rival. Bolsonaro, who significantly out-performed pollsters’ predictions and will be buoyed by the result, received 43.3%.Addressing the media at a hotel in central São Paulo, Lula, who was president from 2003 until 2010, struck a defiant tone, declaring: “The struggle continues until our final victory.Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva: the former shoe-shine boy hoping to reclaim Brazil’s presidency Read more“We are going to win these elections – this for us is simply extra time,” vowed Lula, who was barred from the 2018 election in which Bolsonaro was elected, on corruption charges that were later overturned.Speaking on the eve of the election Lula said he was hopeful of a first-round win but would redouble his efforts to reclaim power if a second round was needed.“I feel great hope that this election will be decided tomorrow, but if it isn’t we’ll have to behave like a football team when a match goes to extra time. We’ll rest for 15 minutes and then we’ll get back out on to the pitch to score the goals we didn’t score in normal time,” he told reporters.Gleisi Hoffmann, the president of Lula’s Workers’ party, told reporters the campaign was neither “sad or downcast” at the result and pointed to Lula’s more than 56m votes.“Congratulations, president Lula, for your victory,” she declared.But the election result was a major blow to progressive Brazilians who had been rooting for an emphatic victory over Bolsonaro, a former army captain who has repeatedly attacked the country’s democratic institutions and vandalised Brazil’s international reputation.Bolsonaro is also accused of wreaking havoc on the environment and catastrophically mishandling a Covid epidemic that killed nearly 700,000 Brazilians, by undermining vaccination and containment efforts and peddling quack cures.Speaking on Sunday night, Bolsonaro promised to devote more time to convincing the poorest sectors of society they will be better off under a far-right government than a leftist one.The far-right leader said: “I understand there were a lot of votes (cast) because of the condition of the Brazilian people, who feel prices increases, especially basic products. I understand that a lot of people desire change but some changes can be for the worst.”“We tried to show this other side in the campaign but it seems like it didn’t register with the most important layers of society.”He once again said Brazil must avoid following neighbouring nations such as Chile and Colombia who recently elected leftist leaders but he pointedly refused to answer questions about possible voter fraud, after spending months casting aspersions on the security of the electronic voting machines.Bolsonaro has hinted he will not leave office if defeated, raising concerns of a Trump-like insurrection among his supporters if Lula wins.Prominent Bolsonaristas were elected to Brazil’s congress and as state governors, including Bolsonaro’s former health minister, Eduardo Pazuello, who became a congressman for Rio, and his former environment minister Ricardo Salles.Pazuello was Bolsonaro’s health minister during the height of the pandemic that led to more than 685,000 deaths in Brazil. A former military general, he promoted quack cures such as hydroxychloroquine.Salles, meanwhile, was the environment minister who presided over a sharp rise in Amazonian deforestation. A federal police investigation accused the far-right ideologue of making it difficult for environmental crimes to be investigated. A separate inquiry said he was linked to illegal logging exports. He denied all the charges.Rio’s Bolsonaro-supporting governor, Cláudio Castro, was re-elected while one of Bolsonaro’s most controversial former ministers, the evangelical preacher Damares Alves, claimed a place in the senate.Tarcísio de Freitas, Bolsonaro’s candidate for the governorship of São Paulo, also performed better than pollsters predicted and will face Lula ally Fernando Haddad in a second round.“The far-right will be thrilled,” said the political scientist Christian Lynch.Thiago Amparo, an academic and columnist for the Folha de São Paulo newspaper, said the right’s stronger-than-forecast showing showed Bolsonaro and Bolsonarismo were “alive and kicking”.“There was a feeling among the left that Lula had a chance to win in the first round … the results show that it was wishful thinking to imagine the election would serve as a way to punish Bolsonaro for his disastrous policies during the pandemic.”“I feel exhausted,” Amparo added. “But the results show we do not have the time to rest now. It is time to go out on to the streets … otherwise we are going to have a very dark future again.”“I think Bolsonaro has the momentum,” said Thomas Traumann, a Rio de Janeiro-based political observer, although he believed Lula was still the favourite. “It’s a very disappointing night for the left.”There was determination from Lula and his allies as the rightwing successes and the need for a second round became clear.“I think this is a chance that the Brazilian people are giving me,” said Lula before heading to a celebration with his supporters on São Paulo’s Paulista avenue. “The campaign begins tomorrow.”12:29‘Bolsonaro despises humanity’: the trans politician fighting for Brazil's future - video reportIn Rio de Janeiro’s city centre, a massive crowd of people, mostly clad in red, drank beer and danced samba as they awaited the final tally to appear on a screen overlooking the square.But the jubilant mood dampened when results showed Lula still nearly 2% shy of the majority he needed to avoid a runoff duel with Bolsonaro.“I’m disappointed,” said Kharine Gil, a 23-year-old university student. “Because we saw that Bolsonaro is stronger than we thought he was.”Elaine Azevedo, a 34-year-old security systems worker, looked defeated as she stared up at the towering screen showing the results.“I feel despair, pure despair,” said Azevedo, who was clad in red from head to toe and sported a hat with Lula’s name on it. “We all thought Lula would win easily.”But at a neighbourhood bar about a block away, Eudacio Queiroz Alves, a 65-year-old retired driver, was celebrating.“We expected this,” he said. “The people are with Bolsonaro.

84,"Brazil’s leftwing former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva appeared on the verge of a startling political comeback on Sunday as more than 156 million Brazilians took part in the country’s most important election in decades.As the veteran ex-president cast his vote in Brazil’s industrial heartlands on Sunday morning, Lula voiced optimism he was heading for victory over the far-right incumbent Jair Bolsonaro.“We want no more hatred, no more quarrelling, we want a country that lives in peace,” the 76-year-old told reporters in São Bernardo do Campo, the city where he began his legendary political career as a unionist in the 1970s.Polls on the eve of the election suggested Lula – who governed from 2003 to 2010 – was tantalisingly close to securing the overall majority of votes he needs to avoid a second-round runoff against Bolsonaro in late October. But by late on Sunday the election appeared to be heading for a run-off on October 30, as Bolsonaro’s strong initial showing seemed to have ended Lula’s hopes of a first-round victory.With 70% of votes counted, Lula was ahead with 45.74% compared to Bolsonaro’s 45.51% – although those numbers were expected to change as votes from traditionally pro-Lula regions were tallied.‘A day of hope’: Lula fans eager to see Bolsonaro defeatedRead moreA Lula victory would represent the latest in a series of triumphs for a resurgent Latin American left, following the election of leftist leaders in Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia and Chile.“I’m going to win these elections so I can give the people the right to be happy again.

A giant banner hung over the square by anti-Bolsonaro activists read: “Brazil has gotten worse”.“This didn’t exist 10 years ago … It’s like an improvised refugee camp,” Morais said.Brazilian president and re-election candidate Jair Bolsonaro arrives at a polling station to vote in Rio de Janeiro.

This nonsense has to stop,” he said. “Any Brazilian who votes for Bolsonaro has worms in their head.”Yet many citizens do continue to support the far-right radical, who has insisted he would win on Sunday despite all major polling firms predicting his defeat.A Bolsonaro supporter heads to the polls in Brasilia.

86,"An “ordinary” Chinese vase put up for auction in France and valued at €2,000 (£1,745) has sold for almost €8m after a ferocious bidding war among buyers convinced it was a rare 18th-century artefact.At the sale in Fontainebleau near Paris, auctioneers were astonished as the offers from about 30 mainly Chinese bidders kept on coming. When the hammer fell the vase had been sold for €7.7m – almost 4,000 times its estimated value. With the seller’s fees, the final purchase price was €9.12m.The tianqiuping-style porcelain was put in the auction by a woman living in a French overseas territory who was left it by her late mother. The unnamed seller had not seen the 54cm-tall vase, but arranged for it to be taken from her mother’s home in Brittany to Paris to be sold by auctioneers Osenat.She told the auction house expert the vase had originally belonged to her grandmother, a Parisian collector.Paris mansion’s contents at auction in house clearance par excellenceRead moreAlmost 30 would-be buyers competed in the bidding war.Jean-Pierre Osenat of the auctioneers said it was a “crazy story”. “The seller lives far away and didn’t even see the vase. She inherited it from her mother who in turn inherited it from her mother who was a big Paris collector in the last century,” Osenat said.Tianqiuping means “heavenly sphere” and denotes the shape of the vase, which was blue and white porcelain covered in enamel and decorated with dragons and clouds. The auction house said it dated from the 20th century and described it as “quite ordinary”. Had it been 200 years older it would have been extremely rare, their expert said.Cédric Laborde, a director at Osenat, said: “From the moment the catalogue was published we saw there was enormous interest with more and more Chinese people coming to see the vase. Our expert still thinks it’s not old.“The Chinese are passionate about their history and proud to take possession of their history.” He said the buyer was Chinese and he believed the vase would be put on display.",[{'name': 'Kim Willsher in Paris'}],‘Ordinary’ Chinese vase sells for almost €8m after ferocious bidding war
87,"Indonesian police are facing increasing pressure over their management of crowds during the Kanjuruhan stadium disaster, where at least 125 people, including dozens of children, were killed in a crush of fleeing spectators.Officers fired teargas in response to a pitch invasion by fans at the overcrowded stadium in Malang regency, East Java, on Saturday night, creating panic among supporters. Three witnesses told the Guardian teargas was fired not only at fans on the pitch but also at crowds who had remained in the stands, and that no warning was given.Huge numbers scrambled to escape, prompting a deadly rush in which many were suffocated or crushed. A further 323 people were injured, some of whom are in critical condition. At least 32 children were among those killed. The youngest was aged three or four, according to an official.“I held out in the stands even as the gas strangled my throat,” said one fan who struggled to leave because the exit was packed with people. In my 20 years as an [Arema fan], I have never felt as terrified as I did that night.”Fifa stadium safety guidance states that “crowd control gas” should not be carried or used by stewards or police inside stadiums.‘I felt terrified’: fans tell how Indonesian stadium disaster unfoldedRead moreIndonesia’s chief security minister, Mahfud MD, said on Monday an independent fact-finding team would be formed to investigate the disaster.Separately, a national police spokesperson, Dedy Prasetyo, said 18 officers responsible for firing teargas, ranging from middle- to high-ranking, were being investigated along with “internal matters related to security management”. Witnesses were being questioned and mobile phone and security camera footage examined, he added.Rights experts have demanded that any inquiry be fully impartial.Phil Robertson, the deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch, called for the president, Joko Widodo, to establish an independent investigation, and publicly report the findings.“All those responsible should be held accountable for this disaster, regardless of their status or position. It’s not enough for the national police and the Football Association of Indonesia to conduct their own investigation because they may be tempted to downplay or undermine full accountability for officials involved,” he said.Fifa should also conduct an investigation and issue a public report of its findings, Robertson added.Said Usman Hamid, the executive director of Amnesty International Indonesia, has also called for an inquiry, claiming “excessive force” had been used.Damaged vehicles in the Kanjuruhan stadium after the fatal crush. Photograph: Willy Kurniawan/ReutersEast Java’s police chief, Nico Afinta, defended the force’s response at a news conference on Sunday. He said other measures had been taken before teargas was used but that fans “began to attack the police, acting anarchically and burning vehicles”.A vigil was held outside the Kanjuruhan stadium on Sunday evening to remember the victims. Graffiti on the walls of the stadium revealed deep anger towards the authorities.“My siblings were killed. Investigate thoroughly,” read one message scrawled on the stadium’s shutters, accompanied by a black ribbon and the date of the tragedy, according to the news company Agence France-Presse. “ACAB”, an abbreviation for “all cops are bastards”, was sprayed on another wall.Funerals were also held for victims. “My family and I didn’t think it would turn out like this,” Endah Wahyuni told Reuters. Her two younger brothers, Ahmad Cahyo, 15, and Muhammad Farel, 14, were among those killed. “They loved soccer but never watched Arema live at Kanjuruhan stadium. This was their first time,” she said.Social media footage from inside the stadium showed chaotic scenes in which fans clambered to escape large amounts of teargas, some trying to carry other injured spectators to safety.Only fans of Arema, the home side, were allowed to watch Saturday night’s match. Fans of the opposing team, Persebaya Surabaya, who won, were banned as a precaution to prevent violence between the two sides.Indonesia has a long-running problem with football violence, fuelled by intense rivalry between teams. However previous incidents have not been anywhere near as deadly as Saturday’s tragedy, which is one of the worst sports stadium disasters ever.The Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, called the events “a dark day for all involved in football and a tragedy beyond comprehension”.

88,"One of China’s biggest and most divisive #MeToo cases, which had been set to play out with extraordinary transparency because of its US location and was closely watched by millions inside China, has been settled out of court.Liu Qiangdong, a 49-year-old online retail billionaire who also goes by Richard Liu and is known as China’s Jeff Bezos, had been accused of sexually assaulting a then 21-year-old Chinese graduate when she was studying at the University of Minnesota and he was visiting on a business trip. Liu has always denied the assault accusations, saying it was consensual.In 2019, Liu Jingyao – who is not related but shares a common name – launched civil proceedings against Liu, after prosecutors declined to pursue a criminal case. The case has been followed by Chinese people. But on the eve of the Minneapolis trial, lawyers for both parties announced they had reached a settlement. A settlement amount was not disclosed.“The incident between Ms Liu Jingyao and Mr Liu Richard in Minnesota in 2018 resulted in a misunderstanding that has consumed substantial public attention and brought profound suffering to the parties and their families,” it said.The shock announcement brought to a close a case that had captured the attention of Chinese citizens and media, aided by the US court system’s far more open access than the notoriously opaque Chinese court system.In 2018 Liu Jingyao claimed she had been at a dinner with Liu, the CEO of e-retail giant JD.com, and other executives, and was put under pressure to drink alcohol. She accused Liu of later forcing himself on her in a car when she was too intoxicated to resist, and then following her to her room and raping her. The next day she called police, who arrested Liu.The case made global headlines, but Liu denied wrongdoing and was released the next day. Prosecutors later declined to press charges citing “profound evidentiary problems”. In April the following year, Liu Jingyao launched civil proceedings against him.The accusations and pending civil suit, scheduled to begin on Monday, had divided opinions over the years. China’s #MeToo movement has struggled to gain traction in the fact of social stigma, official censorship, uneven power dynamics, and significant obstacles in victims getting their case before a court. In recent years unsuccessful accusations against high-profile men have appeared to undermine confidence in government pledges to improve the protection of women.Liu and his wife, a celebrity influencer, were famous and drew support in the face of the allegations. Chinese media reports had seized upon edited CCTV footage of the pair’s encounter, to discredit Liu Jingyao’s account and suggest that she had invited the executive to her room. She was subject to widespread accusations of seducing Liu, and lying in order to make money. There was also a debate over societal favouring of powerful elites, dangerous drinking cultures, and demands for a “perfect victim”.News of the settlement quickly spread across social media in China, with hundreds of millions of views of related hashtags on Weibo. “The public has seen the essence of the matter,” said one. “Money is all-powerful.”Some #MeToo supporters praised Liu Jingyao for continuing her fight for four years. “Every battle flag is precious,” said one.A group of Chinese women’s rights activists who had followed the case, sharing information with people in China, said the settlement was of great importance to the movement, and a “common victory”.“Jingyao decided this case had way more details to be revealed through the [legal] process and she was willing to take it to court,” said Gigi, a US-based member of the group.“It was thanks to the courage of her that we get to know so much more detail and do more public education and allow people to know more about one of the most high profile #MeToo cases in China … [and] to have the opportunity to maybe get a trial, where you can have tremendous open access to court documents on the website, which reveals so much of how those typical toxic drinking cultures and business cultures.“With so many #MeToo survivors coming forward, we can humanise the cases, we see them, and they don’t need to be the perfect victim. We have come a long way.”Liu Jingyao, who has previously told the New York Times she was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder following the alleged incident, on Sunday told the paper she was “OK”. “I didn’t make it to the end but that was all I could do,” the NYT reported her as saying.On Sunday, Liu released a statement. “I want to once again express my regrets to all those troubled by this incident, especially my wife, and I hope my life and work can return to normal as soon as possible,” he said.

89,"At least 125 people have been killed and around 320 injured at a football match in Indonesia in one of the world’s worst ever sports stadium disasters.Police used teargas in response to a pitch invasion by rioting fans, causing a crush among panicked spectators.Officers and organisers are facing scrutiny over the tragedy, including questions over the use of teargas inside the venue, which is contrary to Fifa guidance.The incident occurred after a match in which the Javanese club Arema were defeated by their rivals Persebaya Surabaya at Kanjuruhan stadium in Malang regency, East Java on Saturday night.Supporters from the losing side stormed the pitch and authorities fired teargas, leading to a crush and cases of suffocation, said East Java’s police chief, Nico Afinta. Two police officers were among the dead.Many people were crushed and suffocated when they ran to one exit, Afinta said.“They went out to one point at the exit, then there was a buildup – in the process of accumulation there was shortness of breath, lack of oxygen.”A hospital director told local TV that one victim was aged five.“The most terrible thing was when victims came to be treated by the team doctor,” said Arema coach Javier Roca. “About 20 people arrived and four died. Fans died in the arms of players.”Officials earlier said the death toll had been 174, but revised this figure down on Sunday evening, saying they had cross-referenced data from 10 hospitals. A further 320 people were injured.The Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, called the events “a dark day for all involved in football and a tragedy beyond comprehension”.“The football world is in a state of shock,” he said. Manchester United and Barcelona posted tributes online and other Spanish football clubs said they would hold a minute’s silence before their matches on Sunday.The Indonesian president, Joko Widodo, told authorities to thoroughly re-evaluate security at football matches and ordered the suspension of Liga 1 matches. Saturday’s events should be the “last soccer tragedy in the nation”, he said.Social media footage and images showed chaotic scenes in which fans clambered to escape thick clouds of teargas, some trying to carry other injured spectators to safety.Rights experts have demanded answers over the police response, pointing to Fifa stadium safety guidance that states that “crowd control gas” should not be carried or used by stewards or police around the perimeter of the field of play.Amnesty International’s executive director for Indonesia, Usman Hamid, said this loss of life “cannot go unanswered” and called on the authorities to “ensure that those who are found to have committed violations are tried in open court and do not merely receive internal or administrative sanctions”.Police and soldiers on the stadium’s pitch after teargas was fired. Photograph: Yudha Prabowo/APTeargas should only be used to disperse crowds when widespread violence had occurred and when other methods had failed, and people had to be warned of its use and allowed to disperse, Amnesty said.Questions have also been raised over why the venue was filled beyond its capacity. Indonesia’s chief security minister, Mahfud MD, said in an Instagram post on Sunday that 42,000 tickets had been issued for a stadium that holds a maximum of 38,000 people.East Java’s police chief, Nico Afinta, defended the force’s response at a news conference on Sunday. He said other measures had been taken before teargas was used but that fans “began to attack the police, acting anarchically and burning vehicles”.Local reports said as many as 3,000 spectators had stormed the pitch. Further clashes occurred outside the stadium, with vehicles, including a police truck, torched.Relatives waited anxiously for news about their loved ones at Malang’s Saiful Anwar general hospital. Others tried to identify the bodies at a morgue.At the Vatican, Pope Francis said he was praying for “all those who have lost their lives and were injured in the clashes”.A group of people carry a man in the stadium during the melee.

Will we return to banning supporters from attending the matches? That is what we will discuss.”MapPersebaya Surabaya fans were not allowed to buy tickets for the game due to fears of violence between fans of the longstanding rivals.Mahfud MD said organisers ignored the recommendation of authorities to hold the match in the afternoon instead of the evening.“This sport … often provokes supporters to express emotions suddenly,” he said on Instagram.Violence between football fans is a long-running problem in Indonesia.

90,"North Korea has fired two more ballistic missiles, South Korea’s military said, its fourth such launch this week as Seoul, Tokyo and Washington ramp up joint military drills.The launch early on Saturday came after the navies of South Korea, the United States and Japan staged trilateral anti-submarine exercises on Friday for the first time in five years, and the US vice-president, Kamala Harris, made a visit to the region this week.Harris was in Seoul on Thursday and toured the heavily fortified demilitarised zone that divides the peninsula, on a trip that aimed to underscore her country’s “ironclad” commitment to South Korea’s defence against the North.Kamala Harris hits out at North Korea’s ‘provocative nuclear rhetoric’ on DMZ visitRead moreWith inter-Korean talks long stalled, Pyongyang has doubled down on its banned weapons programmes, conducting a record-breaking blitz of tests this year and revising its laws to declare itself an “irreversible” nuclear power.South Korea’s military said it had “detected two short-range missiles between 0645 and 0703 fired from the Sunan area in Pyongyang into the East Sea”, referring to the body of water also known as the Sea of Japan.The missiles “flew approximately 350km at an altitude of 30km at speed of Mach 6”, Seoul’s joint chiefs of staff said in a statement, calling the launches “a serious provocation”.Tokyo also confirmed the launch, saying the missiles had landed outside Japan’s exclusive economic zones.Toshiro Ino, Japan’s vice defence minister, said the missiles “appear to have flown in irregular trajectories”.Experts say the irregular trajectories indicate the missiles are capable of manoeuvring in flight, making them harder to track and intercept.The US Indo-Pacific Command said in a statement that the latest launch “highlights the destabilising impact of the DPRK’s unlawful WMD and ballistic missile programs”, using the official abbreviation for North Korea.North Korea marked Harris’s trip to Seoul with a flurry of missile launches – firing off short-range ballistic missiles on Sunday, Wednesday and Thursday, including a few hours after the vice-president flew out of South Korea.Washington has about 28,500 troops stationed in South Korea to help protect it from the North.Under Seoul’s President Yoon Suk-yeol, who took office in May, the two countries have boosted joint exercises, which they insist are purely defensive.North Korea fires ballistic missile towards sea, says South Korean militaryRead moreJust before Harris arrived in Seoul, Washington sent the nuclear-powered USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier to South Korea to conduct a large-scale joint naval exercise.Such drills infuriate North Korea, which sees them as rehearsals for an invasion.“North Korea’s short-range ballistic tests are less important than a nuclear test but still violate UN security council resolutions,” said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul, adding that the timing was “provocative”.North Korea was “rapidly modernising weapons and taking advantage of a world divided by US-China rivalry and Russia’s annexation of more Ukrainian territory”, he said.South Korean and US officials have been warning for months that the North Korean ruler, Kim Jong-un, is preparing to conduct another nuclear test.On Wednesday, the South’s spy agency said North Korea’s next nuclear test could happen in the window between China’s upcoming party congress on 16 October and the US midterm elections on 7 November.North Korea, which is under multiple UN sanctions for its weapons programmes, typically seeks to maximise the geopolitical impact of its tests with careful timing.The isolated regime has tested nuclear weapons six times since 2006, most recently in 2017.",[{'name': 'Agencies'}],North Korea fires ballistic missiles in fourth launch in a week after naval drills
91,"Journalists at the BBC World Service have said plans to move its Vietnamese service from London to Thailand pose a danger to press freedom.Several reporters at the World Service raised concerns that the Vietnamese state had a history of abducting journalists from Thailand. They also suggested that BBC bosses failed to comprehend that just because both countries were in south-east Asia, it did not mean Vietnamese people were naturally at home in Thailand.“Being a critic of the Vietnamese government, even when you’re in Thailand, is not safe,” said one World Service employee. Journalists in Thailand have to annually submit their articles to the government to have their visas renewed.Journalists cannot operate freely in Vietnam, a one-party state controlled by the country’s Communist party. As a result, most of the BBC’s Vietnamese-language staff have traditionally operated out of London, in common with the majority of the World Service’s operations.A BBC spokesperson said: “The safety and security of our journalists is paramount. We are not proposing to open any new operations in Bangkok – for a number of years the Vietnamese service has been split between Bangkok and London, with half of the journalists based in Bangkok and half in London, all producing excellent and impartial journalism.”The relocation of the London-based Vietnamese team is one of a series of cost-saving measures announced on Thursday, which includes cutting almost 400 jobs to save the BBC about £28m a year. The Thai service will also move from London to Bangkok, the Korean service to Seoul, and the Bangla service to Dhaka.One employee said: “The BBC want to use the World Service as a token in the game about the licence fee with the government.”Bill Hayton, a former BBC Vietnam correspondent, said the relocation would result in a loss of institutional knowledge: “It’s about cost saving – you can hire people in Thailand on local rates. Vietnamese dissidents have been kidnapped in Bangkok by Vietnamese security forces and that must weigh on the heads of anyone doing Vietnamese journalism in Thailand. That presents a risk to BBC journalism, as well as the BBC journalists involved.”There is a tension within the BBC World Service: one viewpoint is that journalists should be based in the same countries as their audience, the other is that the purpose of the World Service is to provide global audiences with news from London.The BBC argues that it should focus on producing online content that reaches younger global audiences rather than trying to find ways to maintain its overseas radio and television output.The World Service was traditionally funded by the British government as a tool of soft power, but the cost was loaded on to British licence fee payers as part of George Osborne’s austerity measures. The government has since started providing some funding again but the latest cuts have raised concerns that the UK is ceding the foreign broadcast space to state-backed competitors, such as Russia’s RT and China’s CGTN.",[{'name': 'Jim Waterson Media editor'}],BBC accused of endangering World Service Vietnamese staff
92,"A lawyer for Australians trapped in Syrian detention camps say conditions are “volatile and unsafe” inside the camps as winter approaches, with interruptions to food and water supply, and the need for their repatriation growing increasingly urgent.Guardian Australia reported on Sunday that the government was preparing an operation to start repatriating more than 60 Australians – widows and children of slain or jailed Islamic State fighters – who are in the al-Hawl and Roj detention camps. About 20 are adults, many of whom say they were coerced or tricked into travelling to Syria by husbands who have since died.Most of the more than 40 children are under the age of six. Several were born in the detention camps.Between 20 and 30 people are expected to be repatriated initially, with subsequent operations expected in the coming months.

The conditions in the camps are horrible – poor sanitation, overcrowded, filthy and inhumane.“Children who lived under IS and women trafficked by IS should be treated first and foremost as victims. Others could be investigated and prosecuted under Australian law, which is at least some measure of accountability.”Australia to launch rescue mission for women and children trapped in Syrian detention campsRead moreThe chief executive of Save the Children Australia, Mat Tinkler, visited the camps in June and said he was encouraged by the reports of a repatriation plan.“For more than three years, these children have been trapped in one of the worst places in the world to be a child and their situation has been growing increasingly desperate,” he said.Tinkler rejected arguments repatriation was impractical or too dangerous.“That excuse was always rubbish,” he said, citing his own visit to Roj camp. “It’s not complicated. If a bloke from the west of Melbourne can get there on his own, then surely the Australian government, with all of its resources and capabilities, and the support of the US military, can.”He said it was in Australia’s national security interests to bring the women and children home sooner rather than later, and under government supervision and control, given as citizens they would ultimately have the right to return anyway.

Those aged between 10 and 14 in Victoria at the time of their alleged offending cannot be prosecuted if a court finds that principle is upheld.The court heard that a previous doli incapax report, completed by a different psychologist in July 2021 in relation to other alleged offending committed by the boy, found he did not have this capacity.Police had withdrawn the previous charges against the boy after receiving this report, the court heard.But the psychologist who completed the recent report found otherwise.She said that several factors, including his lack of appreciation of how his alleged offending harmed others, and his attempts to avoid self-incrimination and attitudes towards police, contributed to her findings.For example, she said, when he was questioned by police about a car theft and asked how he would feel if someone had stolen his car, he responded that they could take a bus.Sign up to Guardian Australia's Morning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing email breaks down the key national and international stories of the day and why they matterPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

94,"In Hervey Bay, Paul unwittingly switched on Sunday night’s NRL grand final 60 minutes after kick-off. The game he was watching had a half to go but the result had already been decided.Paul was among those suffering after Queensland’s reluctance to join much of the country in winding clocks forward an hour for the annual introduction of daylight savings.But the perennial debate has taken a turn, with Brisbane’s lord mayor, Adrian Schrinner, calling for a daylight savings trial, revisiting an issue he championed back in February on the 30th anniversary of the state’s failed referendum on making the change.It is a divisive issue which largely splits Queenslanders along geographic lines. Generally, rural and regional communities back the status quo that gives them light for early morning tasks and minimises work in the heat of the afternoon. But many in the south-east would relish extra sunlit evenings and find it easier to align with colleagues working in New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania.

Alongside jokes around confused cows and hungry dogs, proponents for and against a change make scientific claims to back to their arguments, citing impacts on circadian rhythms, skin cancer rates and even road tolls for native wildlife.But on Sunday, Schrinner gathered an assortment of Brisbane’s business and cultural figures to made an economic pitch for change.The mayor claimed not having daylight savings was costing Queenslanders $4bn in lost productivity every year, adding it would “deliver a bonanza for local businesses”.Should we abolish daylight saving time – or apply it across Australia? Read moreWithout daylight savings, first light in Queensland can occur as early as 4.15am during the summer months.“Who is spending money at the moment at 4.45am, not many people,” Schrinner said.“If you shifted that opportunity to the evening, you will get massive lifestyle and economic benefits. We’re letting good daylight hours go to waste.”Queenslanders voted against permanently introducing daylight savings after a three-year trial back in 1992 – 54.5% voted against daylight savings and 45.5% voted in favour.Sign up to Guardian Australia's Morning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing email breaks down the key national and international stories of the day and why they matterPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The unveiling of the plan came as the government committed to investing up to $675m for a new hospital in west Gippsland if re-elected at the November election.Paul Gilbert, the assistant secretary of the Victorian branch of the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation, said violence and aggression occurred across the health sector but that the scheme would only provide about 3.5 PSOs for each shift across five hospitals.‘No health workers want to stand with us’: the challenge for Victoria’s Coalition Read more“It may provide support for Victoria Police, but it will not work as a health response,” Gilbert said.Matthew Guy said a Coalition government would commit to ensuring all healthcare workers were safe from abuse and violence.“The safe workspace for our health care workers at this point in time is part of my plan to fix the hospital system,” the opposition leader said.A parliamentary inquiry in 2011 recommended that PSOs not be employed in Victorian hospitals due to it being an “inappropriate” measure that was “contrary to the good management of security in hospitals” and posed a greater safety risk.Hospital staff told the inquiry they had concerns that the presence of armed guards would increase, rather than decrease, the potential for violence.Gilbert said “best practice” was already happening with unarmed security guards – who have undertaken healthcare context training – employed by hospitals“We don’t need headlines about adding guns to our health services, we need leadership on the further work required by hospital managements to implement strong internal workplace systems,” he said.The Australasian College of Emergency Medicine said the proposal could decrease safety in emergency departments.“However, instead of PSOs, the college advises the employment of security guards, embedded in ED,” the peak body said. “These security guards would receive specialised training and would provide compassionate, patient-centred, trauma-informed care.”On Monday Daniel Andrews said the none of five hospitals included in the trial had requested PSO protection and said the feedback from the health sector had been around workforce shortages. Andrews also took a swipe at the opposition for returning to a 2010 policy it had “junked” in 2011.The opposition’s health spokesperson, Georgie Crozier, said the party had not “directly consulted” the five hospitals but stressed that as a former nurse, he had first-hand experience of physical workplace abuse.Sign up to Guardian Australia's Morning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing email breaks down the key national and international stories of the day and why they matterPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

97,"Russia has put Marina Ovsyannikova, the former state TV editor who interrupted a news broadcast to protest against the Ukraine war, on a wanted list after she reportedly escaped house arrest.The Ukrainian-born Ovsyannikova, 44, gained international attention in March after bursting into a studio of Channel One, her then employer, to denounce the Ukraine war during a live news bulletin, holding a poster reading “no war”. At the time she was fined 30,000 roubles (£460) for shunning protest laws.Ovsyannikova continued protesting against the war and was charged in August with spreading false information about the Russian army for holding up a poster that read “Putin is a murderer, his soldiers are fascists” during a solo protest on the Moskva River embankment opposite the Kremlin. She was subsequently placed under house arrest to await trial and was facing up to 10 years in prison if found guilty.00:17Anti-war protester interrupts Russian news broadcast – video On Saturday, Ovsyannikova’s ex-husband said she had escaped house arrest together with her young daughter.“Last night, my ex-wife left the place that the court assigned her, and disappeared with my 11-year-old daughter in an unknown direction,” Igor Ovsyannikov, who is employed at the state-run news outlet RT, said.Ovsyannikova’s whereabouts are unknown and she did not immediately respond to a request for comment. On Monday, she was added to the interior ministry’s online list of fugitives, accompanied by a photo.Since the start of the war in Ukraine, Russia has launched an unprecedented crackdown on protesters, independent news outlets and foreign social media networks. In early March, the president, Vladimir Putin, signed off on a draconian law imposing a jail term of up to 15 years for spreading intentionally “fake” news about the military, in effect criminalising any public criticism of the war.Hundreds of leading Russian independent journalists and activists have fled the country, fearing a wave of government repression. But the war in Ukraine also resulted in a steady stream of resignations from Russia’s tightly controlled state-run television channels.Last month, Zhanna Agalakova, a former Channel One newsreader who at the time of her resignation in March was the station’s correspondent in Paris, announced she was returning the two state medals she received from Putin for her work at the channel.“Mr President, your leadership is leading the country to the abyss,” Agalakova said in a handwritten note posted on her Facebook page. “I consider your awards unacceptable.”",[{'name': 'Pjotr Sauer'}],Russian woman behind on-air war protest reportedly escapes house arrest
98,"Russia no longer has full control of any of the four provinces of Ukraine it says it annexed last week after Ukrainian troops reportedly advanced dozens of kilometres in Kherson province in the south of the country and made additional gains in the east.On Monday the Russian military acknowledged that Kyiv’s forces had broken through in the Kherson region. It said the Ukrainian army and its “superior tank units” had managed to “penetrate the depths of our defence” around the villages of Zoltaya Balka and Alexsandrovka.MapThe ministry of defence spokesperson Igor Konashenkov said Russian troops had occupied what he called a “pre-prepared defensive line”. They continued to “inflict massive fire damage” on Ukrainian forces, he claimed.His comments are an admission that Ukraine’s southern counter-offensive is dramatically gaining pace, two months after it began. Ukrainian brigades appear to have achieved their biggest breakthrough in the region since the war started, bursting through the frontline and advancing rapidly along the Dnieper River.Kyiv gave no official confirmation of the gains. Russian sources acknowledged that the Ukrainian tank offensive had moved along the river’s west bank, recapturing a number of villages along the way, and threatening the supply lines for thousands of marooned Russian troops.Speaking overnight, Zelenskiy said Ukraine’s 129th brigade from his home city of Kryvyi Rih had liberated the settlements of Arkhanhelske and Myrolyubivka in the northern Kherson region. The brigade’s soldiers flew a blue and yellow flag in Myrolyubivka from a shell-damaged roof.Russian military bloggers suggested Ukraine’s advance was spectacular. They claimed Kyiv’s troops were now close to Dudchany, about 20 miles (30km) south of where the front stood before the breakthrough, indicating one of the fastest advances of the war.Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s interior ministry, posted a photo of Ukrainian soldiers posing with their flag draping a golden statue of an angel. He said it was the village of Mikhailivka, about 20km beyond their previous position. The next apparent Ukrainian target was the city of Beryslav, on the banks of the Dnieper.In his latest address, Zelenskiy dismissed as a “farce” Russia’s annexation of Ukrainian territory, which includes Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk and Luhansk provinces. Declining to mention Vladimir Putin by name, he said “someone somewhere” had recently held what he called “pseudo-referendums”.“When the Ukrainian flag is returned, no one remembers the Russian farce with some pieces of paper,” Zelensky said. “Except, of course, the law enforcement agencies of Ukraine. Because everyone who is involved in any elements of aggression against our state will be accountable for it.”On Friday Putin held a grand signing ceremony in the Kremlin with the four Russian-picked “leaders” of the occupied Ukrainian regions. He declared the territories were Russia’s “for ever” and said he would use “all available means” to defend them – an apparent reference to nuclear weapons.But the Kremlin’s strategy quickly unravelled in the face of embarrassing defeats on the battlefield and confusion as to where Russia’s new international “borders” actually were. Over the weekend Ukrainian troops recaptured the city of Lyman in Donetsk oblast – in theory a part of Russia.On Monday Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, failed to clarify the issue when he said: “We will continue to consult with the people who live in these areas.” This appeared to be a face-saving formula in the event – as seems likely – of further Russian military setbacks in the coming days and weeks.In the eastern Donbas local separatist leaders acknowledged that Ukraine’s army had now crossed the administrative borders of Luhansk province, advancing from Lyman. Russia only controls around a half of Donetsk oblast. It is going backwards, seven months into Putin’s full-scale invasion.In the eastern city of Sloviansk there was evidence of the recent battles and continuing offensive as captured Russian armour was towed into the city. The fall of Lyman has opened the way for Ukrainian forces to advance deep into Luhansk province, threatening the main supply routes to territory Moscow captured in some of the war’s bloodiest battles in June and July.Observers in Kyiv were cautious on Monday about the scale of Ukrainian gains in the south. They said continuous battles were going on across a flat steppe landscape. Russian troops were using tanks, mortars, and jets to fire at Ukrainian positions and were making extensive use of drones. They were trying to repair bridges across the Dnieper destroyed by Ukrainian missile strikes.The deputy head of Russia’s puppet administration in the Kherson region, Kirill Stremousov, acknowledged the Ukrainian army was going forward. But he added that “everything is under control”. He recorded a video standing next to a reed-lined riverbank, with Kherson’s Antonivskyi Bridge visible behind him.Stremousov said: “We are on the ground and continue to take care of the citizens of the Russian Federation of the Kherson region. We are now Russia and everything will be fine.”mapSpeaking on Russian TV, his boss, Vladimir Saldo, admitted things were not entirely going to plan. “It’s tense, let’s put it that way,” he said. Saldo took part in Friday’s ceremony in the Kremlin, shaking hands with Putin. On Monday the Duma rubber-stamped the “annexation treaty”.Zelenskiy’s senior advisers have humorously pointed out the absurdity and surrealism of Russia “annexing” territory, while at the same time losing control of it. Oleksiy Arestovych tweeted on Monday that “more and more settlements” were “rapidly withdrawing from the Russian Federation”. He added: “Now in the Kherson direction.”Russia currently occupies only about 30% of the Zaporizhzhia region. This includes Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant but not Zaporizhzhia city, the main urban centre. Social media channels suggested Russian troops have recently stopped civilians from leaving via a crossing point to Ukrainian government-run territory, with hundreds of cars stuck.In the north-east of the country Ukraine was close to liberating all of the Kharkiv region after a counter-offensive which began last month. The Russian frontline is in the east of the oblast not far from the town of Kupiansk. It was said to be collapsing. Ukrainian troops liberated several villages including Shyykivka.They were reportedly moving east and along the right-bank of the Oskil River towards the border with Luhansk oblast and the city of Svatove. One unverified report said Russian soldiers had abandoned their positions in a large forest area without a fight, and were fleeing.The International Atomic Energy Agency said Russia had freed the head of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station. Ihor Murashov disappeared on Friday while on his way to work at the plant, which Russian troops have occupied since March. A Russian patrol abducted him.The Kremlin has been coercing Ukrainian employees to sign new contracts with Rosatom, its state nuclear agency. The IAEA says it had received confirmation Murashov “had returned to his family safely”.Russia still occupies about 15% of Ukraine, including Crimea. But since September the Ukrainians have reclaimed large chunks of land, via twin counter-offensives in the north-east and south. It remains to be seen if Russia’s mass mobilisation at home will change this equation.","[{'name': 'Luke Harding and Isobel Koshiw in Kyiv, and Peter Beaumont in Sloviansk'}]",Russia no longer has full control of any of four ‘annexed’ Ukrainian provinces
99,"A Swedish geneticist has been awarded the 2022 Nobel prize in physiology or medicine.Svante Pääbo won the 10m Swedish kronor (£867,000) prize announced on Monday by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm.Pääbo won for his discoveries concerning the genomes of extinct hominins including Neanderthals and human evolution, according to the formal citation from the Nobel committee.His discoveries also have implications for modern medicine. Chunks of Neanderthal and Denisovan DNA are peppered throughout the human genome and their analysis is beginning to shed light on what makes our physiology unique, or similar, to that of our ancestors.For instance, a Denisovan version of the gene EPAS1 has been found to help people survive at high altitudes and is common among modern-day Tibetans. Neanderthal genes have also been identified that affect our immune responses to different types of infections, including the risk of severe Covid-19. Humans have long been intrigued by our origins and how we relate to the extinct human species that came before us. Through sequencing the Neanderthal genome and developing techniques that allowed DNA from other ancient specimens to be recovered and analysed, Pääbo’s discoveries have paved the way for a better understanding of what makes us uniquely human.Although the first Neanderthal skeleton was discovered in Germany in 1856, before the invention of DNA sequencing, studies of human evolution were limited to comparisons of the size and shape of such bones, and examining tools and other archeological artefacts related to them.Pääbo is a director at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany. From an early age he was fascinated by ancient human history and Egyptology.After graduating from medical school, Pääbo worked on a secret side-project aiming to isolate DNA from mummy specimens. Although he partly succeeded, he quickly realised that doing so was fraught with technical challenges because ancient DNA is heavily degraded and contaminated with DNA from bacteria and modern humans.Pääbo set about developing new techniques to study it, including turning to DNA from mitochondria – cellular organelles that contain thousands of copies of their own small pieces of DNA. With his refined methods, Pääbo managed to sequence a region of mitochondrial DNA from a 40,000-year-old piece of bone. Comparisons with contemporary humans and chimpanzees demonstrated that Neanderthals were genetically distinct.Yet mitochondrial DNA is limited in the information it can provide, and Pääbo’s ultimate goal was to sequence a full Neanderthal genome. He succeeded in 2010, with comparative analyses revealing that the most recent common ancestor of Neanderthals and Homo sapiens lived about 800,000 years ago.By studying DNA sequences from a small piece of bone discovered in a cave in Siberia, Pääbo also discovered the Denisovans, a previously unknown hominin group distantly related to Neanderthals.Such discoveries have created a fuller understanding of evolutionary history. At the time when Homo sapiens migrated out of Africa, at least two extinct hominin populations inhabited Eurasia: Neanderthals in western Eurasia, and Denisovans in the eastern parts of the continent. As Homo sapiens migrated out of Africa, they encountered and interbred with both groups.“Svante Pääbo’s groundbreaking discoveries allow us to address one of the most fundamental questions of all: what makes us unique?” said the Nobel committee member Anna Wedell. “Like us, Neanderthals had big brains. They lived in groups and they used tools, but these changed very little during hundreds of thousands of years, until [they] disappeared.“Homo sapiens, on the other hand, rapidly developed complex cultures, figurative art and advanced innovations. They crossed open waters and they spread to all parts of our planet. The basis for this dramatic development must lie in genetic changes that occurred after we separated from Neanderthals and Denisovans.“Thanks to his seminal discoveries, genetic variants that are shared among all now living humans, but absent in Neanderthals and Denisovans, have been identified. The list of such genetic variants is not very long, and understanding their functional implications is a focus of intense research.” ",[{'name': 'Linda Geddes Science correspondent'}],Swedish geneticist wins Nobel prize for Neanderthal research

Let’s just say that we are removing some of the friction,” Grégoire said.An area of 54 hectares (133 acres) around the tower, crisscrossed by several roads, will be largely turned over to pedestrians and “low-impact transportation” such as bus and bike lanes.City authorities are aiming to finish as much as possible for the start of the Paris Olympic Games in 2024.An estimated 150,000 people visit the tower site every day during the summer high season, including the 20,000 to 30,000 who climb it.Overall, 7 million people visit the tower each year.Campaigners were delighted the plans for new buildings had been dropped and the trees saved. “We’re satisfied for now but we remain vigilant,” said Thomas Brail from the National Surveillance Group for Trees (GNSA), which was part of a coalition of groups opposed to the plans.",[{'name': 'Agence France-Presse in Paris'}],Paris abandons plans for new buildings at foot of Eiffel Tower after uproar
101,"The UK and continental Europe have been hit by an “unprecedented” number of cases of avian flu this summer, with 47.7m birds having been culled since last autumn, according to new figures.Poultry producers from as far north as Norway’s Svalbard islands to southern Portugal have together reported almost 2,500 outbreaks of the disease since last year.There have also been thousands of outbreaks recorded in wild birds, according to the latest update from the EU’s European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, European Food Safety Authority and the EU reference laboratory. The virus reached breeding colonies of sea birds on the north Atlantic coast, killing huge numbers.In past years, outbreaks of avian flu declined with warmer weather and the end of migration by wild birds in the autumn and winter.But outbreaks have continued across the UK and elsewhere in Europe this summer leading to fears that highly pathogenic variants of avian flu are now endemic in wild birds, creating a risk of infection all year.From June to September, the number of outbreaks in domesticated birds was more than five times higher than the same period last year. Experts say all kinds of bird species have become infected now, causing the virus to remain.Outbreaks have also crossed the Atlantic Ocean, spreading from Europe to North America along migration routes and leading to millions of poultry being culled in the US and Canada.‘Unstoppable’ bird flu epidemic causes growing alarm among Dutch farmers Read moreDisease experts say outbreaks could get even worse this winter. “As autumn migration begins and the number of wild birds wintering in Europe increases, they are likely at higher risk of HPAI [highly pathogenic avian influenza] infection than previous years due to the observed persistence of the virus in Europe”, said Guilhem de Seze, head of risk assessment at the European Food Safety Authority.Year-round infections in the UK and Europe could force free-range chickens to be housed indoors.Veterinary trials to test bird flu vaccines have started in France and the Netherlands, but there are question marks around the effectiveness of vaccinations against avian flu and whether vaccinated birds can still spread the disease if they are infected.The European Commission has said it wants to allow eggs produced in the EU to be labelled as “free range” even if birds are kept inside.Sign up for the Animals farmed monthly update to get a roundup of the biggest farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

Shares were down 9% on Monday morning.The interest rate charged on Credit Suisse credit default swaps – insurance against the bank defaulting on its borrowings – spiked 6 basis points to 2.47% on Friday, the highest level in 10 years, as market players continued to lose confidence in the bank. The swaps began the year costing 0.57%.Shares in the bank rose 3.87% to close at 3.98 Swiss francs (£3.64) on Friday, but the uptick did nothing to quell market speculation about the company’s dire financial position.Credit Suisse weighs up 5,000 job cuts as part of restructuring planRead moreIt comes as Credit Suisse prepares to reveal a plan to get itself out of its financial hole, which may include job cuts, selling assets and asking investors for a fresh infusion of cash, on 27 October.“I trust that you are not confusing our day-to-day stock price performance with the strong capital base and liquidity position of the bank,” Körner said in the staff memo on Friday.“We are in the process of reshaping Credit Suisse for a long-term, sustainable future – with significant potential for value creation.“Given the deep franchise we have, with a longstanding focus on serving some of the world’s most successful entrepreneurs, I am confident we have what it takes to succeed.”Credit Suisse is among 30 “globally significant banks” listed by the central banks’ bank, the Bank Of International Settlements, that are required to set aside extra capital to absorb potential losses because of their importance to the international financial system.The bank plunged from a profit of 2.7bn francs (£2.47bn) in 2020 to a loss of 1.65bn francs (£1.51bn) last year, driven mostly by big losses on its investments in failed supply chain finance group Greensill and hedge fund Archegos – where US authorities have charged founder Bill Hwang and three others with racketeering and fraud offences after its collapse.Sign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to the all the business news and analysis you need every morningPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

103,"Iranian students have stepped up their protests in defiance of a crackdown by security forces, who allegedly cornered and shot 12 students at a prestigious university in Tehran on Sunday night.Anti-government protests ignited by the death of a young woman in police custody in mid-September have spread around the country at various levels of intensity, revealing a cultural chasm between the country’s educated youth and an elderly male religious establishment.In his first remarks on the protests, the supreme leader, Ali Khamenei gave strong backing to security forces and accused the US and Israel – the Islamic Republic’s arch-adversaries – of orchestrating the disturbances. “If there had been no issue of the young woman’s death, they would have used another pretext to stir up unrest and riots at this time,” Khamenei said.Concern has grown over the latest violence at Tehran’s Sharif University of Technology where, local media reported, riot police confronted hundreds of students, with officers using teargas and paintball guns and carrying non-lethal steel pellet guns. Many students were arrested and taken away in police cars or ambulances, as parents and others came to rescue them.“Woman, life, liberty,” students shouted, as well as “students prefer death to humiliation”, Mehr news agency reported, adding that Iran’s science minister, Mohammad Ali Zolfigol, came to speak to the students in a bid to calm the situation.The Oslo-based group Iran Human Rights posted video apparently showing Iranian police on motorcycles pursuing students running through an underground car park and, in a separate clip, taking away detainees whose heads were covered in black cloth bags.In other footage, which has not been independently verified, shooting and screaming can be heard as large numbers of people run down a street at night. In one clip, which IHR said was taken at a Tehran metro station, a crowd can be heard chanting: “Don’t be afraid! Don’t be afraid! We are all together!”The New York-based Center for Human Rights in Iran said it was “extremely concerned by videos coming out of Sharif University and Tehran today showing violent repression of protests and detainees being hauled away with their heads completely covered in fabric”.Iran’s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, told army cadets in Tehran on Monday that the US and Israel were responsible for the protests. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty ImagesCyber-attacks on the websites of government institutions including the judiciary were continuing on Monday, as reports emerged of lawyers being rounded up and arrested. Nevertheless students were out in force in large numbers again in Tehran and Isfahan. Despite efforts by the Iranian authorities to prevent students using social media to tell the world about the protests, pictures showed large crowds gathering.“Hard to bear what is happening at Sharif University in Iran,” the German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, tweeted on Monday. “The courage of the Iranians is incredible. And the regime’s brute force is an expression of sheer fear of the power of education and freedom.”Meenna, a female university student, said: “We are passing through the worst form of violence from the police. We will not tolerate their restrictions and not adhere to the regime’s strict dress code. It is our lives, and we have the right of choice.“I have seen dead bodies on the streets and roads and we will not let their blood be wasted. The future of students under this regime is targeting, committing violence and killing with pellet rounds and straight fires; our future is bleak under this regime, we will fight against them.”Education trade union leaders called for a nationwide strike by teachers and students in response to Sunday’s violence.Security forces and politicians appeared to believe that they have public support for a crackdown, but risk antagonising a fatalistic or cowed older middle-class. Many of the older middle-class, schooled in previous defeats for protesters and ground down by economic sanctions, have been holding back from participating in the recent protests because they see no point in trying to force the government to change its thinking.A session of the Iranian parliament on Sunday showed little willingness to compromise over the compulsory hijab or the methods of the Iranian morality police, the two main causes of the protests.The focus was instead on the role of overseas media and agents, as well as Iranian celebrities, in allegedly fomenting the protests. The Iranian foreign ministry said it had sent serious warnings to some countries that they were hosting “factories of lies”, a reference to the widely watched news outlets broadcasting into Iran.The protests began in response to the death in custody of the 22-year-old Kurdish Iranian woman Mahsa Amini, who had been detained for allegedly breaching strict dress code rules.A group of female prisoners in Tehran’s Evin prison issued a statement of support for the students. “Our hearts, our cries and our fists are with the hearts and cries of the people every moment,” they said. Former footballers also continued to back the protesters, including Mehdi Mahdavikia, the Asian footballer of the year in 2003, who wrote on social media: “For several decades, by suppressing students and beating them at every opportunity, you have made Iran’s elites and national capital flee. Important posts are in the hands of illiterate people.”Ali Karimi, capped for Iran’s football team 127 times, has also backed the protesters.Agence France-Presse contributed to this report",[{'name': 'Patrick Wintour and Haroon Janjua'}],Iranian students defy security forces after violence at university
104,"Iranian security forces have clashed with students at a prominent university in Tehran, social and state media reported, in the latest sign of a deadly clampdown on nationwide protests that were ignited by the death in custody of a young woman.The anti-government protests, which began at 22-year-old Mahsa Amini’s funeral on 17 September in the Kurdish town of Saqez, have spiralled into the biggest show of opposition to Iran’s authorities in years, with many calling for the end of more than four decades of Islamic clerical rule.Activist Twitter account 1500tasvir, which has about 160,000 followers, posted several videos showing Sharif University, traditionally a hotbed of dissent, surrounded by dozens of riot police on Sunday.‘Women, life, liberty’: Iranian civil rights protests spread worldwideRead moreOne of the videos showed security forces firing teargas to drive the students off the campus and the sound of what appeared to be shooting at a distance could be heard.Another video showed security forces chasing dozens of students trapped in the university’s underground parking. The account said dozens of students had been arrested.Iranian state media described “reports of clashes” at the university and said the country’s science minister visited the campus to check on the situation.Reuters could not independently verify the events at the university.Students had been protesting at numerous universities on Sunday and demonstrations were held in several cities such as Tehran, Yazd, Kermanshah, Sanandaj, Shiraz and Mashhad, with participants chanting “independence, freedom, death to Khamenei,” earlier social media posts showed.The protests have not abated despite a growing death toll and the crackdown by security forces using teargas, clubs, and in some cases, according to videos on social media and rights groups, live ammunition.Iran Human Rights, a Norway-based group, in a statement said that “so far 133 people had been killed across Iran“, including more than 40 people it said died in clashes last week in Zahedan, capital of the south-eastern Sistan-Baluchistan province.Iranian authorities have not given a death toll, while saying many members of the security forces have been killed by “rioters and thugs backed by foreign foes“. Last week state television said 41 had died, including members of the security forces.Iran’s utmost authority Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has not commented on the nationwide protests, which have spread to Iran’s 31 provinces, with all layers of society, including ethnic and religious minorities, taking part.Amini’s death and the crackdown have drawn international criticism of Iran’s rulers, who in turn accuse the United States and some European countries of exploiting the unrest to try to destabilise the Islamic Republic.Iranian state media shared a video of pro-government students, who gathered at the Ferdowsi university in Mashhad, chanting “the Islamic Republic is our red line”.Earlier on Sunday, Iranian lawmakers chanted “thank you, police” during a parliament session, in a show of support for a crackdown on widespread anti-government protests.Amini was arrested on 13 September in Tehran for “unsuitable attire” by the morality police who enforce the Islamic Republic’s strict dress code. She died three days later in hospital after falling into a coma.The lawyer for Amini’s family, Saleh Nikbakht, told the semi-official Etemadonline news website that “respectable doctors” believe she was hit in custody. Amini’s autopsy report and other medical details have not been released, but her father said he saw bruises on her leg and that other women detained with her said she was beaten.Iran’s police authorities say Amini died of a heart attack and deny she was beaten to death in custody.The country’s hardline president Ebrahim Raisi has ordered an investigation into Amini’s death. He said last week that a forensic report would be presented in “coming days”.Amnesty International on Friday reported that hundreds were injured and thousands have been arrested in the protests.State media said at least 20 people were killed in the Zahedan clashes, blaming a separatist group from the Baluchi minority for starting a shootout in the city.",[{'name': 'Reuters'}],Iran protests: riot police use teargas on students at Sharif university
105,"A former ADF Special Operations intelligence analyst who is now an expert on countering violent extremism says Australian children brought out of Syrian refugee camps will require intensive support to successfully integrate into the community.“It’s a long, intensive and individualised process but, done holistically, will have excellent results,” Shane Healey said. “Australia has the capability and the expertise to support these children.”Guardian Australia revealed on Sunday that the Australian government was preparing a repatriation operation to extract selected families out of the hostile camps in north-east Syria.Australia failing its own citizens held in ‘sordid’ camps in Syria, UN experts sayRead moreMore than 60 Australians – widows and children of slain or jailed Islamic State fighters – remain held within the al-Hawl and Roj detention camps. Many of the women say they were coerced, tricked, or forced into travelling to Syria by husbands who have since died.There are more than 40 children within the Australian cohort, the majority aged under six. Several were born in the detention camps and know no life outside.The initial Australian mission will not be able to bring the entire cohort out of the camps. Subsequent operations are expected in the coming months.

Healey, a veteran of more than 15 years in Australian Special Operations who served multiple deployments across the Middle East, said the children brought from the camps, after being held for years in difficult and dangerous conditions, would need a comprehensive support program “wrapped around them”.In June this year, the Commonwealth Secretariat launched a guide to managing the reintegration of violent extremists and their families, written by Australian Peta Lowe.The guide emphasises the need for community engagement and social inclusion for successful reintegration. “Every individual’s circumstances and challenges are different and distinctive,” it states.Healey said Australia had a moral obligation to extract the Australian women and children from the camps. “I don’t think any child should be growing up in that environment.”Healey said the “significant Islamic State organisation” within the camps posed an ongoing danger, particularly to children.“IS is thriving in the camps. That ideology is everywhere. Those children are still living in that bubble, they are being held in that world.”‘This is where they are being moulded’He said children were spending vital, formative years in violent and dangerous camps.“This is where they are being moulded. This is their formative time, you get your core values from your childhood. What you learn so young is deeply embedded,” Healey said. “It’s not the kids’ fault, they didn’t choose to be there.”Healey said the government could establish an Australian-run and controlled centre in a Middle Eastern country where the children could be moved for medical and security checks, and to undertake reintegration and education programs, for several months, even a year, before they move back to Australia.He said the country had world-leading countering violent extremism experts able to assist the Australians brought out of the camps.“We’re strong on terrorism, and on protecting Australians. This doesn’t undermine that, we are talking about Australian kids.”Other countries with nationals inside the Syrian camps have been steadily repatriating their citizens.Sign up to Guardian Australia's Morning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing email breaks down the key national and international stories of the day and why they matterPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There are people who have been doing this a long time, it’s a well-beaten path.”Sources internationally have confirmed to the Guardian that preparations are under way for the Australian government’s rescue mission, said to be imminent.Sydney teen Yusuf Zahab believed to have died in IS attack on Syrian jail after begging Australia for helpRead moreThe majority of Australians – including 44 children – are held in the Roj camp, closer to the Iraqi border and which is considered safer than al-Hawl, but where malnutrition, illness and violence are common.Al-Hawl, where one Australian family group and several children with a right to Australian citizenship are held, is considered exceedingly dangerous, with a rampant IS organisation, and where more than 100 murders were reported in the 18 months to June this year.A security operation by the Syrian Democratic Forces last month arrested more than 300 IS operatives inside al-Hawl, seized weapons and liberated at least six women found hidden and chained inside the camp, and who had been tortured by Islamic State over years.Australian children have suffered acutely in detention in Syria.The family of Sydney-born teenager Yusuf Zahab was told in July that he had died of uncertain causes. He was 11 years old when he was taken to Syria. He had previously contracted tuberculosis and had sent desperate pleas for help during an IS siege of al-Sina’a prison, in al-Hasakah, in January 2022.In 2021, an 11-year-old Australian girl collapsed due to malnutrition in al-Roj camp. And in 2020, a three-year-old Australian girl suffered severe frostbite to her fingers during a bitterly cold winter.Peter Maurer, president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, said already “appallingly harsh conditions” in al-Hawl were growing worse.“The children here have less food, clean water, healthcare and education than international standards call for. They are endlessly exposed to dangers, and their rights are ignored.

106,"The Biden administration is seeking a 45-day delay in a court proceeding in which it has been asked by a US judge whether it believes Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman should be granted sovereign immunity in a case involving the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi.Representatives from the US justice department said in a legal notice filed on Friday that the department was seeking the extension after Saudi Arabia announced in a press release last week that Prince Mohammed had been named prime minister.Critics of the Saudi government said they believed the new designation was a manoeuvre designed to try to establish sovereign immunity protection for the 37-year-old prince, who is facing a civil case in the US for his alleged role in the murder of Khashoggi.The legal case, which is being heard in a district court in Washington DC, has been filed against Prince Mohammed by Hatice Cengiz, Khashoggi’s fiancee, and Dawn, a pro-democracy group founded by the journalist before he was killed.The case has put the Biden administration in a legal and diplomatic bind.The US president entered the White House promising to make the crown prince accountable for Khashoggi’s murder and to make him a “pariah”. But Biden has largely abandoned that pledge in favour of pursuing other political and foreign policy objectives. In a trip to Jeddah this summer, the president fist-bumped the crown prince even after his own administration released a declassified intelligence briefing last year that concluded Prince Mohammed had likely ordered the Khashoggi killing.Prince Mohammed fist bumps Joe Biden at Al Salman Palace, July 2022. Photograph: Bandar Algaloud/ReutersPrince Mohammed has said he has taken responsibility for the murder but that he did not order the killing.The administration is not formally a party to the case, but was invited to weigh in on the matter. It had been given until 3 October by a judge hearing the Khashoggi case to respond to a series of legal questions about whether Prince Mohammed should be granted legal immunity, which traditionally is granted to a state’s ruler, like a prime minister, president or king.In its two-page filing on Friday, the Biden administration acknowledged it needed more time after already being granted an extension to settle the issue because of Prince Mohammed’s recent elevation to the role of prime minister.“In light of these changed circumstances, the United States requests a second extension of time of 45 days to prepare its response to the Court’s invitation,” the administration said in a notice to the court. “The United States appreciates the Court’s patience and consideration in this matter.” Legal experts who have studied the issue say they believe Cengiz’s legal team will likely challenge any legal argument that calls for Prince Mohammed to be granted immunity. Among other issues, they will likely argue that King Salman’s designation was solely designed for Prince Mohammed to evade justice.That is because, in announcing the change – an exception to Saudi law that calls for the king to also serve as prime minister – it is stated that King Salman will still act as prime minister in meetings in which he is present.Human-rights lawyers have also argued against giving sovereign immunity protection precedence over other principles human rights principles.Sign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterArchie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morningPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Any such decision would likely be seen as a sign to the court that the administration did not believe it had an interest in the case.“MBS’s [Mohammed bin Salman’s] ploy to secure immunity by designating himself as PM should be rejected as an abuse of sovereign immunity. To allow tyrants to dodge prosecution for war crimes and grave abuses by title-washing will eviscerate universal jurisdiction laws all over the world,” she said.Experts have also cautioned that much more is at stake for Prince Mohammed than the civil case in Washington. If a US judge were to determine that the crown prince should be granted sovereign immunity, it would likely assure the crown prince that he was no longer facing legal threats or the threat of possible arrest when he travels outside the kingdom. If a judge determines that Prince Mohammed ought not to be granted sovereign immunity – either because he is not yet fully ruler of the kingdom, or because his alleged wrongdoing was too grave – it would conversely send a stark message that the crown prince could face more legal trouble.The decision in the first instance will be made by Judge John Bates, who was appointed to the bench in 2001 by then-president, George W Bush. Bates has previously received media attention as a Republican-appointed federal judge who ruled against the Trump administration in 2018 after the White House sought to end an Obama-era programme known as Daca, which was designed to protect immigrants who arrived in the US as children. Bates called the Trump administration’s reasoning in the case “arbitrary” and said it had not given sufficient explanation of why the programme should be considered unlawful.",[{'name': 'Stephanie Kirchgaessner in Washington'}],Biden administration seeks delay over Prince Mohammed immunity decision
107,"Iran is awaiting the release of about $7bn (£6.3bn) in funds frozen abroad, state media said on Sunday, after it allowed an Iranian-American to leave the country and released his son from detention.Baquer Namazi, 85, was permitted to leave Iran for medical treatment abroad, and his son Siamak, 50, was released from detention in Tehran, the UN said on Saturday.“With the finalisation of negotiations between Iran and the United States to release the prisoners of both countries, $7bn of Iran’s blocked resources will be released,” said the state news agency, IRNA.Billions of dollars in Iranian funds have been frozen in a number of countries – notably China, South Korea and Japan – since the US reimposed biting sanctions on the Islamic republic in 2018 after unilaterally withdrawing from Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers.Tehran has accused Seoul of holding $7bn of its funds “hostage”, repeatedly calling on South Korean authorities to release it.IRNA on Sunday said that “Washington is pursuing at the same time the release of its citizens detained in Tehran and the release of Iranian funds in South Korea”.The development comes amid on-off talks that have been under way since April 2021 to revive the 2015 deal that gave Iran much-needed relief from sanctions in return for curbs on its nuclear programme.Iran has repeatedly called for the lifting of sanctions, as well as guarantees that the US will not again pull out of a revived deal.Baquer Namazi is a former Unicef official who was detained in February 2016 when he went to Iran to press for the release of his son, Siamak, who had been arrested in October the previous year.Both were convicted of espionage in October 2016 and sentenced to 10 years in prison.The father was released on medical leave in 2018 and had been serving his sentence under house arrest.",[{'name': 'Agence France-Presse'}],Iran says it is due $7bn for release of US-Iranian father and son

Subsequent operations are expected in coming months.Many of the women held in the camps say they were coerced or tricked into travelling to Syria by husbands who have since died. Most of the Australian children are under six; several were born in the camps. In 2019, Australia launched a secret rescue mission to repatriate eight Australian orphans, including a pregnant teenager, from the camps. But since then the government has refused to bring any more home, citing security concerns.

111,"​​A group of 12 people sit in camp chairs – chatting, smoking, listening – in the dark. Behind them, the Capitol building in Washington DC is luminescent, bringing into focus the Afghan flag. Well, the version of the flag before the Taliban changed it. It flies above their heads, catching the yellowy light of dusk.Since Kabul fell to the Taliban in August last year, military veterans and organizations have been lobbying Congress to offer Afghan evacuees long-term visas to stay in the US. Now, with no action taken and thousands coming to the end of their temporary stays, a different route is being taken to pass the Afghan Adjustment Act. This bipartisan bill would grant thousands of Afghans permanent status in the US.Afghanistan blast: 19 killed and dozens wounded at Kabul education centre, say policeRead moreIf cleared by additional security checks, Afghans who supported the US mission in Afghanistan or were evacuated after the fall of Kabul to the Taliban last August will be given long-term authorization to stay.“By sitting out here, we are trying to hold Congress accountable,” said Matt Zeller, a US army veteran and co-founder of No One Left Behind, an organization that advocates for special immigrant visa programs for foreign employees of the US.“In Afghanistan, these people had our backs,” he added. “Here, it is time that we had theirs.”Zeller is one of several veterans who have teamed up with Afghans in the US to spearhead this initiative, or “Fire Watch”, as the group refers to it. He is joined by his former interpreter, Safi, who saved his life while he was serving in Afghanistan.Safi moved to the US in 2010, and the two describe themselves as brothers and best friends. They spend Thanksgiving and Ramadan together, like family, and have even become uncles to each other’s children.Protesters are calling on Congress to pass the Afghan Adjustment Act. Photograph: Oliva Rose EmpsonHabiba Ashna Marhoon, a dual citizen of Afghanistan and the US, is here for similar reasons, with the same goals in mind.While she and Safi have permanent status to remain in the US, they have friends, families and colleagues who have been left in a legal gray zone – some uprooted from their homes only to be further neglected on US soil.“This is not for me; this is for the people who worked with the Americans,” said Marhoon. “For my brother-in-law, whose family is waiting in danger in Kandahar. And for the Afghan women activists who are in the US but whose visas soon expire.“They need this green card. The Taliban will kill them if they are made to go back.”Each day, Marhoon prepares traditional Afghan dishes to bring from her home in Virginia to the group outside the Capitol. A few days ago, it was bolani, a thin-crust flatbread often served with pumpkins or chives.“Safi told me that if I brought more, we might get more people,” Marhoon said, laughing. “I didn’t realize he was joking, so that’s what I’ve been doing.”Not all of those to whom this act is crucial can be there. Safi’s cousin Jamal, who worked with the US government in Afghanistan and also helped citizens escape during the US evacuation, is trapped in Kabul. He has been waiting to leave since last August with his wife and three young children. But because there is no guarantee of long-term stability in the US, he fears that if he left Afghanistan only to have to return, it would be “nothing but a suicide”.“This [Afghan Adjustment Act] would give my family and me much more patience,” Jamal said. “It would allow us to feel secure and more mentally relaxed about our future.”Roughly 80,000 Afghans in the US alone could be saved from an uncertain future under humanitarian parole status, which only grants individual citizenship for up to two years if the bill were to pass. And it would also extend a path to safety for many nationals left behind, which is imperative at a time when thousands are in danger. Yet the Afghan Adjustment Act faces opposition from several Republican politicians, who see the evacuees as a potential threat to US security.The vigil grows slowly in number as people have become frustrated over Congress’s inaction. Photograph: Oliva Rose Empson“If only they read the bill, they’d notice that enhanced vetting is an important component of it,” Safi said. “It also calls for the vetting of those who were evacuated last year.”Supporters of the Afghan Adjustment Act hoped it would be included in a recently passed short-term government funding bill. It was not, but they are still optimistic.“Realistically, this is probably just going to get attached to something else, so the next big target is the omnibus in December,” said lawyer and chair of the Afghan-American Foundation, Joseph Azam.“Congress will continue to kick the can further down the road,” Azam added.Until the bill passes, those involved say they will continue to wait it out, even if it takes another six months. They hope their presence outside the Capitol will pressure politicians as each day passes and there are more chairs, energy and faces joining the group. The initiative started with just three people. Yesterday, the total number reached about 30.Jamal can only watch the progress in Washington from social media live streams or WhatsApp calls from his apartment in Kabul.He misses the busy rush of his city, where he says the markets were once full and people loved their homes and lives.“There was a future besides bomb blasts,” he recounted. “But now, it is dark.”Every morning, he checks Twitter and waits for updates from his cousin, Safi.“Do I wish I could be there? Yes. But unfortunately, I can’t,” he said. “I need Safi to sit in front of Congress for me and for us until this act is passed.”",[{'name': 'Olivia Empson'}],‘These people had our backs’: US veterans lobby to rescue allies trapped in Afghanistan
112,"Eamonn McCabe, one of the most celebrated and admired newspaper photographers and picture editors of his generation, has died aged 74.McCabe was a multi-award-winning sports photographer at the Observer from 1976 and later became a trailblazing picture editor of the Guardian at a key moment in its history. His third act was as a portrait photographer, with 29 examples of his work in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery.McCabe’s death at his home in Suffolk on Sunday was sudden and unexpected. His wife, Rebecca Smithers, a former Guardian journalist, said McCabe was a kind, modest and encouraging character.“He was very generous to younger photographers coming up through the system,” she said. “He was very encouraging. He would give big lectures but also talk to tiny little camera clubs in village halls. If people wanted to hear about his work he was happy to do that.”The war photographer Don McCullin described McCabe as a lovely and straightforward man. “He was very passionate about photography and whenever you dealt with him he was always honest and a very nice human being. Like most of us, his life was photography.”The boxer Sylvester Mittee tapes his hands before a training session at Frank Warren’s gym in King’s Cross, London, in 1984. Photograph: Eamonn McCabe/The GuardianMcCullin said McCabe cut his teeth in what were the best of times, photographically, before the digital revolution.“Photography has lost its way a bit, the way colour and digital and all those things have come into fashion. A lot of people like me and him probably thought our number was up.”McCabe photographed McCullin for portraits on two occasions. “He was just such a nice guy, he was always so enthusiastic.”Katharine Viner, editor in chief of the Guardian, said: “Eamonn was a wonderful photographer and highly skilled picture editor, who helped make the Guardian and Observer into visual powerhouses.Diego Maradona is fouled during a friendly international between West Germany and Argentina in Buenos Aires, Argentina, 1982. Photograph: Eamonn McCabe/The Guardian“He was also a lovely man – as a young Guardian writer I was always thrilled if he was assigned to the same story as me. He will be greatly missed.”The former Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger said McCabe was unusual in that he essentially had three careers – sport photographer, picture editor and then portrait photographer.“It is very rare for somebody who does action sports to master the art of portrait photography. I think he is unique in that respect, he spanned three fields and excelled at all of them.”Ladies’ Day at Royal Ascot, 1976. Photograph: Eamonn McCabe/The GuardianMcCabe was born in north London and, aside from a spell at a film school in San Francisco, was self-taught as a photographer.He joined the Observer in 1976 and soon became a star, winning sports photographer of the year four times.He photographed the titanic Borg v McEnroe tennis matches, took a memorable picture of Brendan Foster running in the rain on his way to breaking the world 10,000 metres record, and was there for the 1978 Boat Race in which the Cambridge boat sank.“My first Boat Race, they sink, I get the blame for it … but it made a lovely picture,” he said in one interview.One of his most memorable pictures was of the Chinese table tennis player Li Zhenshi and his staggeringly high serve.In 1985 he was named news photographer of the year for his images from the Heysel stadium disaster.Juventus fans at Heysel stadium in 1985. McCabe was named news photographer of the year for his images of the disaster. Photograph: Eamonn McCabe/The GuardianAfter a spell as picture editor of Robert Maxwell’s short-lived SportsWeek, McCabe was hired as the Guardian’s picture editor by the paper’s editor, Peter Preston. It was a time when the new Independent newspaper was much more daringly showing the power of news photography and the Guardian, which had some great photographers, was falling behind, still using pictures in a traditional, often cliched way.McCabe became a big, brilliant part of the Guardian’s “modern, newsy, busy” redesign, winning picture editor of the year a record six times.His third act was as a portrait photographer including memorable series of writers in the rooms where they wrote and artists in their studios.Zadie Smith pictured circa 2015. Photograph: Eamonn McCabe/The GuardianSome of those are in the National Portrait Gallery collection, wonderful images of artists including Bridget Riley, Chris Ofili, Paula Rego and Frank Auerbach.Fiona Shields, the Guardian’s head of photography, described McCabe as “the godfather of photojournalism.“He really set a standard and left a legacy that we all follow and are really proud to follow. He was also an incredibly kind person with amazing good humour. He was always full of anecdotes and warmth.”Roger Tooth, who succeeded McCabe as Guardian picture editor, joked that both of them agreed that taking pictures and running the picture desk was “so much better than working”.He added: “Eamonn was a brilliant photographer and picture editor with a natural talent for capturing or identifying the unusual or unseen. With his natural warmth he was always an encouraging presence wherever he was.”McCabe was also a frequent speaker about photography, wrote several books and was involved in a number of television series including Britain in Focus for BBC Four.He is survived by Smithers and their daughter, Mabel, and his son, Ben, by a previous marriage.McCullin said McCabe was like all great photographers – he never stopped working. His wife said it was true. “Only two weeks ago he was photographing Aldeburgh rugby club, no job was too big or small.”",[{'name': 'Mark Brown'}],Guardian and Observer photographer Eamonn McCabe dies aged 74
113,"People who have recently been diagnosed with dementia, or who are diagnosed with the condition at a younger age, are among those at increased risk of suicide, researchers have found. The findings have prompted calls for greater support for those experiencing such cognitive decline.While previous research has explored a potential link between dementia diagnosis and suicide risk, the results have been inconclusive, with some suggesting a raised risk and others a reduced risk. Now researchers say certain groups of people with dementia are at increased risk of suicide.“What it tells us is that period immediately after diagnosis is when people really need support from the services that provide the diagnosis,” said Dr Charles Marshall, co-author of the research and a clinical senior lecturer and honorary consultant neurologist at the Wolfson Institute of Population Health at Queen Mary University of London. Writing in the journal JAMA Neurology, Marshall and colleagues report how they analysed data from people over the age of 15 in England covering the period from 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2019.The team identified 14,515 people who died by suicide and had health records available. They then matched each with up to 40 living people from the same primary care practice but who may have had a different sex, set of health conditions, or background.The team found that of the entire cohort of 594,674 individuals, 4,940 had a diagnosis of dementia of which 95 individuals – or about 2% – died by suicide. This rate was similar for those without dementia.However, after taking into account factors such as age and sex, those who were diagnosed with dementia before the age of 65 were at 2.82 times increased risk of suicide compared with those without the condition. An increased risk of suicide was also seen people in the first three months after diagnosis, and among those who had a psychiatric condition.In the first three months after being told they had dementia, those diagnosed before the age of 65 had an almost seven times greater risk of suicide compared with those without dementia – although this reduced somewhat over time.Marshall said it was unclear whether the findings were down to dementia itself causing people to feel suicidal, or factors such as people being concerned they may become a burden to their family.But, he added: “What I tell people when they’re diagnosed is that it’s possible to find ways of maintaining quality of life that is acceptable to you after a diagnosis of dementia.”Gavin Terry, head of policy at the Alzheimer’s Society, described the findings as shocking, and called for everyone diagnosed with dementia to have access to a dementia adviser or similar who could connect them with local support services.“No one should have to face dementia alone. Sadly, three in five people told us they haven’t received enough support from local services after their diagnosis, and just 0.2% of 1m referrals to talking therapy services mentioned a dementia diagnosis in 2018 – so we know people aren’t getting sufficient or timely mental health support,” he said.

114,"The Ministry of Defence has been forced to apologise after army families were left enduring the “unacceptable” standards of housing contractors given management deals worth £650m six months ago.The contracts had been lauded by the defence minister Leo Docherty in April but a letter was sent to families last week admitting to multiple failures amid claims of squalid and even dangerous accommodation.Complaints posted on public forums such as Facebook included holes in the exterior walls of the bedrooms of children, front doors without locks and unattended water leaks and cases of mould.The contracts covering 49,000 homes were supposed to bring an end to decades of sub-standard living conditions said to be driving people out of the service.David Bowden, the director of accommodation of the MoD’s defence infrastructure organisation (DIO), wrote to families on Wednesday admitting they were being failed despite government promises.“I want to apologise to you for the unacceptable levels of service you have received under the new accommodation contracts and for the disruption and inconvenience these failures have caused you,” Bowden wrote. “These contracts were designed firmly with families in mind and will deliver significant benefits for families. However, it is clear that the service you have received so far is well below what you have a right to expect.”Bowden suggested in his letter that soldiers and their families were arriving in homes that were not ready for them and that response times for maintenance appointments were being missed. Complaints were not being dealt with quickly and repair jobs were being drawn out.The development highlights the discrepancy between praise for the armed services during the Queen’s funeral and the low standards of care army families are often forced to endure.The state of the accommodation for the armed services has long been an issue of concern, exacerbated by a decision by the Conservative defence secretary Michael Portillo 26 years ago htat has left the government paying for the upkeep of MoD properties but unable to exploit the increase in their value.In 1996, the MoD sold 57,400 properties used by soldiers to Annington Homes, a company now owned by the billionaire Guy Hands, for £1.7bn and then leased them back at a discount over a 200-year lease.In 2018, the National Audit Office said the deal had cost the taxpayer up to £4.6bn due to the huge increase in the value of the property sold. The UK government is looking to take back ownership.The main £144m national management contract for housing allocations, repairs and maintenance was awarded to Pinnacle Group last year. It is responsible for providing a single point of contact for families.The company’s chief executive is Peregrine Lloyd, a former City fund manager who moved into the outsourcing sector in the 1990s. The company’s accounts record Pinnacle’s highest paid director, who is not named, as earning £320,000 in 2021, up from £291,000 the previous year.The year ending March 2022 was said in the company’s accounts to be a “landmark”, with budget targets exceeded and agreement on the government contract reached in what was described as a “significant step forward” for the firm.Regional maintenance contracts worth £506m were also handed to Amey community and Vivo Defence under Pinnacle. The defence arm of Amey was previously run by Amanda Fisher, who boasted on becoming chief executive of the parent company in 2021 of making it profitable. The highest paid director at Amey earned £732,000 in 2000 before Fisher took the top job.Vivo Defence, a 50:50 partnership between contractor Serco and the facilities management company Equans, is yet to file accounts.Collette Musgrave, the chief executive of the Army Families Federation, which represents the interests of those in the armed forces, said: “We recognise that the poor level of service is incredibly disappointing and frustrating for army families. We have been raising their concerns at the highest levels to push for rapid and significant improvements.“DIO may now have officially recognised the issues we have been flagging to them, but what families want to see is real and immediate improvements that deliver the service they were promised, and give them confidence that their homes are safe and secure. We hope that this acknowledgement is a first step in that direction.’’Pinnacle, Amey and Vivo Defence have been contacted for comment.",[{'name': 'Daniel Boffey Chief reporter'}],MoD apologises over ‘unacceptable’ standard of army homes
115,"A US pollster who advised Boris Johnson has delivered an impassioned plea for Tories to stop weaponising culture war issues, warning them they would “win an election but lose the country”.“It guarantees divisions for generations and it can get you elected but you will hate the result,” Frank Luntz told a fringe meeting at the Conservative party conference, which was packed out with Tory activists and elected officials eager to hear his advice on language and campaigning.Luntz, who has advised US Republican politicians including George W Bush, lacerated the Conservative party for using economic jargon such as “supply-side” – a favourite of Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng.In an exercise that generated laughter among hundreds present for the training session, he told them: “Write down supply-side. Now circle that word. Now put an X through it and don’t ever fucking use it again.”But it was when Luntz was asked how the Tories should respond to what was described as the “woke challenge” that he became most animated, telling those present: “I say this as somebody whose country is going through hell right now – it’s not worth winning an election if you lose a country and I am losing a country right now because we are so divided and so polarised.“It guarantees that you lose the ability to listen to each other and learn from each other.”In this context, a slide he presented listed “words to use”, which included “British values”, “freedom of speech” and “respect”. Under “words to lose”, he listed “Britain’s legacy”, “Britain’s foundations”, “British principles/beliefs” as well as “self determination”.In another slide, “the language of the UK”, terms to use were listed as “the truth”, “peace of mind” and “rethink”. Phrases to lose included “evidence-based”, “reimagine”, and “cooperate and compromise”.He said the party had made a serious error by suggesting they cared more about bankers than struggling working-class people, telling those present: “I don’t get. The reason why you won in 2019 is that you’re able to appeal to people who had never voted Conservative in their life, who had never been part of a Conservative majority. And you’re giving them up.”Asked during the session about how the Conservatives could protect their so-called red wall gains, Luntz said he was “frightened” by what was happening in the north of England and insisted the Tories needed to change their language to emphasise terms like “sacrifice” and “respect”.Sign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterArchie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morningPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

116,"Liz Truss packed her cabinet with “cronies off the backbenches” rather than competent ministers with a range of views, and appeared to have no coherent plan behind her mini-budget, Michael Heseltine has said.The ex-deputy prime minister and former senior Conservative, who sits in the Lords as an unaffiliated peer after being suspended from the party in 2019, also predicted that Truss’s chances of winning the next election were “looking pretty bleak”.Speaking at a fringe event on Monday at the Conservative conference in Birmingham, Heseltine said the prime minister’s plan for rapid economic growth would never work, castigating what he said was a curse of short-termism.“Only the prime minister can stop it,” Heseltine said, speaking alongside the former justice secretary David Gauke, who lost the Conservative whip under Boris Johnson.“And also by appointing ministers who know what the heck they’re doing, and have an agenda. There is just too much chopping and changing, and allegations that their friends are all in the cabinet.”Heseltine added: “This party which I served my life in is a very sophisticated political machine. It is a coalition of many different strands.“It is very important that what the prime minister should do is take the talent off the backbenches, not the cronies off the backbenches.”Heseltine said the mini-budget that sparked political and market turmoil 11 days ago appeared to have been based on a hoped-for outcome – faster growth – rather than a route to get there.“But what was the plan? They either had a plan – in which case, why don’t they publish it? Or the OBR [Office for Budget Responsibility] had a plan, which we’re told they did, so why didn’t they publish that? Or perhaps there was no plan. And that is serious.”Contrasting Truss’s approach with that of Margaret Thatcher, in whose cabinet he served, Heseltine warned that there were “no short-term miracles to growth”.“The great difference Liz Truss faces, and I can’t see how to deal with this, is she’s got two years, and to change anything significantly, to get results, is not possible in a two-year timescale,” he said. “I think you’ve got to tell the British people the truth about the situation.”Asked about Truss’s election prospects, Heseltine said they were “looking pretty bleak”. He went on: “It will require a pretty impressive feat of political leadership. And has to start today. Like this afternoon.”Gauke, who also said he felt Truss’s cabinet “has been defined on loyalty”, argued that the method by which Conservative party members could select a new leader did not work when it was in power.“Is the membership choosing the leader of the party, when that party is in government, a good system? Absolutely not,” he said.“There’s the long period of time where you’ve got uncertainty, I think it’s dangerous. And I also think that MPs are better qualified to make a judgement from party members.

117,"A former US army combat medic and counterintelligence agent allegedly solicited asylum seekers to join flights out of Texas to Martha’s Vineyard that Florida’s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, chartered.Perla Huerta was sent to Texas from Tampa to fill the planes at the center of the trips, which many have argued could amount to illegal human trafficking, a person briefed on an investigation into the case told the New York Times.In September, dozens of asylum seekers were transported to Martha’s Vineyard, an affluent community in Massachusetts, and were promised cash assistance, help with housing and other resources if they traveled to the state. DeSantis claimed responsibility for the flights, portraying it as a protest against the Joe Biden White House’s immigration policy.The flights – one of which made a stop in Florida – departed from San Antonio and therefore have drawn scrutiny from the sheriff’s office there.Huerta was discharged from the US army in August after serving the military branch for two decades. A migrant told CNN that a woman named “Perla” offered him clothes, food, and money in exchange to help find other migrants, mostly from Venezuela, to board the flights to Massachusetts. She gave him $10 McDonald’s gift cards to be handed out to the asylum seekers who agreed to join the flights.Florida officials confirmed a payment to the airline charter company, Vertol Systems, for $615,000 on 8 September. The money comes from a state budget signed earlier this year giving DeSantis $12m for a program to deport migrants.Vertol Systems offers aviation maintenance and training services and performs work for the US government. The company has networked with Florida’s Republican power brokers over the years.The charter has contributed money to some of DeSantis’s top allies, including the Congress member Matt Gaetz and Florida’s public safety director in charge of immigration policy, Larry Keefe, according to NBC News.Attorneys representing the asylum seekers have filed a federal class-action lawsuit against DeSantis and others, contending that the plaintiffs were misled into thinking they would receive benefits upon arrival to Martha’s Vineyard.However, those benefits are only available for refugees, a specific status that the asylum seekers do not currently fall under.Some legal experts have deemed DeSantis’s acts as human trafficking or smuggling. The group Lawyers for Civil Rights labeled the move as an “appalling” political stunt.In the San Antonio area, the Bexar county sheriff, Javier Salazar, launched an investigation examining the flights that took off from there.Upon the asylum seekers’ arrival, aid group workers quickly gathered food as well as supplies and set up shelter. Island residents set up a church to house the migrants and provided translation services.The asylum seekers were also receiving clothing from community thrift shops, and people were increasingly calling to volunteer to help them and donate to them.Many of the asylum seekers ended up at a military base in Cape Cod with little knowledge of what would happen next.The flights are an escalation of Republican officials sending hundreds of asylum seekers to predominantly Democratic areas. The Texas governor, Greg Abbott, has sent more than 100 migrants from Colombia, Cuba, Guyana, Nicaragua, Panama and Venezuela by bus from Texas to the Washington DC home of Vice-President Kamala Harris.Abbot has also sent buses to New York City.",[{'name': 'Coral Murphy Marcos'}],Ex-US army medic allegedly lured migrants on to flights to Martha’s Vineyard
118,"Speaking in front of a line of the latest electric vehicles (EVs) at this month’s North American International Auto Show, President Joe Biden declared: “The great American road trip is going to be fully electrified.”Most vehicles on the road are still gas guzzlers, but Washington is betting big on change, hoping that major federal investment will help reach a target set by the White House for 50% of new cars to be electric by 2030. But there are roadblocks – specifically when it comes to charging them all. “Range anxiety,” or how far one can travel before needing to charge, is still cited as a major deterrent for potential EV buyers.An electric vehicle charging station is displayed during the unveiling of a series of zero-emission heavy-duty trucks on 13 September. Photograph: Caroline Brehman/EPAThe auto industry recently passed the 5% mark of EV market share – a watershed moment, analysts say, before rapid growth. New policies at the state and local level could very well spur that growth: the Inflation Reduction Act, which passed this summer, offers tax credits of $4,000 to purchase a used EV and up to $7,500 for certain new ones. In August, California, the nation’s largest state and economy, announced rules that would ban all new gas-powered cars by 2035. New York plans to follow.So now, the race is on to provide chargers to power all those new EVs.The administration’s target of 500,000 public charging units by 2030 is a far cry from the current count of nearly 50,000, according to the Department of Energy’s estimate. And those new chargers will have to be fast – what’s known as Level 2 or 3 charging – and functional in order to create a truly reliable system. Today, many are not.Last week, the White House approved plans for all 50 states, along with Washington DC, and Puerto Rico, to set up chargers along highways, unlocking $1.5bn in federal funding to that end. The money comes from the landmark infrastructure bill passed last year, which invests $7.5bn for EV charging in total.Electric vehicle charging stations get green light across USRead moreBut how much of that money is spent is largely going to be determined at the local level. “It’s a difference between policy and practice,” said Drew Lipsher, the chief development officer at Volta, an EV charging provider. “Now that the federal government has these policies, the question becomes, OK, how does this actually get implemented?” The practice, he said, is up to states and municipalities.As EV demand spikes, a growing number of cities are adopting policies for EV charging construction. In July, the city of Columbus passed an “EV readiness” ordinance, which will require new parking structures to host charging stations proportionate to the number of total parking spots, with at least one that is ADA-accessible. Honolulu and Atlanta have passed similar measures.One major challenge is creating a distribution model that can meet a diversity of needs.At the moment, most EV owners charge their cars at home with a built-in unit, which governments can help subsidize. But for apartment dwellers or those living in multi-family homes, that’s less feasible. “When we’re thinking about the largest pieces of the population, that’s where we need to really be focusing our attention. This is a major equity issue,” said Alexia Melendez Martineau, the policy manager at Plug-In America, an EV consumer advocacy group.Bringing power to people is one such solution. In Hoboken, New Jersey, Volta is working with the city to create a streetside charging network. “The network will be within a five-minute walk of every resident,” said Lipsher. “Hopefully this is a way for us to really import it to cities who believe public EV charging infrastructure on the street is important.” Similarly, in parts of Los Angeles – as in Berlin and London – drivers can get a charge from a street lamp.And there may be new technologies that could help, exciting experts and EV enthusiasts alike. That could include the roads themselves charging EVs through a magnetizable concrete technology being piloted in Indiana and Detroit. And bidirectional charging, where, similar to solar panels, drivers can put their electricity back into the grid – or perhaps even to another EV, through what’s known as electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE). Nissan approved the technology for their Leaf model this month.Magnetizable concrete could charge the batteries of electric vehicles while they’re driving. Photograph: Magment/Holcim LtdProchazka said he imagined a future where cities rely on excess EV charge when energy demand spikes, rather than polluting peaker plants that are currently turned on to boost supply. “We haven’t even scratched the surface on the opportunities that are gonna exist once we get bidirectional happening,” said Prochazka.Experts hope these advances will help bridge the gap in historically disconnected areas, such as rural communities and communities of color. But first, planners have to listen: although extensive community engagement trials have been praised in states such as Arizona, the local National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) chapter in Indiana accused the state’s draft plan of excluding Black communities.“The more the community has input on where these chargers go, how they’re used and how they’re designed,” said Melendez Martineau, “the better they’re going to serve the community.”Still, the US seems significantly more poised to electrify now than it did six months ago, says Dale Hall, a senior researcher who focuses on EVs at the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT).He says that the private sector, which is behind much of the charging infrastructure, is moving ahead with clear signals of support from the public sector. Stronger local policies or cutting-edge technology will only help dictate the speed of that transition, Hall added.He thinks the Biden administration’s goal for chargers is achievable. “The business case is just going to keep getting better.”",[{'name': 'John Surico'}],The American EV boom is about to begin.

119,"Next week, the US supreme court will hear oral arguments in a case that could put climate, public health and animal welfare regulations across the country on the chopping block – from California’s ban on gas-powered cars by 2035 to state bans on food packaging that contains BPA or lead.The case will consider the constitutionality of California’s Proposition 12, a law that bans the sale of meat and eggs from animals raised using certain kinds of extreme confinement. The pork industry has been fighting Prop 12 since it passed by ballot measure in 2018 – with more than 62% of the vote and the backing of animal advocacy groups like the Humane Society of the United States – because it bans gestation crates: metal enclosures where pregnant pigs are kept for most of their lives that are so small that they can’t turn around or stretch their limbs.The crates are standard practice in the pork industry even though, according to a supreme court brief filed by 378 veterinarians and animal welfare scientists, they “cause profound, avoidable suffering and deprive pigs of a minimally acceptable level of welfare”. According to a brief by the American Public Health Association, the Infectious Diseases Society of America and other groups, they can also contribute to disease spread to humans.All of the pork industry’s legal challenges to Prop 12 so far have been unsuccessful, but in March, the supreme court agreed to hear its case. The US Department of Justice has since filed a brief backing the pork industry, a move that surprised many observers, especially since a group of 15 Democratic and independent senators previously urged the solicitor general to support Prop 12. (The Trump administration also briefed in favor of the pork industry when the case was being considered by a lower court.)In this 2014 file image, pregnant sows are housed in crates at a pig farm in Dalhart, Texas. Photograph: Richard Tsong-Taatarii/Minneapolis Star Tribune/Zuma Press Inc/Alamy Stock PhotoA decision is expected between December and next June.At issue is whether Prop 12 violates the constitution’s “dormant commerce clause” by imposing an unreasonable burden on interstate trade. While several states ban gestation crates within their borders, California’s law takes the added step of banning the sale of pork produced with gestation crates anywhere in the world. The National Pork Producers Council and the American Farm Bureau Federation, the two lobby groups that brought the case, argue that because California imports almost all the pork it consumes from other states, Prop 12 would force the industry to overhaul its practices to cater to Californians.Neither organization provided comment for this story.That the supreme court took up the case at all surprised some court watchers, because the pork industry’s argument breaks with past precedent. “The constitution does not guarantee the right to pork producers to have an uninhibited national market,” said Kelsey Eberly, a legislative policy fellow at Harvard law school. “The whole idea behind the commerce clause is to prevent discrimination on interstate commerce,” she said; if, for example, California were holding out-of-state pork to a different standard than pork raised in-state, which is not the case with Prop 12.This could signal the court’s interest in putting stricter limits on states’ ability to regulate commerce. “A lot of the time, the United States supreme court hears cases not so much to resolve the dispute between these particular parties, but to announce doctrine,” said Mark Rosen, a professor at the Chicago-Kent College of Law, who co-authored a brief defending the constitutionality of Prop 12.It’s common for state and local laws to regulate the sale of goods produced in other states, which means that if Prop 12 goes, these too could be at risk of invalidation. According to a recent Harvard Law School report by Eberly, these could include low-carbon fuel standards, state bans on carcinogenic ingredients in personal care products, and lead and BPA in food containers, among others. California’s planned ban on gas cars would also be at risk, as well as animal welfare laws, like California’s ban on fur sales and hundreds of cities’ bans on selling animals bred in puppy mills.Lobby groups for other industries have filed briefs urging the supreme court to overturn Prop 12, including the pharmaceutical industry and producers of foie gras – a meat product made by force-feeding ducks to engorge their livers, which has been banned in California and New York City.Part of the pork industry’s case relies on the argument that Prop 12 would force big changes throughout the entire industry, not just on farms producing pork for California, because, it argues, “it is impracticable, in the complex, multi-stage pork production process, to trace a single cut of pork back to a particular sow housed in a particular manner.”But many observers have cast doubt on this claim, including the UC Davis agricultural economists Richard Sexton and Daniel Sumner, who have studied the economic impacts of Prop 12 with funding from the National Pork Board. “Not only are [the industry’s] arguments flawed as a reflection of basic economic incentives, but they are factually implausible,” Sexton and Sumner wrote in a brief to the supreme court.Some pork sold nationwide is already labeled crate-free, a claim that requires tracing. “That’s modern agriculture,” Sexton said. “Products are being differentiated in a whole variety of ways: organic, GMO-free, different properties related to animal welfare, antibiotic-free.”Less than 10% of North American pork production will need to convert to crate-free to satisfy California’s demand, Sexton said. “So it’s a much smaller infringement in reality on commerce and pork production in the US than is being claimed.”While the pork lobby claims that Prop 12’s requirements are unreasonably onerous, large pork companies have told their investors a different story, indicating that they would be able to comply without difficulty. In a 2020 earnings call, the Tyson CEO, Donnie King, said Prop 12 represents only 4% of its production and that the company “can do multiple programs simultaneously, including Prop 12”. Hormel said in a statement that it “faces no risk of material losses from compliance with Proposition 12”. Smithfield, the country’s biggest pork producer, stated in its 2021 sustainability report that it would comply with Prop 12 and a similar law passed in Massachusetts. A representative from the California department of food and agriculture confirmed the “relatively straightforward” process of pig tracing after visiting pork producers across the country.Pork products displayed on a shelf at a Safeway store in San Francisco, California. Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesSexton and Sumner’s research found that California retail pork prices would increase about 7.2% as a result of Prop 12, but would slightly decrease elsewhere in North America. The law applies only to whole, uncooked pork cuts, like bacon and pork chops, not ground pork, combination products like hotdogs and pizzas, or pre-cooked products like deli meats. Pork products not covered by the law won’t see price increases.While the supreme court’s pro-business inclination has made many advocates worried about Prop 12, the outcome is unpredictable. Two of the court’s conservative justices, Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas, don’t believe the dormant commerce clause is appropriate doctrine, Rosen said, “and there may be others who haven’t yet declared themselves”.“I’m hoping that the court, once it gets to oral argument, is rethinking the wisdom of granting this petition,” Eberly said. “Because the arguments on the pork producers’ side are just exceptionally weak.”",[{'name': 'Marina Bolotnikova'}],US supreme court to hear case on California’s ban on extreme confinement crates
120,"Good morning.The death toll from Hurricane Ian has passed 80 as embattled residents in Florida and the Carolinas face a recovery expected to cost tens of billions of dollars, and some officials faced criticism over their response to the storm.The death toll was expected to keep rising as flood waters receded and search teams pushed further into areas initially cut off from the outside world. Hundreds of people have been rescued as emergency workers sifted through homes and buildings inundated with water or completely washed away.At least 85 storm-related deaths have been confirmed since Ian crashed ashore Florida’s Gulf with catastrophic force on Wednesday as a category 4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 150mph (240kph).Residents walk through a neighborhood in Orlando, Florida, that was flooded by Hurricane Ian.

US would ‘take out’ Russian troops and equipment if Putin uses nuclear weapons, says PatraeusVladimir Putin. Photograph: Contributor/8523328/Getty ImagesThe US and its allies would destroy Russia’s troops and equipment in Ukraine – as well as sink its Black Sea fleet – if the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, uses nuclear weapons in the country, former CIA director and retired four-star army general David Petraeus warned yesterday.Petraeus said that he had not spoken to the national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, on the likely US response to nuclear escalation from Russia, which administration officials have said has been repeatedly communicated to Moscow.He told ABC News: “Just to give you a hypothetical, we would respond by leading a Nato – a collective – effort that would take out every Russian conventional force that we can see and identify on the battlefield in Ukraine and also in Crimea and every ship in the Black Sea.”Meanwhile, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said that Ukraine is not only experiencing military success in Lyman, but also in Kherson. In his overnight statement, he said Ukraine forces have liberated the small Arkhanhelske and Myrolyubivka settlements in the Kherson region.

Brazil election: ex-president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva to face Jair Bolsonaro in runoffBrazilians will go to the polls again after former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva won the first vote but failed to secure a majority over the incumbent. Photograph: Rodrigo Paiva/Getty ImagesBrazil’s acrimonious presidential race will go to a second round after the former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva failed to secure the overall majority he needed to avoid a runoff with the far-right incumbent, Jair Bolsonaro.With more than 99.5% of votes counted, the leftist veteran had secured 48.3% of the vote, not enough to avoid the 30 October showdown with his rightwing rival. Bolsonaro, who significantly outperformed pollsters’ predictions and will be buoyed up by the result, received 43.3%.Addressing the media at a hotel in downtown São Paulo, Lula, who was president from 2003 until 2010, struck a defiant tone, declaring: “The struggle continues until our final victory.”“We are going to win these elections – this for us is simply extra time,” vowed Lula, who was barred from the 2018 election in which Bolsonaro was elected, on corruption charges that were later overturned.
What has Bolsonaro said? The far-right leader said: “I understand there were a lot of votes [cast] because of the condition of the Brazilian people, who feel priceincreases, especially basic products. I understand that a lot of people desire change but some changes can be for the worst.”

We were soon running around the garden with our arms flailing until we collapsed in a heap together on the ground laughing, our legs entwined.

121,"Stacey Abrams was a high school senior the first time she was invited to the Georgia governor’s mansion. It was for a ceremony honoring the state’s class valedictorians, and Abrams was her school’s top academic achiever. At the time, her family did not own a car, so Abrams and her parents rode the bus from their working-class suburb to the stately mansion in downtown Atlanta.When they arrived, Abrams recalls a guard emerging from the security booth. Eyeing the bus, he told them: “This is a private event. You don’t belong here.” Never mind that her invitation was tucked into her mother’s handbag or that her name was second on the list of invitees.Ginni Thomas still believes Trump’s false claim the 2020 election was stolenRead moreA terse exchange ensued between her father and the guard, who grudgingly checked the guest list and let them in.“The thing of it is,” Abrams said at a recent campaign stop in Atlanta, “I don’t remember meeting the governor of Georgia. I don’t remember meeting my fellow valedictorians from 180 school districts … All I remember is a man standing in front of the most powerful place in Georgia, looking at me, telling me I don’t belong.”But the story doesn’t have to end there, Abrams tells supporters as she campaigns to become the first Black female governor in American history. With their help this November, she promises, they will “open those gates wide” and “win the future for Georgia”.Four years ago, Abrams came within a hair of it. She lost the Georgia governorship to Republican Brian Kemp by fewer than 55,000 votes, in a race dominated by allegations of voter suppression, which Kemp, then the secretary of state overseeing the election, denied.In her near-miss, national Democrats saw a promising leader – and the potential to reclaim the southern state that had long ago slipped away. Successive Democratic wins in the years that followed validated her work expanding the electorate, a decade-long project aimed at mobilizing the disillusioned and the marginalized.Abrams was even considered a potential running mate for Joe Biden in 2020, a prospect she welcomed. But she always kept her sights on the governor’s mansion, declining pleas to run for the Senate. Now, her second chance has arrived.I can’t get this job if you all don’t show up. I can get this job if you all do what you did in 2018Stacey AbramsYet Abrams, hailed by Democrats as the architect of Georgia’s political transformation, enters the final weeks of her rematch with Kemp an underdog.Polls consistently show the 48-year-old Democrat trailing Kemp, now a relatively popular governor with the advantage of incumbency. The latest Atlanta Journal-Constitution (AJC) poll found that the governor had significantly expanded his lead over Abrams, 50% to 42%. And while Abrams has stronger support among her base than Kemp, according to a Monmouth University survey, it concluded that her path to victory was “much narrower”.But Abrams is refusing to be counted out. A Yale-educated tax attorney, she says she trusts her math better than the polls. In the fast-growing and diversifying battleground state, she notes that as many as 1.6 million new voters have been added to the rolls since 2018, many times Kemp’s margin of victory that year.“Every success I’ve ever had in politics has been about building the electorate I need – building the electorate we should have, which is an electorate that’s much more reflective of the state,” Abrams said during an interview at a coffee shop in Atlanta.Georgia is nearly evenly divided between the parties, and in many ways, Abrams and Kemp embody the dueling factions of the state’s polarized electorate. Abrams, a former state house minority leader and prominent voting rights advocate, is working to mobilize Black, Latino and Asian American voters along with young people in Atlanta and its sprawling suburbs. While Kemp, a staunch conservative who easily defeated a Trump-backed primary challenge earlier this year, draws overwhelming support from white voters in the rural and exurban parts of the state.“This is 100% the battle of the bases,” said Nsé Ufot, leader of the New Georgia Project, a group founded by Abrams to register and engage young people and voters of color. “And it’s 100% going to be determined by who shows up to vote and whose votes get counted.”Republican Brian Kemp at a rally in Alpharetta, Georgia last week, as an Abrams supporter holds up a sign. Photograph: Erik S Lesser/EPACanvassers with the New Georgia Project are pounding the pavement to register and turn out voters this cycle. Their goal is to knock on at least 2m doors by election day. Though some Democrats have expressed doubts about Abrams’ expansion strategy, Ufot said it has already proven effective by paving the way for Biden’s victory in 2020 and the election of two Democratic senators in 2021, which delivered the party control of the chamber.“Now is the time to double down, not to second guess ourselves,” she said.Despite a deeply loyal base, surveys suggest Abrams has become a more polarizing figure since her last campaign. Supporters say it is not surprising, after four years of being vilified by conservatives as a far-left extremist who views the governorship only as a stepping stone to the presidency.But it may be making it harder for Abrams to attract the vanishingly thin slice of independent and moderate Republican voters whose discomfort with Trump pushed them toward Democrats in recent elections. A Marist Poll found that 11% of Georgians who voted for Biden in 2020 plan to back Kemp for governor, while just 5% of Trump voters favor Abrams.“If Abrams looks to be more than a contender and she wants to win,” said Andra Gillespie, a political scientist at Emory University in Atlanta, “she really is going to have to shake the tree and find a few more Democratic voters.”Meanwhile, Trump loyalists who were once wary of Kemp have largely aligned behind him, persuaded by his conservative record and their fear of an Abrams victory.“We definitely cannot have a Stacey Abrams governorship in Georgia,” said Salleigh Grubbs, chair of the Cobb County Republican party, which censured Kemp in 2021. “That’s a very scary proposition.”Kemp’s refusal to overturn Biden’s victory in Georgia during the turbulent weeks after the 2020 election infuriated Trump. In the months that followed, he made Kemp the target of a vengeance campaign, even once musing that Abrams would make a better governor.But since Kemp’s strong primary showing, Trump has mostly stayed away from the governor’s race. And Republican allies say Kemp’s independence will probably help him win back disaffected suburban voters.Abrams is vocal in her view that Kemp deserves no credit for withstanding pressure to subvert a free and fair election.“While I’m glad that he didn’t commit treason, that is not a reason to lionize him,” she said in the interview. “He simply did not do one thing and he has used that to cloak every other bad behavior.”Kemp, Abrams argues, has been relatively silent on Trump’s efforts to overturn the election, even as the former president’s stolen-election myth continues to resonate deeply with conservatives in the state. He also backed an overhaul of the state’s voting laws that critics said was rooted in Trump’s groundless claims of widespread fraud.“Kemp is a Maga Republican who has done everything in his power to align himself with not only Trump’s values but Trump’s behavior,” she added. “He has just done it in a more subtle way.”In Georgia, like elsewhere, Democrats face a challenging political environment. Voters have soured on the president amid widespread economic malaise and anxiety about the rising cost of living.With the economy top of mind for voters, Kemp has sought to tie Abrams to Biden and warned that her economic plans would deepen inflation. At the same time, he is campaigning as a steward of Georgia’s bustling economy, which includes record-low unemployment and a record $21.2bn in state-tracked business investments.Abrams at a campaign rally at the Two Eggs restaurant in McDonough, Georgia, in July. Photograph: Erik S Lesser/EPAAccording to the AJC poll, Georgians were significantly more pessimistic about the direction of the country than the direction of their state. On the campaign trail, Kemp attributes the rosier outlook to his decision to reopen businesses after they closed during the earliest months of the pandemic. He also approved of popular policies that boosted teacher pay, provided tax rebates to families and suspended the state’s gas tax.“The courage that we have seen from Governor Brian Kemp has been extraordinary,” said Nikki Haley, the former Republican governor of South Carolina, during a campaign appearance with Kemp at a burger joint in Atlanta. “First state in the country to open up after Covid – he was vilified for it, and it turns out that he’s the one that saved the economy, saved our businesses … and allowed people to get back to work.”Abrams has sought to paint a starkly different picture of the economy under Kemp, one in which the wealthiest have profited while the poor have been left behind. At the center of her economic agenda is a plan to fully expand Medicaid, which she argues is critical to stopping a wave of hospital closures across the state, including a major trauma center in Atlanta that has become a flashpoint in the campaign.But it is a brewing national backlash to the supreme court decision overturning the federal right to an abortion that Abrams and Democrats believe could change the tide. In ads and on the campaign trail, Abrams has lashed Kemp for signing a 2019 law that bans abortion as early as six weeks in Georgia, before many women know they are pregnant. The law was allowed to take effect in the aftermath of the high court’s ruling.According to recent polling, most voters in Georgia disagree with the supreme court decision in Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization and more than half say the state’s abortion laws are too strict.“The No 1 issue that people talk about when I’m on the campaign trail is abortion rights,” said Nabilah Islam, the Democratic nominee for a competitive state senate seat in Gwinnett county.Islam, who has put abortion access at the center of her campaign, pointed to the rise in voter registration among women since the Dobbs decision. “There’s a feeling of helplessness,” she said, “but also hope because people are so angry that they’re organizing at levels unseen before.”Abrams is also working to shore up her base. Black voters are the cornerstone of the Democrats coalition in Georgia. While they still overwhelmingly prefer Democrats, there are some signs the party is struggling to motivate Black voters at the levels needed to win in Georgia.The trend is particularly pronounced among Black men, who have edged toward Republicans in recent years. In several polls, Kemp has notably improved his standing among Black voters from 2018.Ron DeSantis changes with the wind as Hurricane Ian prompts flip-flop on aidRead moreAbrams says she is taking no vote for granted. As part of her campaign’s outreach to Black men, she has hosted a series of conversations called “Stacey and the Fellas” to discuss how her initiatives on issues like healthcare and housing will benefit their communities.At one such event over the summer, she was blunt: “If Black men vote for me, I will win Georgia.”Andrekay Askew is among the roughly one in 10 Black voters who remain undecided in the state. The 27-year-old said he is skeptical of Democrats’ economic policies but was open to learning more about Abrams’s platform.Ultimately, he said, his decision would be guided by: “Who is better with the money?”Listening from the porch, his mother shook her head in disagreement. Laqua Askew, who works in special education, is a lifelong Democrat who voted for Abrams in 2018 and plans to do so again this year. She is worried about a lack of public school funding, as well as gun violence and crime, all of which she said takes a heavy toll on the low-income students she works with.“Kemp had the opportunity to make a change but he hasn’t,” she said. “We’ve got to try something else.”In a state as closely divided as Georgia, much could still change before election day. Kemp and Abrams will face off in a public debate that could help sway the critical few undecided voters. And if neither candidate wins a majority of the vote, the contest proceeds to a runoff election.Speaking at the AFL-CIO Labor Day picnic last month, Abrams asked supporters to spend the final weeks of the campaign focused on the “unfinished business” before them.“I can’t get this job if you all don’t show up,” she said. “I can get this job if you all do what you did in 2018.”

122,"Sacheen Littlefeather, Native American activist who famously declined Marlon Brando’s Oscar for The Godfather, has died aged 75, the Academy of Motion Pictures announced on Sunday.Littlefeather had been suffering from breast cancer.The Academy announced her death in a tweet on Sunday night. The Hollywood Reporter cited a statement from her caretaker that said she died at noon on Sunday at her home in the Northern California city of Novato, surrounded by her loved ones.Brando won the best actor Oscar in 1973 for his role in the Godfather but did not attend the ceremony, protesting in support of Native American rights. Littlefeather appeared at the event on Brando’s behalf. She declined to accept the award and gave a short speech explaining the actor’s refusal was due, in part, to “the treatment of American Indians today by the film industry … and on television, in movie reruns.”‘I promised Brando I would not touch his Oscar’: the secret life of Sacheen LittlefeatherRead moreLittlefeather, then 26, was booed; she later alleged that actor John Wayne had to be held back by security guards backstage from assaulting her.

The body that oversees the Oscars described her appearance as “a powerful statement that continues to remind us of the necessity of respect and the importance of human dignity”.“The abuse you endured because of this statement was unwarranted and unjustified. The emotional burden you have lived through and the cost to your own career in our industry are irreparable. For too long the courage you showed has been unacknowledged. For this, we offer both our deepest apologies and our sincere admiration,” it said.Littlefeather responded by saying: “Regarding the Academy’s apology to me, we Indians are very patient people – it’s only been 50 years! We need to keep our sense of humour about this at all times. It’s our method of survival.”In an interview with the Guardian in 2021, Littlefeather told of her tough childhood. She was born in 1946, the daughter of an Apache and Yaqui father and a white mother – both of whom were mentally ill and unable to raise her. She was taken away at the age of three and raised by her maternal grandparents; she remembered, as a small child, hitting her father with a broom to stop him from beating her mother. “I think that’s when I really became an activist.”Littlefeather began visiting reservations in Arizona when she was 17, after her father had died. “I really had a breakthrough, with other urban Indian people, getting back into our traditions, our heritage. The old people who came from different reservations taught us young people how to be Indian again. It was wonderful.”By her early 20s, Littlefeather was working at a San Francisco radio station, heading up a local affirmative action committee for Native Americans, and studying representation on screen and in sports. When she heard Marlon Brando speaking about Native American rights, she wrote him a letter; months later, he called, and they became good friends.In the same interview, Littlefeather – now an elder, teaching cultural knowledge to younger Native American people – said she was “very, very ill” with breast cancer.“I’ve been on chemotherapy for quite some time, and daily antibiotics. As a result, my memory is not as good as it used to be,” she said. “I’m very tired all the time because cancer is a full-time job: the CT scans, MRIs, laboratory blood work, medical visits, chemotherapy, infectious disease control doctors, etc, etc. If you’re lazy, you need not apply for cancer.”Speaking of death, she said: “I’m going to another place. I’m going to the world of my ancestors. I’m saying goodbye to you … I’ve earned the right to be my true self.”",[{'name': 'Guardian staff'}],"Sacheen Littlefeather, actor and activist who declined Marlon Brando’s Oscar, dies aged 75"
