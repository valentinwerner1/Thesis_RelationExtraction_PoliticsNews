1,"In a vain bid to celebrate his illegal annexation of Ukrainian territory, Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday congratulated educators on Teachers’ Day, and promised to organize new medical exams and restful autumn holidays for schoolchildren in “restless and even dangerous” areas of Ukraine. But even as he spoke, Russian forces continued to retreat from the territories Putin just claimed as his own.Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine.ArrowRight“I congratulate school workers in all 89 regions of Russia,” Putin said in his video message, emphasizing his new tally of Russian federal subjects — increased by four with the addition of the Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions in Ukraine that he is trying to seize.Putin’s surreal message to the war-torn areas amid cascading Russian military setbacks on the battlefield created a stark split-screen between the image of control that the Kremlin is trying to project and the reality on the front lines, where Russia has been losing ground for weeks. Earlier Wednesday, the president had signed the legislation to absorb the seized regions into Russia despite his lack of control.AdvertisementAs he spoke, the Russian leader gave no indication that his grip on the regions had already slipped. “Let me emphasize: Russia has been and will be sovereign,” he said, adding: “Above all, it is necessary to convey the moral cultural code of the Russian people to the children and exclude attempts to impose alien and perverted interpretations of history.”Highlighting the contradiction of Putin’s claim that Russia will remain in the four annexed eastern Ukrainian regions “forever” and the reality on the ground, however, the president’s spokesman conceded Wednesday that “certain areas” in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions were under Kyiv’s control and still needed to be retaken by Russia.“Control will be regained, nonetheless, over certain territories there, and we will continue to consult with that part of the population expressing the desire to live with Russia,” the spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said in a conference call with reporters.Putin faces limits of his military power as Ukraine recaptures landThe veneer Putin hoped to create of a successful annexation, absorbing four Ukrainian regions back into the “Fatherland,” was shattering amid ongoing criticism of his botched military mobilization aimed at calling up 300,000 new troops and glum, defeated reports of new battlefield losses by hawkish military correspondents with massive online audiences.Advertisement“Friends, I know that you expect me to comment on the situation, but I really don’t know what to tell you,” pro-Russian military reporter Roman Saponkov wrote on Telegram about Russian losses along the Dnieper River. “The retreat from the north of the right bank in the Kherson region is a disaster.”“Vysokopillya, Lyubimovka, Velyka Oleksandrivka, Davydov Grid, these places have been showered with the blood of our soldiers,” Saponkov added, listing key towns in Kherson that the Ukrainian army captured in just the past 48 hours.Just a month after Russian forces were routed from the northeast Kharkiv region in a lightning offensive, Ukrainian troops have made gains in Donetsk, and are pushing into Luhansk, the region where Russia had its strongest control.As Moscow acknowledged its defenses in the south had been breached, Russian audiences saw tense exchanges on television as top propagandists struggled to explain why the Russian military was experiencing setback after setback, and to manufacture some optimism.Advertisement“We have lost 17 settlements in the Kherson region,” Alexander Sladkov, a war reporter with Russia 1 state channel, said on air during one of the main talk shows, “60 Minutes.”“This is concerning, to say the least. Why there was no cover there?” the host, Olga Skabeeva, responded.“We are waiting for the reinforcement, it is coming, but if we throw them into battle now, pardon me, what will happen to them?” Sladkov said. “If we mobilized 300,000 people at the beginning of the war, when we had heavy casualties, we would’ve spent them, too. Now it’s different; we understand now that a soldier has to be prepared.”“When will there be positive changes for Russia?” Skabeeva asked.“If we are talking about big, significant offensives, I would say two months,” Sladkov replied.For fresh manpower, Putin is betting on the tens of thousands of mobilized men to shore up the depleted ranks of units fighting in Ukraine and grant leave to exhausted soldiers, some of whom haven’t been rotated out since the start of the invasion in February.Advertisement“In many sectors of the front line, fatigue has sunk in after a long offensive period, during which large territories were liberated,” Alexander Kots, a military correspondent for Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper, wrote Tuesday on his Telegram blog. “But there is no longer any strength left to hold them.”‘I refuse to comply,’ says Russian journalist, days after escaping house arrestWestern military experts say the Russian leader may be running out of time to turn around his ailing invasion and is facing a difficult choice: spend more time training the reinforcements but risk allowing Ukraine to advance its counteroffensive further, or throw the mobilized men into battle quickly in hopes that they will be able to hold ground despite some having little to no combat experience.But there was continuing evidence that the mobilization is not going well.Roman Starovoit, the governor of the Kursk region in western Russia, which is one of the key staging grounds for the invasion, described the state of some military units he recently toured as “awful.”Advertisement“I cannot understand how an active training unit of the Ministry of Defense can be in such a condition,” Starovoit said. “A ruined canteen, broken and rusty showers, lack of beds, and the existing ones are broken.”“There is a lack of uniforms, the parade ground looks as if it had been bombed,” the governor added. “It is good that at least there is equipment and weapons to refresh the skills and improve professionalism.”Officially, the Russian Defense Ministry has said the newly called-up soldiers will receive “up to one month of training.” But there have been multiple reports of military commissariats deploying soldiers to the front just days after they were summoned.The problems with the mobilization, which was announced just two weeks ago, snowballed so quickly that more than 20 Russian regional governors resorted to a rare public admission that mistakes had been made, and they carried out several public dismissals of enlistment officers.AdvertisementThere have been widespread reports of men unfit to serve being called to duty, including some who are blind, deaf, disabled or elderly.In a speech Wednesday, Putin accused the Defense Ministry of not cementing exemptions for students, professionals of key industries, and other people in the call-up regulations.“Initially, the Ministry of Defense reported that several categories of our citizens did not need to be called up as part of mobilization, but they still did not make the relevant changes to the regulations,” Putin said during a meeting with a group of teachers. “We now have to make appropriate corrections.”At least nine mobilized soldiers died even before they got to the battlefield, some of heart ailments, further raising questions about how enlistment officers are adhering to health criteria for recruits. Others died under murky circumstances. Local media reported that a young man died Sunday at a training site in Krasnoyarsk after a conflict between him and other men at the site.AdvertisementThree men from one garrison in the Sverdlovsk region died: one of a heart attack, and another by suicide; and a third, after he had been sent home, succumbed to liver failure linked to excessive alcohol consumption, an official told local news outlet EA News.Here are the nuclear weapons Russia has in its arsenalThese deaths reveal deeper issues in the mobilization efforts, linked to low morale and abysmal conditions in some training centers, where mobilized men sometimes have to sleep on the floor and where the Defense Ministry apparently lacks such basic provisions as socks, adequate food and uniforms.“Our guys need thermal underwear, warm socks, gloves, cigarettes, sugar, and canned meat,” a message read in one of the groups on Vkontakte, a social media site, organized by mothers and wives of Russian soldiers to crowdsource gear the men need.“My husband has just asked for these combat boots,” Anna, whose husband was recently called up, wrote in a Vkontakte chatroom.Natalia Abbakumova in Riga, Latvia, and Robyn Dixon contributed to this report.",Mary Ilyushina,Putin cites success in annexed regions even as his exhausted troops retreat
2,"LONDON — Prime Minister Liz Truss on Wednesday sought to shore up her authority after a brutal first month in office by asserting that while not everyone favors the changes her new government is pushing, “everyone will benefit from the result — a growing economy and a better future.”Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine.ArrowRightBut just moments into her keynote speech to the annual Conservative Party conference, she was interrupted by Greenpeace protesters carrying a banner that read: “Who voted for this?” They were quickly removed from the hall.British Prime Minister Liz Truss was heckled by two protesters holding a Greenpeace banner during her speech in Birmingham, England, on Oct. 5. (Video: Reuters)The Conservative Party conference, featuring a new prime minister, was a moment the party had hoped would mark a fresh start after the many scandals of her predecessor, Boris Johnson. Instead, Truss had to defend the first weeks of her premiership, already marked by historic economic volatility, a revolt within her party and voters turning away from Conservatives in droves.Who is Liz Truss, the U.K.’s new prime minister?“I’m ready to make the hard choices,” she said. She warned of “stormy days” ahead but insisted that Britain needs to “do things differently” and that “whenever there is change, there is disruption.”Advertisement“I am determined to take a new approach and break us out of this high-tax, low-growth cycle,” she told the party faithful gathered in Birmingham, England.Referring to the protesters later in her speech, she spoke dismissively about an “anti-growth coalition” made up of a broad swath of people in the country, including opposition politicians, “the militant unions, the vested interests dressed up as think tanks, the talking heads, the Brexit deniers, Extinction Rebellion and some of the people we had in the hall earlier.”The moment when Liz Truss’ speech is interrupted by Greenpeace protestors #ConservativePartyconference pic.twitter.com/YYRBMIPQLB— Karla Adam (@karlaadam) October 5, 2022

“The fact is they prefer protesting to doing. They prefer talking on Twitter to taking tough decisions,” she said. “They taxi from North London townhouses to the BBC studio to dismiss anyone challenging the status quo. From broadcast to podcast, they peddle the same old answers. It’s always more taxes, more regulation and more meddling. Wrong, wrong, wrong.”AdvertisementTruss came into office with a lot to prove. Although she had a somewhat prominent role as foreign secretary during the war in Ukraine, she wasn’t known to the British public the way Johnson — a colorful former mayor of London and newspaper columnist — had been before he took the helm.Truss was propelled not by a general election but by a leadership contest within her party. Even then, she wasn’t the first choice of Conservative Party lawmakers, and some of the grass-roots party members who rallied around her have admitted they already missed Johnson.Any momentum Truss had as incoming prime minister was cut short after two days by the death of Queen Elizabeth II. The new prime minister joined the new king in touring the four nations of the United Kingdom, but she played a marginal role.When attention eventually returned to politics, things took a dramatic turn for the worse. Her government’s plan to grow the economy through tax cuts primarily aimed at the wealthy, to be funded by billions in borrowing, sent investors scrambling to dump British assets. The pound sank to an all-time low against the dollar. The Bank of England had to intervene to quell a financial market revolt.Pound rebounds after U.K. government reverses part of tax policy that sent it plungingOnly after 10 days of economic turmoil and under intense pressure from her party did Truss reverse course, announcing Monday that she would abandon the most controversial element of her economic plan: a proposal to scrap the top rate of income tax.The pound has since rebounded. But divisions within the Conservative Party remain, as the conference proceedings this week have made clear. Home Secretary Suella Braverman on Tuesday lashed out at those within the party who “staged a coup” that “undermined the authority of our prime minister in an unprofessional way.”Meanwhile, public opinion of the Conservative Party has nosedived, falling by 20 to 30 points in the past two weeks.Advertisement“This is the most dramatic polling shift in my lifetime,” said Chris Curtis, head of political polling at Opinium research.The Conservatives have “lost the perception as them being the economically competent party — it’s as simple as that,” Curtis said.A poll published Tuesday night showed the opposition Labour Party leading the Conservatives by 38 points in the “red wall” areas in northern England that swung behind Conservatives in the 2019 election.If an election were held today, pollsters say the Labour Party would win its biggest majority.“What this shift in the polls shows is that the British electorate is increasingly volatile. It’s decreasingly aligned to party attachment. Voters will swing from one party to the next,” said Will Jennings, a professor of political science at the University of Southampton.U.K. facing massive train strikes, in new blow to Liz Truss’s governmentPolitics in Britain are much less polarized than in the United States. That’s partly because of Brexit, which prompted many people to walk away from parties they had supported for decades and to instead think of themselves as “leavers” or “remainers” — labels that crossed party lines. Now that Brexit is a done deal, voters are open to being swayed by other concerns.AdvertisementThat volatility means the pendulum could swing back and forth a number of times before the next election, which could be as far off as January 2025, and so neither the Conservative Party nor Truss is in immediate danger.Still, the Conservatives are known for ruthlessly ditching leaders who no longer seem like vote winners. Johnson was ousted halfway through his term in office, following a number of scandals, even though he led his party to a whopping majority in 2019.If Conservatives think Truss will drag them down, she could find herself booted out just like Johnson.“She’s in a vulnerable, delicate situation,” Jennings said. “If Conservatives stay at the current levels in the polls, [members of Parliament] will get very worried. One should never presume too much about political futures, but it’s certainly true she’s in a difficult spot. Recovering support of her MPs and voters will be a tremendous challenge.”",Karla Adam,U.K. Prime Minister Liz Truss defends first month in office amid protests

Earlier Wednesday, the president had signed the legislation to absorb the seized regions into Russia despite his lack of control.AdvertisementAs he spoke, the Russian leader gave no indication that his grip on the regions had already slipped. “Let me emphasize: Russia has been and will be sovereign,” he said, adding: “Above all, it is necessary to convey the moral cultural code of the Russian people to the children and exclude attempts to impose alien and perverted interpretations of history.”Highlighting the contradiction of Putin’s claim that Russia will remain in the four annexed eastern Ukrainian regions “forever” and the reality on the ground, however, the president’s spokesman conceded Wednesday that “certain areas” in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions were under Kyiv’s control and still needed to be retaken by Russia.“Control will be regained, nonetheless, over certain territories there, and we will continue to consult with that part of the population expressing the desire to live with Russia,” the spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said in a conference call with reporters.Putin faces limits of his military power as Ukraine recaptures landThe veneer Putin hoped to create of a successful annexation, absorbing four Ukrainian regions back into the “Fatherland,” was shattering amid ongoing criticism of his botched military mobilization aimed at calling up 300,000 new troops and glum, defeated reports of new battlefield losses by hawkish military correspondents with massive online audiences.Advertisement“Friends, I know that you expect me to comment on the situation, but I really don’t know what to tell you,” pro-Russian military reporter Roman Saponkov wrote on Telegram about Russian losses along the Dnieper River. “The retreat from the north of the right bank in the Kherson region is a disaster.”“Vysokopillya, Lyubimovka, Velyka Oleksandrivka, Davydov Grid, these places have been showered with the blood of our soldiers,” Saponkov added, listing key towns in Kherson that the Ukrainian army captured in just the past 48 hours.Just a month after Russian forces were routed from the northeast Kharkiv region in a lightning offensive, Ukrainian troops have made gains in Donetsk, and are pushing into Luhansk, the region where Russia had its strongest control.As Moscow acknowledged its defenses in the south had been breached, Russian audiences saw tense exchanges on television as top propagandists struggled to explain why the Russian military was experiencing setback after setback, and to manufacture some optimism.Advertisement“We have lost 17 settlements in the Kherson region,” Alexander Sladkov, a war reporter with Russia 1 state channel, said on air during one of the main talk shows, “60 Minutes.”“This is concerning, to say the least. Why there was no cover there?” the host, Olga Skabeeva, responded.“We are waiting for the reinforcement, it is coming, but if we throw them into battle now, pardon me, what will happen to them?” Sladkov said. “If we mobilized 300,000 people at the beginning of the war, when we had heavy casualties, we would’ve spent them, too. Now it’s different; we understand now that a soldier has to be prepared.”“When will there be positive changes for Russia?” Skabeeva asked.“If we are talking about big, significant offensives, I would say two months,” Sladkov replied.For fresh manpower, Putin is betting on the tens of thousands of mobilized men to shore up the depleted ranks of units fighting in Ukraine and grant leave to exhausted soldiers, some of whom haven’t been rotated out since the start of the invasion in February.Advertisement“In many sectors of the front line, fatigue has sunk in after a long offensive period, during which large territories were liberated,” Alexander Kots, a military correspondent for Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper, wrote Tuesday on his Telegram blog. “But there is no longer any strength left to hold them.”‘I refuse to comply,’ says Russian journalist, days after escaping house arrestWestern military experts say the Russian leader may be running out of time to turn around his ailing invasion and is facing a difficult choice: spend more time training the reinforcements but risk allowing Ukraine to advance its counteroffensive further, or throw the mobilized men into battle quickly in hopes that they will be able to hold ground despite some having little to no combat experience.But there was continuing evidence that the mobilization is not going well.Roman Starovoit, the governor of the Kursk region in western Russia, which is one of the key staging grounds for the invasion, described the state of some military units he recently toured as “awful.”Advertisement“I cannot understand how an active training unit of the Ministry of Defense can be in such a condition,” Starovoit said. “A ruined canteen, broken and rusty showers, lack of beds, and the existing ones are broken.”“There is a lack of uniforms, the parade ground looks as if it had been bombed,” the governor added. “It is good that at least there is equipment and weapons to refresh the skills and improve professionalism.”Officially, the Russian Defense Ministry has said the newly called-up soldiers will receive “up to one month of training.” But there have been multiple reports of military commissariats deploying soldiers to the front just days after they were summoned.The problems with the mobilization, which was announced just two weeks ago, snowballed so quickly that more than 20 Russian regional governors resorted to a rare public admission that mistakes had been made, and they carried out several public dismissals of enlistment officers.AdvertisementThere have been widespread reports of men unfit to serve being called to duty, including some who are blind, deaf, disabled or elderly.In a speech Wednesday, Putin accused the Defense Ministry of not cementing exemptions for students, professionals of key industries, and other people in the call-up regulations.“Initially, the Ministry of Defense reported that several categories of our citizens did not need to be called up as part of mobilization, but they still did not make the relevant changes to the regulations,” Putin said during a meeting with a group of teachers. “We now have to make appropriate corrections.”At least nine mobilized soldiers died even before they got to the battlefield, some of heart ailments, further raising questions about how enlistment officers are adhering to health criteria for recruits. Others died under murky circumstances. Local media reported that a young man died Sunday at a training site in Krasnoyarsk after a conflict between him and other men at the site.AdvertisementThree men from one garrison in the Sverdlovsk region died: one of a heart attack, and another by suicide; and a third, after he had been sent home, succumbed to liver failure linked to excessive alcohol consumption, an official told local news outlet EA News.Here are the nuclear weapons Russia has in its arsenalThese deaths reveal deeper issues in the mobilization efforts, linked to low morale and abysmal conditions in some training centers, where mobilized men sometimes have to sleep on the floor and where the Defense Ministry apparently lacks such basic provisions as socks, adequate food and uniforms.“Our guys need thermal underwear, warm socks, gloves, cigarettes, sugar, and canned meat,” a message read in one of the groups on Vkontakte, a social media site, organized by mothers and wives of Russian soldiers to crowdsource gear the men need.“My husband has just asked for these combat boots,” Anna, whose husband was recently called up, wrote in a Vkontakte chatroom.Natalia Abbakumova in Riga, Latvia, and Robyn Dixon contributed to this report.",Mary Ilyushina,Putin cites success in annexed regions even as his exhausted troops retreat
5,"LONDON — Prime Minister Liz Truss on Wednesday sought to shore up her authority after a brutal first month in office by asserting that while not everyone favors the changes her new government is pushing, “everyone will benefit from the result — a growing economy and a better future.”Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine.ArrowRightBut just moments into her keynote speech to the annual Conservative Party conference, she was interrupted by Greenpeace protesters carrying a banner that read: “Who voted for this?” They were quickly removed from the hall.British Prime Minister Liz Truss was heckled by two protesters holding a Greenpeace banner during her speech in Birmingham, England, on Oct. 5. (Video: Reuters)The Conservative Party conference, featuring a new prime minister, was a moment the party had hoped would mark a fresh start after the many scandals of her predecessor, Boris Johnson. Instead, Truss had to defend the first weeks of her premiership, already marked by historic economic volatility, a revolt within her party and voters turning away from Conservatives in droves.Who is Liz Truss, the U.K.’s new prime minister?“I’m ready to make the hard choices,” she said. She warned of “stormy days” ahead but insisted that Britain needs to “do things differently” and that “whenever there is change, there is disruption.”Advertisement“I am determined to take a new approach and break us out of this high-tax, low-growth cycle,” she told the party faithful gathered in Birmingham, England.Referring to the protesters later in her speech, she spoke dismissively about an “anti-growth coalition” made up of a broad swath of people in the country, including opposition politicians, “the militant unions, the vested interests dressed up as think tanks, the talking heads, the Brexit deniers, Extinction Rebellion and some of the people we had in the hall earlier.”The moment when Liz Truss’ speech is interrupted by Greenpeace protestors #ConservativePartyconference pic.twitter.com/YYRBMIPQLB— Karla Adam (@karlaadam) October 5, 2022

“The fact is they prefer protesting to doing. They prefer talking on Twitter to taking tough decisions,” she said. “They taxi from North London townhouses to the BBC studio to dismiss anyone challenging the status quo. From broadcast to podcast, they peddle the same old answers. It’s always more taxes, more regulation and more meddling. Wrong, wrong, wrong.”AdvertisementTruss came into office with a lot to prove. Although she had a somewhat prominent role as foreign secretary during the war in Ukraine, she wasn’t known to the British public the way Johnson — a colorful former mayor of London and newspaper columnist — had been before he took the helm.Truss was propelled not by a general election but by a leadership contest within her party. Even then, she wasn’t the first choice of Conservative Party lawmakers, and some of the grass-roots party members who rallied around her have admitted they already missed Johnson.Any momentum Truss had as incoming prime minister was cut short after two days by the death of Queen Elizabeth II. The new prime minister joined the new king in touring the four nations of the United Kingdom, but she played a marginal role.When attention eventually returned to politics, things took a dramatic turn for the worse. Her government’s plan to grow the economy through tax cuts primarily aimed at the wealthy, to be funded by billions in borrowing, sent investors scrambling to dump British assets. The pound sank to an all-time low against the dollar. The Bank of England had to intervene to quell a financial market revolt.Pound rebounds after U.K. government reverses part of tax policy that sent it plungingOnly after 10 days of economic turmoil and under intense pressure from her party did Truss reverse course, announcing Monday that she would abandon the most controversial element of her economic plan: a proposal to scrap the top rate of income tax.The pound has since rebounded. But divisions within the Conservative Party remain, as the conference proceedings this week have made clear. Home Secretary Suella Braverman on Tuesday lashed out at those within the party who “staged a coup” that “undermined the authority of our prime minister in an unprofessional way.”Meanwhile, public opinion of the Conservative Party has nosedived, falling by 20 to 30 points in the past two weeks.Advertisement“This is the most dramatic polling shift in my lifetime,” said Chris Curtis, head of political polling at Opinium research.The Conservatives have “lost the perception as them being the economically competent party — it’s as simple as that,” Curtis said.A poll published Tuesday night showed the opposition Labour Party leading the Conservatives by 38 points in the “red wall” areas in northern England that swung behind Conservatives in the 2019 election.If an election were held today, pollsters say the Labour Party would win its biggest majority.“What this shift in the polls shows is that the British electorate is increasingly volatile. It’s decreasingly aligned to party attachment. Voters will swing from one party to the next,” said Will Jennings, a professor of political science at the University of Southampton.U.K. facing massive train strikes, in new blow to Liz Truss’s governmentPolitics in Britain are much less polarized than in the United States. That’s partly because of Brexit, which prompted many people to walk away from parties they had supported for decades and to instead think of themselves as “leavers” or “remainers” — labels that crossed party lines. Now that Brexit is a done deal, voters are open to being swayed by other concerns.AdvertisementThat volatility means the pendulum could swing back and forth a number of times before the next election, which could be as far off as January 2025, and so neither the Conservative Party nor Truss is in immediate danger.Still, the Conservatives are known for ruthlessly ditching leaders who no longer seem like vote winners. Johnson was ousted halfway through his term in office, following a number of scandals, even though he led his party to a whopping majority in 2019.If Conservatives think Truss will drag them down, she could find herself booted out just like Johnson.“She’s in a vulnerable, delicate situation,” Jennings said. “If Conservatives stay at the current levels in the polls, [members of Parliament] will get very worried. One should never presume too much about political futures, but it’s certainly true she’s in a difficult spot. Recovering support of her MPs and voters will be a tremendous challenge.”",Karla Adam,U.K. Prime Minister Liz Truss defends first month in office amid protests
6,"As Russia’s military retreats on the battlefield, Vladimir Putin’s rhetoric about using nuclear weapons is escalating.Russia’s president has been warning of nuclear consequences with increasing intensity since the first week of his war in Ukraine — when he put his arsenal on higher alert. Now he is threatening to use nuclear weapons to defend the Ukrainian territory that Russia has illegally annexed.Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine.ArrowRight“This is not a bluff,” he warned the West. “And those who try to blackmail us with nuclear weapons should know that the weather vane can turn and point toward them.”What if Putin isn’t bluffing? What sort of nuclear strike is Russia, the country with the world’s largest stockpile of nuclear weapons, capable of — and what kind of destruction might it wreak in Ukraine and beyond?“Nuclear weapons, they’re unlike any other weapon,” said Joe Cirincione, a nuclear weapons expert who previously served as president of the Ploughshares Fund. “And that’s just the explosive part — not to mention the thermal effects and the temperatures that are produced.”AdvertisementIt is very unlikely that Russia would use its most powerful nuclear weapons to settle scores with Kyiv; Moscow is far more likely, experts agree, to use a smaller nuclear weapon in the hopes of achieving a specific battlefield objective. But, those same experts caution, once a nuclear weapon is unleashed, controlling what happens next is difficult.“Once you start talking nukes, all bets are off,” said Hans Kristensen, the director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists. “So it’s not clear how far this will go.”How many weapons?The first and most basic question about the Russian nuclear arsenal is: How many of the weapons does Russia have? It is a difficult one to answer.Nuclear weapons are commonly divided into two categories: strategic weapons — those being the longer-range missiles that can cross oceans and threaten rival superpowers — and tactical weapons, those that have a more limited capacity and arguably could serve a more limited function.AdvertisementThe United States has a good count of Russia’s strategic weapons, because Washington and Moscow are required to disclose this under the terms of New START, the last remaining arms control treaty. That count of strategic weapons is split among those deployed on intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) and those launched from bombers.But when it comes to the tactical weapons, the U.S. intelligence community can only offer its best guess, and different agencies have differing estimates. The ballpark figure they have settled on is between 1,000 and 2,000 tactical weapons (which, it should be noted, can be launched from ground launchers, ships and bombers but are not pre-deployed). After careful study, the Federation of American Scientists put its estimate at 1,912 — although it cautions that this could include weapons being retired or taken offline.How powerful are these weapons?The power of a nuclear weapon is its yield, and yield is measured as a TNT equivalent. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that the American bombs that were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki had yields of 15 and 21 kilotons, respectively — so equivalent to 15,000 tons and 21,000 tons of TNT.AdvertisementModern strategic nuclear weapons have enormous power. Standard ones can have yields of 500 kilotons, 800 kilotons and even 1 megaton — equivalent to 1 million tons of TNT. Russia holds the record for the most powerful weapon ever exploded: In 1961, it tested a bomb of at least 50 megatons, nicknamed “Tsar Bomba” — or the tsar of all bombs.In 2020, Russia released classified footage of the world's largest nuclear explosion, caused when the Soviet Union detonated the ""Tsar Bomba"" in October 1961. (Video: Reuters)Modern tactical weapons usually have a capacity of 10 to 100 kilotons, which still makes the average tactical weapon potentially more destructive than the bombs used on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Russia and the United States also have “low-yield” nuclear weapons that pack a “light” punch, even dipping below 1 kiloton. But even the least-powerful nuclear bomb — with a yield of about 0.3 kilotons — has about the same explosive power as the 2020 Beirut port explosion.What weapons would Russia be most likely to use?Russia has various kinds of tactical nuclear weapons. Some are designed for use by the navy, some to be used by the air force and others to be used by the army, either in surface-to-surface short-range missiles or in surface-to-air air defenses. The yield varies by purpose, since it takes more power to penetrate, say, an underground bunker than it does to stop an incoming warplane.AdvertisementRussia has different-size stocks of all these weapons. For example, the Federation of American Scientists believes Russia has about 500 tactical air force nuclear weapons, a figure that includes gravity bombs and air-to-surface cruise missiles. Many of those would be delivered by aircraft that we have seen on conventional bombing missions in Ukraine. These planes include the Tu-22 “Backfire” bomber that Russia has used to strike  Ukraine and the Su-34 “Fullback,” one of which Ukraine claimed to have shot down last month. But experts do not think the Russians are necessarily going to use those.The Russian Defense Ministry released footage on June 14 it says shows an Iskander missile system engaged in conventional battle in Ukraine. (Video: Associated Press)A far more likely candidate is the 9K720 Iskander missile system, classified by NATO as the SS-26, which is a ground-based ballistic missile. But according to Kristensen of the Federation of American Scientists, there are far fewer of these in Russia’s arsenal — only about 100 weapons. So why would Iskander be the nuclear delivery system of choice?“Simply because it’s the most reliable, and the one that would have the best chance of making it to its target,” Kristensen said. “Not being shot down, not failing.”Advertisement

How much destruction can these weapons cause?The first metric to pay attention to when estimating the destructive capacity of a nuclear weapon is its yield. If the kilotons number is bigger, the blast is going to be bigger, all else being equal. But all else is usually not equal. Terrain can be a factor — if there are hills in the area of the blast, they can buffer some of the radiating effects of the blast. If the target and the blast occur underground, the ground itself can absorb some of the blow. And whether the weapon is detonated on a surface or a just above the surface can also make a huge difference.

There are also the radiation, radioactive debris and long-term poisoning affects to worry about. But according to Kristensen, there are ways to avoid this impact if people in the blast area take proper shelter, which may not be available in a war zone.Advertisement“If you go down in your basement and you stay there with your ventilation system turned off for three to four days, then most of the acute radiation will have disappeared, so that you’re able to at least go out,” he said. But while people might be able to breathe more easily at that point, they will still have to make sure their food and water supply haven’t been compromised.Will there be a warning?History and Hollywood have instilled in our imaginations the image of world leaders with their fingers hovering over a big nuclear button, just one false flinch or sneeze away from lighting the world on nuclear fire. While the major strategic weapons can be launched within minutes of an order being given, that is not the case for Russia’s tactical weapons.Those weapons are stored at a limited number of facilities around the country, from which they have to be removed and transported. That process takes days, according to the experts. And those movements would probably be detected by U.S. and European intelligence services.AdvertisementThey will be watching for things like the mobilization of military units that aren’t usually active; an increased presence of strategic forces; and more trucks or trains appearing to move toward Ukraine from the locations where officials know such weapons are stored. In recent days, reports of armored train cars moving through central Russia caused a stir and some worried they were witnessing the first sign of a nuclear attack. But so far, the experts aren’t flinching.“Read that with an enormous grain of salt, because there are also all sorts of reasons for why the vehicles could be on those trucks,” Kristensen said, noting that U.S. intelligence agencies were strikingly quiet — which would not be the case if a nuclear attack on Ukraine were imminent.",Karoun Demirjian,Here are the nuclear weapons Russia has in its arsenal
7,"A coalition of oil-producing nations led by Russia and Saudi Arabia announced Wednesday it will slash oil production by 2 million barrels per day, in a rebuke to President Biden that could push up gas prices worldwide, worsen the risk of a global recession and bolster Russia in its war in Ukraine.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightThe move by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its partners prompted a blistering reaction from White House officials and reverberated almost immediately through domestic and global financial markets, threatening higher energy costs for the United States and European countries already grappling with inflation and economic instability.The cut to production also amplifies geopolitical tensions at a precarious moment for the world’s major powers. Biden administration officials had launched an extraordinary effort to press Saudi Arabia to produce more oil to compensate for the global shortage caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with the president personally visiting Saudi leaders in a trip to Jiddah. With this move, Saudi Arabia has rejected those entreaties at least in part, leaving senior White House officials contemplating their next steps and publicly hinting at unprecedented measures to undercut the gulf nation’s grip on international energy markets.AdvertisementRussia will benefit from the cut, because lower production will increase the price of oil — helping Moscow finance its war effort in Ukraine. And it could further test Europe’s resolve to support Ukraine ahead of what economists project will be a sharp slowdown in economic growth throughout the continent. American consumers could also be strained by higher gas prices, potentially imperiling the Biden administration’s determination to lower gas costs ahead of the 2022 midterm elections.This would be the first time the group cut oil production targets since the beginning of the pandemic. And it’s more aggressive than many analysts had expected even a few days ago. The OPEC Plus coalition, which is led by crude-oil giant Saudi Arabia, said the cut in production would take effect in November. OPEC Plus said in a statement the move was necessary to stabilize the recent fall in global energy prices.“The President is disappointed by the shortsighted decision by OPEC Plus to cut production quotas while the global economy is dealing with the continued negative impact of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine,” U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan and National Economic Council Director Brian Deese said in a statement.AdvertisementThe statement added that the administration will consult with Congress on additional mechanisms “to reduce OPEC’s control over energy prices” — suggesting the U.S. policymakers could be interested in repealing a long-standing exemption to federal antitrust law that allows the consortium to effectively coordinate on prices. If executed, that move would in turn elicit fierce pushback from Saudi Arabia and its allies, analysts say.U.S. economy stumbles into final stretch of 2022 facing new pressures“This clearly portends the potential for higher oil prices, reinforcing recessionary forces in the global economy and heightening risks for global financial instability,” said Mark Sobel, a former senior Treasury Department official.Energy stocks climbed slightly on the news, contrasting with declines in the overall financial markets. The immediate impact on gas prices remained unclear. Claudio Galimberti, head of Americas analysis at Rystad Energy, said gas prices are likely to increase in the United States perhaps by roughly 10 percent in much of the country, though the actual increase will depend on many factors.Advertisement“The intention of the OPEC Plus cut was to break the fall in crude prices since the summer,” said Bob McNally, an energy analyst at the Rapidan Energy Group. “If they succeed, then gasoline pump prices should also stop falling and range around current levels, until other market drivers impact the price.”The cuts come despite aggressive lobbying by the Biden administration for the consortium to continue production at current levels or higher — punctuated by Biden’s visit to Saudi Arabia in July. Biden had earlier in his administration vowed to make Saudi Arabia an international pariah, but he re-engaged while trying to use all available channels to curb increases in the price of gas that had hurt his domestic approval ratings. The administration had sought to isolate Saudi Arabia in part because of its human rights record.The production cuts could lead to considerable political fallout in the United States, where midterm elections will be held in just over a month. Falling gas prices this summer played a big role in lifting the political fortunes of Democrats, who face a tough election season. They also helped elevate Biden’s approval rating and gave the party a glimmer of hope for blunting a widely anticipated red wave in November.Americans are finally feeling better about the economy, partly because of easing gas pricesThe OPEC coalition’s move could also add to inflationary pressures in the United States and Europe, as well as undercut the effort to bolster Ukraine as it defends itself against the Russian invasion. Russia relies on gas and oil sales for a large portion of its budget and had pushed for the production cut, which will enable Moscow to sell oil for higher prices on the global market, generating more revenue for its war and troop mobilization.AdvertisementOil prices jumped this week in anticipation of today’s news. They are expected to increase further now, probably to over $100 per barrel.The Biden administration waged a last minute push to persuade Middle East allies not to dramatically cut oil production ahead of the meeting, according to senior administration officials. That effort, involving senior-level discussions with foreign counterparts, was seen internally as a long shot.One White House official quibbled with the suggestion that the Biden administration waged a major push to dissuade countries such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates from cutting production, saying it was a “minor effort.” Other officials said it was a more significant push but acknowledged that Biden was not making calls on the matter.In the Ukraine war, a battle for the nation’s mineral and energy wealth“A large supply cut would delight Moscow, which would benefit from both stabilized if not higher crude prices and an implicit sign of solidarity from its OPEC Plus colleagues as it braces for looming E.U. oil sanctions‚” McNally said before the cut was announced.The OPEC Plus coalition said it was making the move “in light of the uncertainty that surrounds the global economic and oil market outlooks, and the need to enhance the long-term guidance for the oil market, and in line with the successful approach of being proactive, and preemptive, which has been consistently adopted” by the group.AdvertisementBefore the OPEC Plus meeting, gas prices were already up sharply in some areas of the United States where there are several hotly contested congressional races, as well as close races for governor. Those increases were propelled by maintenance at refineries on the West Coast and a large fire at a refinery in the Midwest.Nevada, Washington, Oregon and Alaska have all seen prices jump by at least 40 cents a gallon over the past week. Throughout swing states in the Midwest, the increase has been less severe, but enough for drivers to notice the pain. In California, where there are at least eight close congressional races, prices jumped 62 cents over the last week to $6.38 per gallon of gasoline.As gas prices rise, Democrats scramble to lay blame on Big OilWhile the White House has little control over the price of gas, which is guided by global markets, Biden has more actively engaged on the matter than many of his predecessors. That includes his order to release 1 million barrels of oil per day from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, an action that helped lower prices but now makes the United States even more vulnerable to cost increases as it faces the challenge of replenishing.AdvertisementThe administration has already extended the release of that reserve oil into November. But the potential production cuts by OPEC Plus suggest the United States may not be able to restock at the lower prices administration officials had hoped.“We will continue to take steps to protect American consumers,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Tuesday, ahead of the announcement. “Our focus — and it’s been very clear for the past several months — has been on taking every step to ensure markets are sufficiently supplied to meet demand for a growing global economy.”She added, “Energy prices have declined sharply from their highs and American consumers are paying far less at the pump than they were several months ago.”However, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) told CNBC in an interview the cut in production should lead to a “wholesale reevaluation of the U.S. alliance with Saudi Arabia,” adding that Biden’s visit this year did not yield the necessary results from Riyadh. “When the chips are down, the Saudis effectively choose the Russians instead of the United States,” he said. “We need them right now.”U.S. economy stumbles into final stretch of 2022 facing new pressuresThe increasingly challenging realities of the global energy market are certain to raise tensions between the Biden administration and large oil producers. Biden and other Democrats have been repeatedly attacking oil companies for reaping record profits at a time when consumers are struggling to pay for a tank of gas.AdvertisementEnergy Secretary Jennifer Granholm has previously put oil companies on notice that the administration could use emergency powers to curb exports if the firms do not put more emphasis on boosting their domestic inventories. Oil executives and industry experts have warned such a curb on exports could backfire, tightening the global supply even further and discouraging investment in increased production.As the OPEC Plus production cut loomed, the leaders of the American Petroleum Institute and American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers sent Granholm a five-page letter on Tuesday warning that restrictions on exports “would likely decrease inventory levels, reduce domestic refining capacity, put upward pressure on consumer fuel prices, and alienate U.S. allies during a time of war.”Evan Halper, Adela Suliman and Amar Nadhir contributed to this report.",Jeff Stein,"Saudi Arabia, Russia defy U.S. with oil production cut as tensions rise"
8,"The unofficial anthem of Iran’s ongoing anti-government protests is a soulful song, with lyrics strung together from tweets sent out by demonstrators risking their lives to defy the country’s ruling clerics.Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine.ArrowRight“Because of dancing in the streets,” the song begins. In Iran, dancing in public is banned.“Because of every time we were afraid to kiss our lovers.”“Because of the embarrassment of an empty pocket.”“Because of yearning for a normal life.”Other lyrics name corruption, censorship, gender discrimination, environmental degradation and national tragedies, such as the near extinction of the Persian cheetah and the downing of a Ukrainian passenger plane in 2020, in what Iran’s government has said was a military accident.“Because of women, life, freedom,” the song concludes, echoing a popular protest chant: “Azadi.” Freedom.What’s behind the protests in Iran?Iranian singer Shervin Hajipour posted the song, “Baraye” — which means “for the sake of” or “because of” — to his Instagram account on Sept. 28. It accrued more than 40 million views, according to Amin Sabeti, a London-based expert on Iranian cybersecurity, by the time authorities forced Hajipour to take it down and arrested him the following day.AdvertisementThe song, according to Iranians interviewed by The Washington Post, gives voice to sentiments that have driven widespread anger and the largest anti-government protests the country has seen in years, which began with the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody in Tehran last month, and which have come to encompass a broad range of frustrations uniting Iranians fed up with grinding poverty, repression, gender segregation and human rights violations.Hajipour, 25, was released on bail Tuesday, according to Iranian state media. His lawyer did not respond to requests for comment. In an Instagram post after his release, Hajipour thanked his supporters and expressed his love for Iran, vowing not to leave. Some Iranians, however, suspected that his message, which included a line in which he denounced how his song was used politically outside the country, was forced. “Because of forced confession,” some tweeted in response.By then, “Baraye” had become ubiquitous across Iran and online platforms.AdvertisementHajipour’s arrest came as part of a brutal crackdown on the weeks-long protests. Authorities have killed more than 130 protesters, according to rights groups, arrested and injured thousands more, and cut off or slowed internet access across much of the country.“The song puts decades of depression, hurt and anger into simple words,” said Sarah, a 32-year-old fashion designer in Tehran who runs her business on Instagram. She would give only her first name, out of concern for her safety.As Iran protests persist, supreme leader blames foreigners for unrestSarah said she hears Hajipour’s “lullaby of hope” everywhere: played on mobile phones at protests, blasted from cars, sung by passersby in the streets, shouted from rooftops, chanted at schools and offices, and streamed across social media.“Shervin’s arrest [has] made the song even more popular because the injustice of this action has enraged people,” said Saeed Souzangar, a 34-year-old managing director of a technology company in Tehran. “This song is eternal and the anthem of the revolution, and no matter how much the system tries to stop it from being played, the more you will hear it.”AdvertisementSouzangar said Monday that he and his colleagues were spending much of their time either protesting — an experience, he said, that felt like “bungee jumping” — or searching for friends in detention.“My generation didn’t get to live freely in this country,” Souzangar said. “I want future generations to be spared from the psychological and emotional torture we experienced.”He told The Post on Monday that two friends had just been arrested for “spreading information about the protests,” and he did not know their whereabouts.On Tuesday morning Tehran time, Souzangar said he had been called in for questioning. He stopped responding to text messages.“This time, small concessions are not going to work,” he said Monday, referring to chants calling for an end to clerical rule. “Now, all these different groups in Iran have become one, and they have one demand.”For Iranian exiles, Mahsa Amini protests are a source of hope and painEvery wave of political change in Iran has been defined by key songs, slogans and media, said Negar Mottahedeh, a professor of Middle Eastern studies and film and media studies at Duke University. During major protests in 2009, sparked by concerns about election fraud, Twitter and hashtags became a key mobilizing tool in Iran and abroad.AdvertisementDespite the internet crackdown, Hajipour’s song has been able “to move quickly and change people’s hearts and minds,” a significant step even if it does not fundamentally alter the political system, she said.“Even if these protests die tomorrow, Hajipour’s song will continue to be a form of defiance and heard in every protest to come,” said Holly Dagres, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, a Washington think tank.Some of the lines of “Baraye” directly echo chants in the streets.“Because of my sister, your sister, our sister,” Hajipour sings, alluding to Amini, the woman whose death — in the custody of police who detained her for an alleged violation of Iran’s strict dress code for women — set off the protests.“For the ruins of poorly built homes,” another lines goes, in reference to the May collapse of a poorly built 10-story commercial building in Iran’s southwestern Khuzestan province. The catastrophe left the country grief-stricken and fueled weeks of anti-government and anti-corruption protests.AdvertisementTina, a 29-year-old from Iran’s Khuzestan province living in Tehran, who also spoke on the condition that only her first name would be used, said one line — “for forced heaven,” strictly enforced Islamic law — resonated the most.“This one signified all the years of oppression, violence and humiliation we woman have been living with in Iran, forcing us to follow rules that we don’t even believe in,” she said.Tina said that she works at a private company and that she and her colleagues play “Baraye” several times a day.In recent weeks while attending protests, she said, she has felt an intense sense of power and unity. But she has been left with a broken heart, she said, because Iran’s leaders are using violence against the unrest.Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, made his first public statements Monday, deriding demonstrators as agents of the West and “thugs, robbers and extortionists.” When protests broke out in 2019, sparked by a rise in fuel prices, the government shut the internet down for 12 days. Hundreds of people, by other estimates more than 1,000, died.“We are defenseless; no one cares about us except ourselves,” Tina said. “Most of the casualties are so young. … We are fighting this fight alone and with all of our might.”“Each ‘Baraye’ speaks to the pain and frustration that Iranians have been suffering,” she said.correction An earlier version of this article misspelled Amin Sabeti’s name.

After Russia’s February invasion, media access was swiftly blocked and Moscow banned what it deemed to be “fake” news of its assault on Ukraine.

10,"An energy supply crunch tied to the war in Ukraine could cause widespread blackouts in the European Union this winter, an official in charge of managing crises within the bloc has warned.The European Union is shoring up its resources as temperatures drop and preparing for two “conceivable scenarios”: One in which a few member states experience power cuts, and another in which blackouts occur in many member states at the same time, E.U. Crisis Management Commissioner Janez Lenarcic told Germany’s RND media.Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine.ArrowRightIn the first scenario, E.U. states could step in to provide targeted help to affected countries, including emergency power generators. But in the case of more widespread blackouts, the European Commission would be forced to draw from its strategic energy reserve, while individual countries would cap their emergency aid deliveries, Lenarcic added.How Europe is responding to Russia’s ‘energy war’ as winter comesEuropean officials insist they are better prepared for what’s to come than at the start of the war in Ukraine, with stores of natural gas in the E.U. at nearly 90 percent of capacity — 15 percent higher than the same day last year. Still, more needs to be done to ensure the bloc can quickly respond to “sudden disruptions” in energy supply, and to “better protect” critical networks in the E.U., European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a speech to the European Parliament on Wednesday.AdvertisementLenarcic’s comments on European readiness comes just ahead of an informal E.U. summit in the Czech Republic, where leaders will debate how to protect critical infrastructure following attacks on the Nord Stream pipelines built to deliver gas from Russia to Europe, as well as emergency measures to control soaring electricity prices.“The acts of sabotage against Nord Stream pipelines have shown how vulnerable our energy infrastructure is,” von der Leyen said. “It is in the interest of all Europeans to better protect [it].”Member states will also continue to debate if and how to cap the price of gas.E.U. urges gas rationing ahead of ‘likely’ cutoff by RussiaWhile blackouts are common in many parts of the world where the infrastructure is not able to withstand surges in demand, they are largely foreign to wealthy European countries — and experts have been sounding alarm bells about what power cuts could mean for consumers, including mobile network outages.AdvertisementCities across Germany took steps this summer to conserve energy, including by shutting off the lights at historic monuments and turning off public fountains. In France, luxury giant LVMH said it would turn off the lights at its stores earlier at night starting in October, and Paris has begun shutting the Eiffel Tower’s lights off shortly before midnight, instead of at 1 a.m.Experts say some of these moves are largely symbolic — the Eiffel Tower’s nighttime consumption of electricity is equivalent to the annual electricity consumption of just 56 French people, according to Radio France.But other effects could hit consumers harder: Last week, Reuters reported that some European telecoms businesses fear power cuts this winter could cause outages in mobile networks. In September, France’s power-grid operator said there will be times in the next six months when it will probably have to ask consumers to use less energy — typically by 1 to 5 percent, but up to 15 percent in extreme weather — to avoid overloading the system.Berlin’s landmarks go dark as Germany races to save energy for winter“The Russian war causes economic and social hardship,” von der Leyen said Wednesday. “Rising energy prices … are leading to reduced purchasing power and they are leading to a loss of competitiveness for our businesses in the international market.”AdvertisementThe war in Ukraine has caused a major upheaval in the way the E.U. procures its energy. Over a third of European electricity is generated by burning fossil fuels, including coal, oil and natural gas. Until recently, Russia was the bloc’s main supplier of crude oil and gas. But Russia has drastically reduced gas deliveries to European countries in recent months in response to the bloc imposing sanctions on Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine, forcing the E.U. to look for alternate suppliers, build its reserves and take steps to reduce consumption.The E.U. now imports about 7.5 percent of its gas from Russia, down from 41 percent at the start of the war, von der Leyen said Wednesday.E.U. accuses Russia of ‘blackmail’ after gas cut to Poland, BulgariaIn Germany, the risk of a national natural gas shortage this winter had gone down thanks to gas stockpiling, Eurasia Group, a political risk research and consulting firm, said in a note. However, it warned that “short, regional, and controlled electricity cuts (known as load shedding)” were “emerging as an increasing risk, especially in southern parts of the country.”Load shedding, the group noted, is less harmful to the economy “than uncontrolled blackouts or a gas emergency, as advance notice allows industry and households to prepare for temporary and localized outages.”",Annabelle Timsit,"The E.U. is preparing for blackouts this winter, amid an energy crisis"
11,"A lauded Scandinavian chess player was so angered by an opponent’s behavior during a game that he took drastic action.King Cnut, who ruled England, Denmark and Norway in the 11th century, was playing against an earl named Ulf in Roskilde when he made a move that broke the rules — prompting his noble opponent to overturn the chessboard and leave the room.Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine.ArrowRight“Ulf, you coward, are you running away?” Cnut called out, according to Snorri Sturluson, the great Icelandic poet and chronicler of the era.“You would have taken a longer flight in the river Helga, if I did not help you when the Swedes beat you like a dog; then you did not then call me ‘Ulf the coward,’” Ulf, the husband of Cnut’s sister and an important military ally, responded.Ulf was murdered the following day.A millennium later, chess games are still ending abruptly and in controversy, but with less bloodshed and more gossip on Twitter and Twitch.AdvertisementLast month, Norwegian world chess grandmaster Magnus Carlsen withdrew from an online tournament match after making just one move against a 19-year-old American, Hans Niemann.The resignation came shortly after Carlsen, considered by many to be the greatest chess player of all time, unexpectedly lost to Niemann in another tournament game, ending a 53-game winning streak.Carlsen later issued a statement, which included accusations that Niemann, who has acknowledged cheating in previous online games when he was younger, had “cheated more — and more recently — than he has publicly admitted.”“I believe that cheating in chess is a big deal and an existential threat to the game,” the 31-year-old wrote.Carlsen also said that Niemann, who has denied the allegations, received mentorship from player Maxim Dlugy, who was suspended from Chess.com in 2017 over supposed cheating.AdvertisementThe Norwegian player’s claims gained new momentum this week: On Tuesday, Chess.com released details of an investigation into Niemann which found the American may have cheated in more than 100 games on the online platform until he was banned in 2020The accusations shook the chess world, but they were nothing new: Chess has long been a game rife with allegations of chicanery and skulduggery. Cheating at chess is as old as the game itself. But as King Cnut demonstrated, the consequences of such accusations can be severe — with implications that can extend even to international politics.Perspective: When chess is hard and cheating is easy, the next move is complicatedAncient rivalriesThe full origins of chess are not known for sure, but it has roots in the Gupta Empire, in what is now India, where a game called chaturanga flourished in the 6th century.Like modern chess, it involved a black and white checkered board. It was modeled on warfare, with pieces representing infantry, as well as chariots and elephants.AdvertisementThe game soon spread, along trade routes and by wars of conquest. It went east, where it was adapted to the modern game of xiangqi or Chinese chess, as well as east to Persia and the Arab world.Cnut led an Anglo-Scandinavian empire that was built on centuries of Viking trade and raids, likely bringing the game back.But it was likely known in Europe at least a century or two before the murder of poor Ulf. Historian H.J.R. Murray suggested in his 1913 book “A History of Chess” that the game was probably introduced to Spain or Italy via Muslim traders.Even in these early stages, the game is known to have caused conflict. Murray’s book contains multiple instances of disputes among the royals, nobles and clergy who played.Some, like Cnut, were believed to have cheated (in the account of Cnut’s game offered by Icelandic historian and poet Sturluson, the king made a poor move and then demanded to replay it, in what would be considered cheating under modern “touch-move” rules).AdvertisementOthers were simply poor losers. William the Conqueror, who became the first Norman king of England in the 11th century, was said to have broken a chess board over the prince of France’s head after a loss.The Cold WarDespite the risk of violence at the hands of a royal, chess enjoyed continued popularity among the elites of Europe. Napoleon Bonaparte was one well-known player, even in exile.The rules were standardized over the centuries — and with that, more opportunities for cheating arose.One of the most notorious examples of chess-based trickery was that of the “Mechanical Turk,” a late 17th-century contraption that claimed to be an automated chess player. In fact, a human player was hiding inside. Somehow, both Napoleon and Benjamin Franklin were reported to have been taken in by the ruse.AdvertisementAs chess tournaments proliferated, another tactic became common: collusion, whereby players would withdraw or deliberately lose to help others progress.The issue gained attention after the creation of the International Chess Federation, known by its French acronym FIDE, and the increasingly high-stakes spectacle of the World Chess Championship, which became the site of Cold War chess battles — and accusations of cheating.In a 1962 Sports Illustrated article, U.S. prodigy Bobby Fischer accused Soviet players of deliberately drawing their games to preserve their energy for games against him. Four decades later, the former head of the Soviet team that year admitted the allegations were true.Fischer would go on to win the 1972 World Chess Championship, beating the Soviet player Boris Spassky.The U.S. victory was short-lived: Fischer would refuse to defend his title in 1975 and entered a long period of decline. In 1992, he won an unofficial rematch against Spassky but ended up facing an arrest warrant for breaking U.N. sanctions on Yugoslavia, where the match was held.Modern methodsThe end of the Cold War might have temporarily cooled the geopolitics of chess. But changes to technology soon meant there were far more opportunities for foul play.AdvertisementIn the 1993 World Open in New York, an unrated player who was able to force a draw against a grandmaster was accused of using technology to cheat. The player reportedly wore headphones, had a pulsing bulge in his pocket and appeared to not fully understand the basic rules of chess.Since then, the risk of technological cheating has affected chess at all levels. Three top French players were suspended for allegedly cheating via coded text message in 2011. Four years later, a Georgian champion was found to have an iPhone hidden in a bathroom during the 17th annual Dubai Open Chess Tournament.In modern chess, even the best players are no match for chess programs that can run on a phone. Garry Kasparov, the legendary Russian player, was able to beat IBM’s supercomputer Deep Blue in 1996, but he became the first world champion to lose a match to a computer the following year, when Deep Blue won a rematch.AdvertisementAs Nigel Short, an English chess grandmaster, put it to The Washington Post in 2015: “My microwave could beat Magnus Carlsen.”Aside from the frontier of cheating enabled by technological advances, politics has continued to contaminate chess. Critics say that FIDE is effectively controlled by Russia.From 1995 to 2018, it was led by Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, a former president of the Russian Republic of Kalmykia, whom the United States placed under sanctions in 2015 for supporting financially the Assad regime in Syria. Arkady Dvorkovich, a former Russian deputy prime minister, succeeded Ilyumzhinov.Despite controversy over the war in Ukraine, Dvorkovich was reelected for a second term last month, beating Carlsen’s Danish coach, Peter Heine Nielsen, and Ukrainian grandmaster Andrii Baryshpolets.With a game so suffused with distrust at a fundamental level, perhaps Carlsen can’t be blamed for being suspicious.Niemann has offered to play the game naked to dispel his doubters. That, to be fair, is an offer with which King Cnut never had to contend.This report has been updated.",Adam Taylor,"In chess, a long history of cheating, chicanery and Cold War shenanigans"

13,"MEDAN, Indonesia — It was his third soccer match.Muhammad Virdy Prayoga, 3, was just getting to know the game. He had watched his first match just a few months ago with his parents, and on Saturday, he entered Kanjuruhan stadium with more than 40,000 others streaming in to watch Indonesia’s second-largest derby. Arema FC, the home team for Indonesia’s eastern Malang regency, was facing off against Persebaya Surabaya, its rival from East Java.Are you on Telegram?

His mother, Elmiati, 33, turned on her phone to film a video and Virdy grinned widely at the camera, his eyes shining with excitement. He loved Arema FC; he loved watching the players far down on the pitch — and he loved being part of the crowd.Anger mounts toward police as Indonesia reels from stadium tragedyBut as chaos overcame Kanjuruhan stadium that night, culminating in what has become one of the deadliest sporting event disasters in the world, it was the crowd that took Virdy away from his mother.Advertisement“We didn’t know what was happening,” Elmiati said of the stampede. “People just kept pushing and shoving.”As fallout continues from the tragedy, arguably one of the most wrenching figures has been the number of children reported dead. Initially, officials said that there were 17, but on Wednesday, Wiyanto Wijoyo, the head of the Malang Health Authority, told The Washington Post that the number had more than doubled to 40. According to death certificates from local hospitals, he added, there were 131 fatalities in total.On Saturday, after the match, which Arema lost, a group of Arema supporters invaded the pitch and tried to approach players. Police and military personnel responded aggressively, using batons and riot shields to beat back supporters before firing dozens of rounds of nonlethal munitions including tear gas onto the pitch and directly into the stands. In the scramble to escape through the stadium’s narrow doors, some of which were locked, dozens of people suffocated or were trampled to death.Of the 101 people who were taken to Wava Husada Hospital on Saturday night and Sunday morning, 73 died, said Isabella Kusuma Anjelin, an emergency medicine specialist who was working at the time. Some were children, but few were as young as 3.AdvertisementElmiati, who, like many Indonesians, goes by one name, was watching the game from section 13 of the stands. When the match ended, she, her husband and their son were still in a good mood, although Arema had lost. They wanted to get home to their other daughter, 14, who had stayed home.She started to feel alarmed when she saw police charging onto the field. And when they started firing tear gas directly at the stands, near where she was seated, she started to panic.“The gas burned my throat, and it was stinging my eyes and skin,” she said. “They just kept firing and firing.”Desperate for the family to escape the thick cloud of tear gas, her husband, Rudi Hariyanto, 34, picked up Virdy as they tried to leave via gate 13. It was obstructed, allowing only one person at a time to pass through, Elmiati remembered. As people around her pushed to escape, she became separated from her husband and son.AdvertisementAfter getting outside, Elmiati learned from another family member who had also been at the game that Hariyanto and Virdy were still inside. She gave a photo of them to local authorities to see if they could help to identify them. Just after 11 p.m., about an hour after police first started firing tear gas, she got a call.Virdy was at Kanjuruhan Hospital, and Hariyanto was at Wava Husada hospital. Both had died.At Kanjuruhan Hospital, Elmiati held Virdy’s body, stroking his hair. His head had been bandaged and dried blood streaked from his nose. His face was pale and his eyes closed.“We were planning to send him to kindergarten next year,” Elmiati said. “Now he’ll never get the chance.”Malang police chief Ferli Hidayat was dismissed Tuesday over the disaster, along with nine commanders from the Mobile Brigade Corps, a paramilitary arm of the Indonesian National Police that was present at Kanjuruhan stadium during the clearing of supporters.

15,"SINGAPORE — At Love Handle, a deli that labels itself a butcher shop in downtown Singapore, there is no meat for sale. Instead, jackfruit pastrami is sliced into razor-thin strips, minced soy beef is drenched in teriyaki sauce and mushroom steaks are cut into filets.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightThe shop, whose black-and-white checkered interiors hold a butcher block, slicer and mincer, labels itself Asia’s first plant-based meat “butchery.” It caters to those who want to give up animal meat without sacrificing the comfort of a double cheeseburger and greasy nuggets.“Our inspiration was McDonald’s chicken nuggets,” said chef and co-founder Addis Tan, pointing to a steaming batch of breaded chicken substitutes. “We want customers to comfort eat food they can associate with memories or things their mom cooked.”Love Handle estimates that half of its customers are meat eaters experimenting with plant-based protein. The shop hopes to ease them into meat alternatives with products they can easily identify, such as substitutes for Italian herb meatballs and sausages.AdvertisementAlternative meats, which may include plant-derived products and animal meat grown from cells in labs, are becoming increasingly popular with consumers and investors. Market revenue is expected to roughly double, to $12.3 billion by 2029, according to market-research consultants Fortune Business Insights. However, some traditional-meat producers are skeptical that substitutes will continue to see rapid growth. They say alternatives fail to replicate the taste of animal meat and are likely to be eaten regularly only by a small group of consumers.In regions such as Southeast Asia that have fast-growing populations and are grappling with food export restrictions, substitutes for traditional meat are emerging as a reliable protein alternative. And it’s not just attracting vegetarians: The meat alternatives industry is becoming a darling of food security experts, venture capitalists and companies trying to protect themselves from supply chain crunches.The robots are here. And they are making you fries.Such alternatives often require less space, water, time and materials to make, according to researchers, making them more resilient to the supply chain shocks that have recently plagued the animal meat industry. In parts of the world, such as Northern Europe, some alternatives are becoming as cheap as traditional meat, a shift investors hope will reach more price-conscious consumers in less wealthy countries that are increasingly consuming meat.Advertisement“Soon having a meat steak will be a premium experience, a treat for a special occasion,” Tan said.Alternative meats, once considered a costly novelty, have become particularly attractive in the wake of avian flu outbreaks in Europe, pandemic lockdowns in China and the war in Ukraine, all of which battered the global supply of animal protein. In Asia, supplies were further restricted in May when Malaysia announced a ban — since loosened — on chicken exports and India placed curbs on wheat exports, a major ingredient in animal feeds.Global meat prices reached an all-time high in June, according to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization’s meat price index. (Prices have dropped slightly since but are still sharply up from a year ago.) The price of a dozen large eggs in U.S. cities also hit a record high of $3.11 in August.AdvertisementBy contrast, industry professionals say better technology and larger scale have allowed them to sell alternative meats at increasingly lower costs. In the Netherlands, meat substitutes became less expensive than animal protein in 2022, according to a study commissioned by a Dutch nonprofit organization that promotes meat alternatives. Some alternative egg products have also reached price parity with animal eggs.But on average, plant-based meat is two times as expensive as beef, and more than four times as expensive as chicken per pound, according to a 2021 report by the Good Food Institute nonprofit that cited Nielsen data.Some makers of meat substitutes in North America and Britain, such as Beyond Meat, have also struggled with higher costs and were unable to rapidly grow sales this year as inflation gives cost-conscious customers in key markets pause.For those who have long searched for meat substitutes, lower prices have been a game changer.Audrey Seah, 54, has been looking for alternative meats to create Southeast Asian dishes such as chicken rice and pulled beef rendang for her vegan husband. A few years ago, the products were too expensive for her budget and hard to find. Now, they have their own section in the frozen food aisle at her local supermarket.Advertisement“Prices have gone down, and in some supermarkets, you can now find alternatives at the same price as meats,” she said. Lower prices mean the Seah family eats more alternative proteins than ever.Investors are betting that these trends will continue, and as production of the alternatives increases and prices fall, new markets will open up. “We can’t compete with cheap chicken in Indonesia, but it is only a matter of scale,” said Michal Klar, a founding partner of Better Bite Ventures, a fund that invests in meat substitute start-ups in Asia. “It’s a Tesla model. You start high end, the scale is not quite there, but we are hoping that some countries can leapfrog the transition as people increase meat consumption.”Production of meat alternatives can also be more responsive to changes in demand, said Helga Angelina Tjahjadi, co-founder of Green Rebel, an Indonesian start-up that produces whole cuts of meat substitutes from mushroom fibers and soy. Scaling up production can be as easy as keeping a machine running longer or investing in larger equipment, she said. The company is also able to use the same machines to produce beef or chicken alternatives, allowing them to flip between products to cater to changing demand.The hype over plant-based foods overlooks a key ingredient: PlantsFor William Chen, developing an alternative to meat is a question of national security.AdvertisementThe food science professor at Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University has spent years developing a climate-resilient urban farming system, including a mushroom that he says can grow with no light and little water. Potential use cases include feeding a population through droughts, pandemics and even during a nuclear apocalypse.“You can literally grow them in your cupboard,” he said. “They are independent of all these conditions affecting us, like climate change or war.”Singapore, a small, densely populated country, imports some 90 percent of the food it needs to feed its 5.6 million people. With land scarce, most farming must be done vertically, in rooftop gardens and stacked greenhouses. The country hopes to use alternative proteins, including meat grown in labs and mushrooms bred in urban basements, to help grow 30 percent of its own food by 2030.AdvertisementThe Southeast Asian city-state is also courting companies looking to experiment with new ways of making food. In 2020, it became the first country in the world to allow cultivated meat to be sold to the public. Such meats are produced when cells extracted from living animals multiply in a lab and grow into an edible-size piece of meat.In June, food tech company Eat Just broke ground on a multimillion-dollar facility in Singapore, the largest cultivated meat production center in Asia, according to the company. The facility will have the capacity to produce tens of thousands of pounds of meat grown from animal cells.Eat Just also makes mungbean protein eggs, which require 98 percent less water and 80 percent less land to produce, the company said. This summer, it was able to match premium animal egg prices in many markets for the first time, offering its mungbean protein eggs for $3.99 a bottle, the equivalent of eight eggs.Advertisement“It’s not that we’re completely insulated from the global supply chain … but we are just less impacted than an egg company would be because we are not relying on a commodity that’s going up and down based on all these factors,” Eat Just founder Josh Tetrick said.“A conventional animal protein system is not built for the world of increasing climate risk,” said Tetrick. “It’s not built for a growing population or a world of water scarcity. It’s not built for a world that needs more food security.”But for some consumers, the trade-off remains too costly.“It’s trying too hard and charging too much,” said Clare Chua, a 31-year-old business developer, as she bit into a $17 double cheeseburger with a soy patty and plant-based cheddar slices at Love Handle. “If you want to go vegetarian, just eat vegetables.”",Marina Lopes,"Supply chain woes boost meat substitutes in Asia, and investors are biting"
16,"As the summer of 1989 approached, a 35-year-old official in southern Fujian province named Xi Jinping was scrambling to contain local offshoots of nationwide protests that would become the biggest crisis for the Chinese Communist Party since Mao Zedong’s rule.Students were calling for democratic freedoms. They wanted an end to official corruption and censorship of the press.Xi, the Ningde city chief, and other Fujian officials struggled to figure out what to do as some 100,000 people took to the streets over several months starting in April, fired up by reports of students occupying Beijing’s Tiananmen Square. Some piled into the railway station in Fujian’s provincial capital, bringing trains to a standstill. Fujian police arrested thousands, according to local official histories. But more kept coming.AdvertisementBy the time Xi emerged 23 years later in 2012 as China’s top leader, many thought he represented a party that had mellowed in its advancing years. Since 1989, the Chinese leadership had moved toward what outside observers saw as a more stable system of collective rule. To prevent Mao-style personality cults, senior leaders shared power and the head of state was confined to two five-year terms. Xi, they prophesied, would be a liberal reformer.These predictions proved badly misguided.Xi Jinping’s crackdown on everything is remaking Chinese societyRather, the party was seriously concerned about its survival. Under the lax leadership of Xi’s predecessor, Hu Jintao, rampant corruption, factionalism and mounting social discontent were undermining legitimacy. Xi was brought in to clean up the mess.Over the last decade, Xi has reversed political changes of the 1980s designed to prevent over-centralization of power. He has done away with presidential term limits, reasserted party control and elevated his personal status to a level unseen in at least 30 years, if not the Mao era.At a crucial party congress beginning Oct. 16, Xi is set to complete his elevation to uncontested paramount leader. “Xi Jinping is somebody who has spent years making the whole ideological apparatus say that the party only works with him as leader, and only his way of thinking about things is accurate,” said Joseph Torigian, a China historian at American University in D.C.From early in his career, including in Fujian, Xi demonstrated a commitment to defending the party from perceived threats. After taking power, he launched a cleanup campaign that mirrored the party’s actions following Tiananmen, when it slammed the brakes on political change and rallied around a strongman leader, Deng Xiaoping, to steer the nation out of crisis.Now, it is increasingly unclear when Xi will consider his role as savior of the party completed. He speaks regularly of a world undergoing “changes unseen in a century” and warns of the grave dangers of relaxing political authority. Only with the party in command, Xi says, can China achieve its “great rejuvenation.”As crackdown eases, China’s Xinjiang faces long road to rehabilitationIt won’t be easy. As he begins his third term, he must contend with a severe economic slowdown and spiraling tensions with the United States and its allies. And many of the challenges Xi faces are related to his choices.Strict “zero covid” policies have hammered the economy. After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, his close partnership with Vladimir Putin has fueled concern in Western nations over Beijing’s intentions, following harsh security clampdowns in Hong Kong and Xinjiang. And China’s military aggression toward Taiwan is threatening to destabilize the region and bring tension with the United States to a head.AdvertisementBut early indications suggest Xi is preparing to ramp up, not tamp down, his policy ambitions after the meeting. In the last year, Xi has intensified policy initiatives to promote China’s vision of global development and security as well as an ambitious drive to deliver “common prosperity” by tackling inequality at home.Aside from being reappointed general secretary of the party and chairman of the party’s Central Military Commission (and therefore almost certainly staying on as president from early next year), analysts predict that Xi will probably achieve a “supermajority” of politicians within his network on the 25-member Politburo that sits at the apex of power. Pekingologists are watching to see if he receives a new official title such as “people’s leader” or “party chairman.” Few expect a successor to emerge at the twice-per-decade conclave.“Counterintuitively, the more problems that the system faces, the more of a case that Xi Jinping can make that it was right” for the party to give him broad decision-making powers and authority as the “core” of the leadership, Torigian said.China’s State Council Information Office and Foreign Ministry declined to answer questions for this article.Party manIn 2012, as Xi was preparing to be confirmed as China’s next top leader, the party was struck with one of the largest political earthquakes it had faced since 1989. Bo Xilai, a contemporary of Xi’s and contender for a top leadership position, fell from power in a scandal that revealed deep fractures and glaring abuses of authority in the senior ranks.As the Arab Spring was deploying social media and promises of democratic reforms to topple authoritarian regimes, official corruption was everywhere in China. And an angry public was increasingly calling it out online, posting pictures of cadres with Rolexes and fueling rule-of-law activism.AdvertisementAs a “princeling” son of a revolutionary leader with a record of loyalty, Xi was brought in to put the nation back on track. “There was a broad consensus that the party was at an existential turning point and that something needed to be done,” said Christopher Johnson, a former senior China analyst at the Central Intelligence Agency and CEO of China Strategies Group.After taking power, Xi immediately warned officials about the seriousness of the situation. In internal speeches, he said that tackling corruption was a question of survival for the party.In contrast to other authoritarian leaders including Mao, who occasionally ran roughshod over established institutions to grab power, Xi has largely worked within the party to strengthen its levers of power while placing himself in a unique position to operate them.One example is how he turned an anti-graft campaign designed to enforce discipline and punish excess after Bo’s downfall into an expanded and permanent National Supervisory Commission, established in 2018. “That’s why he is so powerful now. If he controls that institution, then he can compel consent from colleagues on policies and decisions of his preference with the threat of disciplinary investigation,” said Ling Li, a lecturer on Chinese politics and law at the University of Vienna, adding that the extent to which Xi has achieved complete personal control over the anticorruption apparatus is unclear.In January 2013, two months before he assumed the presidency, Xi advised against denigrating either Mao or Deng for fear that the People’s Republic could collapse like the Soviet Union. He oversaw a mass education campaign for cadres who watched a documentary about the Soviet regime’s final years. It warned of the need to be “vigilant in peacetime” and spoke of “bitter lessons” from Mikhail Gorbachev’s failure to prevent the party from unraveling.AdvertisementThe moral of the Soviet Union’s demise continues to animate Xi’s leadership today. In July, the docuseries was rereleased by the official social media account of World Socialism Studies, a research institute under the state-run Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.After Gorbachev’s death on Aug. 30, Chinese nationalists called him a “villain of history.” The propaganda department of Zhejiang province said that “he did indeed bear unavoidable responsibility” for the Union’s breakup.U.N. report: China may have committed crimes against humanity in XinjiangIn the name of preventing “separatism,” Xi imposed draconian national security legislation on Hong Kong to end protests over creeping interference from Beijing. He has pursued a policy of mass detention and forced assimilation in Xinjiang, which the U.N.'s human rights commissioner recently ruled may constitute crimes against humanity. He has declared that self-governing Taiwan “must and will” come under Chinese Communist Party rule.Xi’s dedication to the party is apparent in little-known essays and speeches reviewed by The Washington Post from his 17 years in Fujian — as is his tendency to respond to periods of uncertainty with more-concentrated control.AdvertisementOne lesson Xi took from Tiananmen was that art and literature could be a threat to the party, presaging the shift to stricter censorship under his rule. In October 1989, Xi wrote in local literary magazine “Caibei” that art could not be allowed to be used “as a political tool.” He criticized an avant-garde exhibition held in Beijing before the protests, where one artist had squatted over eggs like a chicken and another washed his feet in a bowl.Unmentioned by Xi was the most notorious part of the show: A 26-year-old art student had illegally fired a gun, as part of her performance art, after which she was immediately arrested. “It’s impossible for any nation’s government or ruling party to not meddle at all in literature and the arts,” Xi wrote. “The difference is only in the extent of the interventions. Standards vary.”At the same time as Xi led efforts to tamp down protests in Ningde, the party’s top leadership was creating a hard-line position against political liberalization that would persist until Xi and sharply intensify under his tenure.“Never Turn Back,” a recently published history of the 1980s in China by Harvard scholar Julian Gewirtz, shows that substantive debates about political reform, led by then general secretary Zhao Ziyang, took place throughout the decade, but hard-liners within the party swiftly ended them after Tiananmen.Propaganda directives from the time gathered by Gewirtz describe how the crisis awakened the party to the failure of ideological and political work during the 1980s. A report by state investigators noted a “loss of faith” in the party and socialism, prescribing targets for ideology and politics like those for the economy.AdvertisementTo reassert control after the purge of Zhao, Deng was designated as the “core” of the party, a title he conferred to his chosen successor, Jiang Zemin. In May 1989, Deng advised that leaders should “not be dissatisfied with each other, do not deplete your own power. … The key is the leadership core.”Xi has ruled by that same mantra. He was crowned “core” leader in 2016, a title that eluded his predecessor. An important resolution on party history passed in November secured Xi’s position as the unquestioned leader for the foreseeable future, when it ruled that establishing Xi Thought as guiding ideology and establishing Xi as core of the party “expressed the deepest wishes of the whole party, the whole military, and the peoples of the whole country.”Ideological focusWeeks after the Tiananmen crackdown, in July 1989, Xi hiked into the backcountry with a straw hat and walking stick, to visit the impoverished village of Xiadang. Xi had chosen the village, one of the most remote in Ningde, for the center of his poverty alleviation push.It was the carrot to the stick of a security buildup to tamp down political unrest, as recorded in local gazetteers. Even as Xi hiked the hills touting economic opportunity, the county where Xiadang was based had just built a munitions warehouse and started twice-a-year patriotic training for militias. Soon after, provincial authorities announced police may take anyone who did not produce their national ID card back to a police station.Xi would report incredibly rapid success: More than 96 percent of destitute people in his district pulled out of abject poverty in two years.AdvertisementXi has since brought a similar deal to China’s people on a larger scale. Poverty alleviation has been one of his hallmark campaigns, capped by his declaration in early 2021 that China had eradicated extreme poverty. As with his experiment in Xiadang, the nationwide poverty relief campaign came with parallel measures to quell political dissent, with some of the harshest execution reserved for ethnic minorities in Xinjiang.In Xiadang village today, the myth of Xi the man blends seamlessly into the nationwide initiatives he is credited with creating. Xi’s quotations sprawl across walls and buildings in large, red characters. Local museums show photos of Xi personally leading the charge, walking through fields with a hoe slung over his shoulder.Central to Xi’s mode of rule is renewed enforcement of the ideological “mass line” within the party — shorthand for following directions set by the top leadership. His eponymous philosophy, Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, is taught in schools and pored over by economic planners, People’s Liberation Army generals and diplomats.“Ideological control is not a supplement, but arguably the foundation of political control, because if an autocrat can control people’s ideas and beliefs, there would be no need for coercion,” said Yuen Yuen Ang, a professor of politics at the University of Michigan.The fear is that Xi has over-centralized power, making criticism of his policies tantamount to criticism of the party itself. Ang sees this dynamic at play with the sidelining and silencing of voices that criticized Xi’s “no limits” partnership with Russia — a move that escalated Western perceptions of China as a threat.Taming TaiwanIn 1995, the 42-year-old Xi found himself on the front lines of a different crisis. The United States had allowed Taiwan’s President Lee Teng-hui to visit, infuriating Beijing, which claimed Taiwan as a runaway province. The People’s Liberation Army mobilized troops in Fujian.Pelosi’s Taiwan visit ushers in new phase of China’s pressure campaignXi was head of Fujian’s capital Fuzhou, and also held a military title. While it’s unclear if he was directly involved in the barrages of missiles fired from Fujian into the waters around Taiwan that year, he must have keenly followed events. When Xi was promoted to governor, he ordered a buildup of military installations, citing Lee’s trip and the threat of Taiwan “separatism,” according to an essay he published in 2000.Since becoming president, Xi has expressed impatience on Taiwan, saying in 2019 “we should not allow this problem to be passed down from one generation to the next.” He has ramped up naval drills near Taiwan, raising alarms that he could be flirting with the idea of invasion.In August, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) visited Taiwan, plunging U.S.-China ties to fresh lows. China’s ambassador to France declared that Taiwan’s people would need to be reeducated after unification, in line with Xi’s broader push for ideological allegiance.Loyalty enforcing mechanisms have been strengthened from the top to bottom rungs of the party. Low-level members are encouraged to attend study sessions where they learn about ideology and pledge fealty. At the highest level, the members of the Politburo since 2018 have been required to present annual reports to Xi for his approval and feedback.AdvertisementXi first adopted a similar practice in April 1989 when he set up a “responsibility system” for Ningde officials, including himself. They would be assessed on progress toward self-set goals and be “severely punished” for inaction, according to a front-page article in the official Fujian Daily newspaper from the time.As students filled the streets in May 1989, Xi called a news conference in Fujian. He reminded local journalists of the chaos of the Cultural Revolution, and argued that restricting personal freedoms was necessary for society to function. The elision of freedom with lawlessness was an easy one to make, and one that Xi’s party still makes today.“If everyone just does what they want,” he said, “do you still have guarantees of your democracy and security? Can it really be done this way? So democracy cannot be absolute. It must have certain constraints.”Dou reported from Ningde, China.

17,"TOKYO — North Korea has ramped up its missile tests this year as it expands its weapons program, conducting 23 launches since January. In the past two weeks, it fired five rounds of missiles.But its test on Tuesday raised the stakes: It flew a missile over Japan for the first time since 2017. It didn’t warn Tokyo in advance. And that missile flew farther than anything previously launched by North Korea.Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine.ArrowRightMissile tests can serve many purposes, including improving technical capabilities and sending a political message, both domestically and globally. They also serve as a reminder of the lack of progress on jump-starting nuclear negotiations with the regime and how Pyongyang’s military capabilities have evolved during the stalemate.So what’s going on?Flying over JapanOn Tuesday, residents in northern Japan woke to sirens warning them of the missile launch. North Korea fired an intermediate-range ballistic missile at 7:22 a.m. Japan time, which flew 4,600 kilometers (2,858 miles) for 22 minutes over Japan’s Aomori prefecture before landing in the Pacific Ocean, Japanese officials said. It reached an altitude of 1,000 kilometers (621 miles).AdvertisementIt’s not clear what type of weapon it was. Japanese Defense Ministry officials say it may be similar to the Hwasong-12, which can reach Japan and Guam, a U.S. territory in the Pacific Ocean. The missile may be an upgrade from the Hwasong-12, given its trajectory and the distance it traveled, according to Kim Dong-yup, a former South Korea Navy officer who teaches at Kyungnam University in Seoul.Why has North Korea stopped boasting about its missile tests?North Korea has been aggressively testing its weapons in line with leader Kim Jong Un’s five-year plan. Earlier this year, Kim said he would “strengthen and develop” his country’s nuclear and weapons program at the “highest possible” speed.North Korea typically lofts missiles high in space, which then land in the waters in between the country and Japan to avoid threatening the security of its neighbors. Launching one across Japan may have been intended to make a political point, some experts say.Why now? Why Japan?We don’t exactly know what that point may be; North Korea is one of the most closed-off countries in the world, and it hasn’t publicly talked about its missile launches in six months. But there are clues that can help experts understand what message it may be trying to send.AdvertisementFor the past two months, the U.S., South Korean and Japanese militaries have been conducting military exercises designed to demonstrate their readiness to work together in the event of a conflict. While the allies say the drills are defensive in nature, Kim’s regime has long viewed them as hostile acts and used them to justify its weapons development and nuclear program.After Tuesday’s test, the U.S., South Korean and Japanese militaries launched air, sea and land drills in response.The United States and South Korea held live-fire drills on Oct. 5 after North Korea fired a ballistic missile over Japan for the first time in five years. (Video: Reuters)Security dynamics in Northeast Asia have become increasingly volatile with China’s growing military threats and in the aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Since the invasion, North Korea has drawn closer to Russia, while Japan’s relations with Russia have deteriorated.South Korea, U.S. begin military drills likely to draw North’s ireAs U.S.-China competition intensifies, China has drawn North Korea closer. South Korea and North Korea have grown further apart, with a new conservative government in Seoul eager to side with Washington to take a harder line toward Pyongyang.AdvertisementGiven this backdrop, North Korea may see an opportunity to exploit the instabilities in the region and remind a world focused on Russia’s war in Ukraine that it still matters, said Robert Ward, senior fellow for Japanese Security Studies at the International Institute for Strategic Studies.China, Russia draw North Korea closer than ever“The missile launch intensifies the security threat along Japan’s western flank — Russia to the north, North Korea in the center and China to the south. One important strategic threat to watch for is cooperation between Russia-China-North Korea, which amplifies the risk to Japan,” Ward said.From the North Korean perspective, there are not many flight-path options for a missile with a range exceeding 4,000 kilometers other than the route over northern Japan and toward the Pacific Ocean, said Masashi Murano, a Japan chair fellow at the Hudson Institute in Washington. The other options would be seen as an effort to strike the U.S. mainland or to reach Guam.Pending nuclear testA familiar cycle of escalation appears to be taking shape.AdvertisementTo some analysts, Tuesday’s test was reminiscent of the ramped-up tensions and rapid diplomacy that began five years ago. In August 2017, North Korea launched a ballistic missile over Japan amid threats from President Donald Trump that he would unleash “fire and fury” if Pyongyang kept ratcheting up tensions with repeated missile tests. In September 2017, North Korea conducted a nuclear test.What does North Korea’s new monster ballistic missile test mean?Again, North Korea is probably gearing up for its first nuclear test since 2017. According to commercial satellite images and statements from intelligence officials, North Korea apparently completed preparations for its seventh nuclear test and is waiting for the right political moment to hit the button.The United States and its allies intend to seek an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council to discuss the North’s latest provocation. But China and Russia, two of the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, have sided with North Korea since Pyongyang started its volley of ballistic missile tests in violation of the council’s resolutions banning them.AdvertisementMeanwhile, diplomatic relations between the United States and North Korea have hit a wall.Since denuclearization talks collapsed at the 2019 summit between Trump and Kim, U.S. and South Korean negotiators have urged North Korea to return to negotiations, saying they have no preconditions to resume dialogue. But the Biden administration has not shown it is willing to grant the sanctions relief that Kim seeks.",Michelle Ye Hee Lee,North Korea is turning up the heat again. Here’s why.
18,"Russian President Vladimir Putin is betting that an impending infusion of drafted troops can change the dynamic on the battlefield in Ukraine, but analysts say he is losing time, as his military operation succumbs further to Ukrainian advances and shows signs that it needs more than just raw personnel to regain the initiative.Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine.ArrowRightPutin has distracted attention from the bleak battlefield picture in recent days by orchestrating referendums, declaring annexations and making nuclear threats — all part of an attempt to freeze Russian territorial gains amassed since February that are unraveling by the day.But those political machinations in Moscow, carried out with great fanfare and bluster, have been unable to mask the reality some 600 miles away in Ukraine: Russia’s force is beleaguered and poorly managed — and in the immediate future, there may not be a silver bullet to fix it.AdvertisementMilitary analysts agree that Russia’s haphazard mobilization of at least 300,000 reservists is unlikely to help Putin on the battlefield in a matter of days. Whether it can aid Moscow in stabilizing the situation longer term — into the late fall, winter and spring — is an open question, they said.Searching for bodies with the Ukrainian captain collecting Russian corpsesThe impact of the new soldiers depends partly on whether they can be trained effectively — and how the Russian military organizes and deploys them.“People are not beans. Units are not units, except on a map,” said Frederick Kagan, a senior fellow and director of the critical-threats project at the American Enterprise Institute. “If you take a bunch of pissed-off, demoralized, scared, untrained humans, give them weapons and throw them into a fighting force, you don’t have soldiers.”Putin will have to focus first on restoring basic fighting capability to a military with badly depleted units that need to be reequipped at scale, which is difficult, Kagan said. “Before we are talking about flooding the zone, we are really talking about restoring combat units to anything like combat capability,” he said.AdvertisementHow much territory the Russians lose before the reinforcements arrive isn’t entirely down to Moscow. Ukraine has been beating back the Russians on two major fronts for more than a month. It is unclear how long Ukrainian forces, which are suffering losses of their own, can sustain the push.“One of the hardest things to know is when to stop,” said Christopher Doherty, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security. “Just as you’ve made this huge gain, you’ve stretched all of your logistical line, many people have been in combat for days on end. There is a psychological bump you get from winning and being on the offensive, but everybody runs out of juice at some point.”At the moment, Ukraine is keeping up its momentum. In the east, its forces wrested back the city of Lyman over the weekend and are advancing into the occupied Luhansk region. The Ukrainian counteroffensive in the south, meanwhile, has quickened in recent days, with forces moving down the Dnieper River toward Kherson.AdvertisementWhere and when the Ukrainian counteroffensive ultimately pauses will also depend on weaponry and ammunition, much of it coming from the United States.On Tuesday, the Biden administration announced an additional $625 million in aid to Ukraine, including four more HIMARS rocket launchers, 16 155-mm Howitzers and 75,000 155-mm artillery rounds. Ukraine has asked for longer-range rockets and tanks but so far hasn’t received them. The United States has committed more than $16.8 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since the start of the Russian invasion on Feb. 24, according to the White House.Russia regularly warns of consequences if the United States and its allies continue to arm Ukraine but has proved unable to disrupt the flow of weaponry. The Russian Foreign Ministry said Tuesday that the amount of American arms being given to Kyiv had reached a “dangerous line.”AdvertisementDisappointment about Moscow’s battlefield position has seeped into the public sphere in Russia, primarily through Telegram channels but also at times on tightly controlled state television.Russian military blogger Maxim Fomin, who posts under the pseudonym Vladlen Tatarsky, said in a video uploaded Tuesday to Telegram that the situation on the front for Russian forces is “not great, to put it mildly.”Russia doesn’t have enough forces on the battlefield “to solve the Ukrainian question decisively,” he said, expressing concern that draftees about to be sent to the front in many cases are not receiving proper training.“You can fight with unprepared people, but it’s fraught with big losses,” he said.Andrei Marochko, a Russia-backed militia official in Luhansk, told the Russian state television show “60 Minutes” that the Ukrainians backed by NATO were operating with superior battlefield intelligence capabilities.Advertisement“They literally look in real time online with satellites at our movements, our fortification structures,” Marochko said. “That gives them certain privileges and makes their chances of success a lot higher than ours.”He said the Russian side had fewer forces than the Ukrainians in a number of locations, offering up a rationale for Putin’s recent mobilization.Rapid loss of territory in Ukraine reveals spent Russian militaryThere are few indications that any of the major problems that have been dogging the Russian military since the start of the invasion have been solved. For months, it has faced difficulty carrying out combined ground and air attacks, leading troops with a variable will to fight and organizing a complicated logistics pipeline to get supplies to the front.More than seven months in, no clear commander of the Russian campaign has emerged in public, and recent reports have suggested that Putin is intervening personally to make battlefield decisions. Hard-liners within Russia have attacked the country’s generals publicly for poor decision-making.AdvertisementThe problems Putin is facing in Ukraine are compounded by risks at home. The mobilization has made the war in Ukraine real for many Russians who had been paying little attention.The result is likely to be many more Russians — including those with sons, brothers and husbands now headed to the front — searching out information about how Russian forces are faring.“They have given people a reason to pay attention to what is happening on the battlefield,” said Sam Greene, a professor of Russian politics at King’s College London. “When you are not being sent there, you can just kind of get news off the television, and the television isn’t going to tell you much. Now all of a sudden it matters to you.”At the same time, the Russian state has fumbled in its execution of the draft, calling up men meant to be disqualified.AdvertisementRussia restructured its military 10 years ago and dismantled a lot of the mobilization system, which was expensive to maintain and seen as largely unnecessary — and now it is showing, said Dara Massicot, a senior policy researcher at the Rand Corp.Massicot said there is little reliable public information about how Russia intends to train and deploy the draftees, making it too early to say exactly what kind of impact the mobilization is likely to have. She said the new troops are likely to have poor combat capability but could free up personnel in the rear to fight at the front, assuming there are soldiers to free up.“Creating a tank battalion out of these guys is going to go how we all would expect,” Massicot said. But if they are used in an auxiliary or noncombat role, she said, they could help Moscow hold on to territory.AdvertisementThe situation has demonstrated the limits of Putin’s ability to control the functions of his own government and military.“One of the things that we should have learned through this is that there are things that Putin doesn’t know — one of which is how good is his army, how effective is his state,” Greene said. “He has never tried this stuff before. So, he is not going to know how effectively it’s going to work until push comes to shove.”",Paul Sonne,Putin faces limits of his military power as Ukraine recaptures land

Ukrainian forces accelerated their advances on territories occupied by Russian troops and their separatist proxies, liberating towns in the southern Kherson region while also moving toward Luhansk in the east. After taking back Russian-controlled areas in the northeast Kharkiv region in a lightning campaign last month, Ukraine is hoping to remove Russia’s last footholds north and west of the Dnieper River, which will cripple the Kremlin’s already-waning ability to mount its own campaign on the strategic Ukrainian port of Odesa.“The Ukrainian armed forces commanders in the south and east are throwing problems at the Russian chain of command faster than the Russians can effectively respond,” said a Western official who briefed my colleagues about sensitive security information on the condition of anonymity. “And this is compounding the existing dysfunction within the Russian invasion force.”AdvertisementMorale and unit cohesion among the Russian brigades on the front are in tatters, with Ukrainian strikes on Russian ammunition and supply depots exacting a critical toll.

Some estimates found that 700,000 people — about 1 out of every 200 Russians — left the country in the space of less than two weeks since President Vladimir Putin ordered a “partial mobilization” of troops to reinforce his faltering invasion.The current state of play follows the Ukrainian recapture over the weekend of the city of Lyman, a key transit hub in eastern Donetsk. My colleagues journeyed there and spoke to locals as gunfire echoed in the distance. “Well, they’re either hunting pheasants, rabbits or Russians,” a retired schoolteacher quipped to them.Refuting annexation, Ukrainian forces push on from Lyman toward LuhanskPutin is trying to create his own facts on the ground. By Tuesday, motions had passed through Russia’s rubber-stamp parliament accepting the “accession treaties” Putin signed last week announcing the absorption of the Ukrainian regions of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia — all only partially occupied by Russian troops — into the Russian Federation. Russian-backed separatists in these four so-called republics had staged sham referendums to join Russia, outraging Kyiv and the international community.AdvertisementThe annexations only heighten the awkwardness for Kremlin officials, who as of yet could not detail where their borders lay as Ukrainian forces pushed through wilting Russian defenses.“Ukraine’s victory in Lyman will remain symbolic for the message it sent to the Kremlin: Putin’s annexation of the partly occupied regions was a farce,” my colleagues reported from the front lines. “Lyman was very much part of the lands that Putin claimed in a ceremony in Moscow on Friday, but just one day later, his soldiers left in a hurry — some dying on the way out.”Putin, of course, seems undeterred. His 37-minute speech Friday waved away criticism of Russia’s violations of international law and reprised his conspiratorial raging at the agendas of the United States and its European allies. He called for “a liberation anti-colonial movement against unipolar hegemony,” casting the annexations as an act of resistance to the “parasitic,” “neocolonial system” of the West, while also detailing the historical legacies of “plunder” and “genocide” carried out by various Western powers in centuries past.Today I spoke with President Zelenskyy to underscore that the U.S. will never recognize Russia’s purported annexation of Ukrainian territory.I reaffirmed my commitment to continue supporting Ukraine, including through today's new $625 million security assistance package. pic.twitter.com/0ZP2uopn4n— President Biden (@POTUS) October 4, 2022

As war fails, Russia’s authoritarian grandmaster backs himself into a cornerOn one hand, none of this rhetoric should be surprising. Such grousing is standard for Putin, who always seeks to place Russia on equal footing with the United States and its partners. Moreover, dogmatic “anti-imperialism” was stock-in-trade under the Soviet Union, which for decades sought to back and mobilize revolutionaries and leftists across the colonized or decolonizing world. In some instances, such as its support of opposition to the apartheid regime in South Africa, the Kremlin found itself on the right side of history far sooner than its adversaries in the West.AdvertisementBut all of this is ephemeral when set against the war unleashed by Putin, the documented atrocities conducted by his troops in Ukraine, and the overarching colonial project of using brute force to bring Ukrainians to heel while denying their nation-state’s very right to exist. “Putin is apparently oblivious to the absurdity of condemning imperialism while at the same time committing the most brazen act of imperial aggression in modern European history,” noted Peter Dickinson of the Atlantic Council.Putin is also silent about his own nation’s ruthless, bloody history of imperial conquest, let alone the horrors of Stalinism. While Western empires were setting up their systems of exploitation and extraction in various parts of the world, Russia’s czars were waging merciless wars of expansion in places not far from the current battles in Ukraine.“In 1818, when Russian forces attempted to conquer the Northern Caucasus, they encountered a population that refused to be subdued,” wrote Lynne Hartnett, a historian of Russia at Villanova University. “In answer to the guerrilla warfare that the indigenous population unleashed against the invaders, Russia burned villages to the ground, incinerated forests and took civilians as hostages.”Advertisement“There’s no attempt to deal with the oppressions of the Russian and Soviet past, the way the Kremlin repeatedly colonizes, ethnically cleanses, deports, starves and mass murders other nations, and the way it kills and arrests and humiliates masses of its own people too in labor camps, gulags, and the killing cellars of the KGB,” wrote Soviet-born British journalist Peter Pomerantsev, nodding to how Putin last year shuttered Memorial, a major Russian civil society organization that investigated the misdeeds of the Soviet past.Instead, Putin is on his own revanchist journey of restoring Russia’s empire. “He is ‘gathering in the lands’ as did his personal icons — the great Russian tsars — and overturning the legacy of Lenin, the Bolsheviks, and The Post-Cold War settlement,” wrote Fiona Hill and Angela Stent in the latest issue of Foreign Affairs. “In this way, Putin wants Russia to be the one exception to the inexorable rise and fall of imperial states.”For now — as his citizens seek to flee, his nation’s geopolitical isolation deepens and his military teeters — Putin’s mission seems more delusional than ever.",Ishaan Tharoor,Annexations show the depth of Putin’s imperial delusion
20,"Iran’s bold and bracing protests, stretching across an unsettled nation for more than two weeks, have been marked by defiant acts and daring slogans that challenge the country’s clerical leadership and its stifling restrictions on all aspects of social life.Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine.ArrowRightGovernment security forces have responded with deadly, uncompromising force. At least 52 people have been killed, according to Amnesty International, including women and children.The ongoing protests began in response to the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman who fell into a coma after being detained by the country’s hated “morality police.”In videos that began circulating online Oct. 2, armed police and protesters are seen running near Sharif University while explosions can be heard. (Video: Reuters)Anger against Iran’s ‘morality police’ erupts after death of Mahsa AminiIran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, claimed Monday that the unrest had been instigated by foreign powers and blamed protesters for the violence: “The ones who attack the police are leaving Iranian citizens defenseless against thugs, robbers and extortionists,” he said.AdvertisementKhamenei gave his full backing to the security forces, signaling a further wave of repression could be coming.To understand the extent of the government’s crackdown against protesters, The Washington Post analyzed hundreds of videos and photographs of protests, spoke to human rights activists, interviewed protesters and reviewed data collected by internet monitoring groups. The Post geolocated videos of protests in at least 22 cities — from the Kurdistan region, where the protests began, to Bandar Abbas, a port city on the Persian Gulf, to Rasht on the Caspian coast.The investigation focused on three key tactics used by the government to crush the protests — the apparent use of live ammunition by security forces, targeted arrests and the throttling of internet service.The Post interviewed protesters in Marivan, Balo and Tehran, who corroborated the findings. All spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals by security forces.AdvertisementThe protester in Marivan, a city of 50,000 people in the Kurdish west, described the scene on Saturday as akin to martial law. “All of the security forces were out. … I would say more than 1,000. They filled every square and intersection and major street.”Indiscriminate forceThe Post geolocated videos from seven cities that appear to show security forces shooting at protesters. Though it was impossible to verify the type of rounds used from the videos alone, “it’s extremely likely [security forces] were using live rounds against protesters during the events of recent days and weeks,” said N.R. Jenzen-Jones, the director of Armament Research Services, who reviewed the videos for The Post.Videos show Iran’s violent crackdown as protests intensifySecurity forces have been firing indiscriminately at demonstrators since the start of the protests, 1500 Tasvir, an anti-government monitoring group, told The Post. Videos recorded Sept. 17, according to 1500 Tasvir, in the Kurdish city of Saqqez — Amini’s hometown — appear to corroborate the claim. They show protesters marching through the center of the city on the same day as Amini’s funeral. They are quickly dispersed by officers on motorcycles firing in the direction of the crowd.A video posted on Sept. 17 shows an injured protester in Saqqez, Iran, being rushed to a medical facility. (Video: Twitter)A video filmed on side streets nearby captures a frantic group carrying a young man, unconscious and covered in blood, into a medical facility.AdvertisementAnalysts with Janes, a defense intelligence provider, also reviewed videos for The Post and determined that at least two videos likely showed the use of live ammunition.Videos posted online Sept. 20 in Rasht and Sept. 23 in Tehran show officers firing at crowds, using what are likely live rounds, according to analysts. (Video: 1500 Tasvir; Telegram)In a video posted Sept. 20, officers fire pistols in the air and at retreating crowds in the northern city of Rasht. The officer to the left is likely firing off live rounds into the air where there is no point of impact, according to Andrew Galer, head of land platforms and weapons at Janes.A video posted Sept. 23 in Tehran shows a man in army fatigues calmly taking aim and shooting a variant of an AK-47 assault rifle, according to Janes. While blank cartridges are made for the AK-47, Janes said, it has no record of any less-lethal or riot-control rounds being made for the gun. “On probability, [these] are assessed as being live rounds,” Galer concluded.AdvertisementA leaked document from the general headquarters of Iran’s armed forces on Sept. 21 — obtained by Amnesty International and reviewed by The Post — ordered security forces to “severely confront” protesters. Another document, issued two days later by the commander of armed forces in Mazandaran province, went even further, ordering security forces to “confront mercilessly, and while going as far as causing deaths, any unrest by rioters and anti-Revolutionaries.”The protesters interviewed by The Post in the western cities of Marivan and Balo told The Post they had witnessed security forces firing on demonstrators.“Security forces fired directly at the people in Darai Square,” said the protester in Marivan, describing a crackdown on Oct. 1. “They had no intention to arrest or to calm the situation. They only wanted to shoot.”AdvertisementThe protester from Balo described a chilling “ambush” on Sept. 21 by the Basij, a paramilitary force under the command of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps. “Members of the Basij were already on the roofs of nearby buildings,” the protester said. “They started shooting in the air, and the crowd scattered.” Other Basij fighters came out onto the streets, shooting into the air at first, and then directly at the fleeing protesters, he told The Post.Two young men were killed in the barrage of bullets, he said — one was shot in the stomach, another in the throat. Their deaths were corroborated by Hengaw, a Kurdish rights group, and videos from their funerals were shared with The Post.ArrestsThe Post verified and geolocated five videos showing security forces violently arresting protesters in five cities across Iran over the past two weeks. The videos show security forces often detaining protesters away from the crowds, on side streets. Some arresting officers traveled on motorbikes, allowing them to quickly descend on demonstrators and whisk them away.AdvertisementThe protester in Balo recounted members of the Basij making arrests in the middle of the night on Sept. 21 and using tear gas to force civilians out of their homes.“They [the Basij] come with civilian clothes and cover their faces. It creates fear,” the protester said.As of Sept. 30, security forces had arrested at least 50 people in Balo, and the majority are still in custody, according to the protester. “There are no more protests in Balo because of the fear they created,” the protester said. “After 10 p.m., you don’t see anybody out.”Prisoners in Iran are routinely subjected to torture and other inhumane treatment, rights groups have found, and families often struggle to get information about loved ones who have been detained. “The documented acts of torture and other ill-treatment raise concerns that hundreds of people arrested since the start of the protests risk similar treatment in custody,” Amnesty said.Videos shared by anti-government monitoring group 1500 Tasvir and verified by The Post show violent arrests of protesters in cities across Iran. (Video: 1500 Tasvir)In a video from Gorgan, the capital of Golestan province in the northeast, officers on motorcycles surround and beat a protester in front of a closed storefront at night before arresting him.AdvertisementIn Tehran, a video shows officers walking a man in a black shirt, his hands behind his back, to a busy downtown street. They then force him onto the back of a motorcycle driven by an officer.In another video from Kermanshah, in the west, a protester surrounded by officers on motorcycles is placed into a police vehicle and driven away.Internet restrictionsIran has frequently employed internet disruptions during times of unrest, making it more difficult for protesters to communicate with one another and with the outside world. But the cuts over the past two weeks have been more targeted and appear to show a greater level of sophistication.Network traffic data from Iran to Google’s web search product shows significant disruptions in the evenings beginning Sept. 21, the bloodiest night of protests so far and a crucial turning point in the government’s response, according to Raha Bahreini, Amnesty’s Iran researcher. The majority of the deaths recorded by Amnesty took place Sept. 21.AdvertisementAccording to The Post’s analysis of internet data, traffic patterns show a cyclical nature to the disruptions, beginning every afternoon around 4 p.m. local time — the end of the Iranian workday, when most protests begin — and returning to normal levels after midnight.Instagram and WhatsApp, major platforms for sharing video, were also shut down Sept. 21, according to NetBlocks, a London-based group that monitors global internet access. These restrictions have coincided with sudden decreases in visual evidence coming out of Iran.The Post tracked the number of protest videos coming from a Telegram account that regularly posts and circulates clips. The count revealed the direct impact of the throttling of internet connectivity, with the number dropping from around 80 new clips on Sept. 21 to just 40 the day after.1500 Tasvir told The Post that in the first few days of the protests, the group received more than 3,000 videos per day. After the increase in internet disruptions, that number dropped dramatically, to about 100 to 200 videos per day.The protesters who spoke to The Post confirmed the internet restrictions observed in the data.“Most of the people don’t have internet at home,” said the protester in Balo. “They only have internet on their sim card, and it’s cut between 4 and 10 p.m. And even when it comes back, it’s still very bad.”That account was echoed by the protester in Marivan: “The internet gets cut every day at 3 or 4 p.m. and doesn’t come back until around midnight or 1 a.m.,” the protester said. “None of the big apps like Instagram or WhatsApp or Telegram work.”As Iran protests persist, supreme leader blames foreigners for unrestDespite the violence by security forces — and the daily blackouts — protesters are still in the streets. To some, the crackdown has only made them more determined. The protester in Tehran recalled a scene from a recent protest, where he and his compatriots dragged trash cans into the street and set them on fire. As security forces approached on motorcycles, they began to chant:“We didn’t have our people killed in order to compromise.”Kareem Fahim in Istanbul contributed to this report.",Joyce Sohyun Lee,Tactics of repression: How Iran is trying to stop Mahsa Amini protests
21,"Yusuf al-Qaradawi, an influential Islamic cleric whose views reached across the Arab world on Qatar’s Al Jazeera network, backing the Arab Spring uprisings and denouncing al-Qaeda while facing condemnation from some leaders who saw him as a threat, died Sept. 26 in Qatar’s capital, Doha. He was 96.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightThousands of mourners attended Mr. Qaradawi’s funeral in Doha on Sept. 27, a day after his death was announced by his family and state-run media in Qatar, where Mr. Qaradawi had lived in exile for decades after leaving his native Egypt. No cause was given, but the cleric had been largely out of the public eye since falling ill with the coronavirus last year.Mr. Qaradawi’s ideology was largely a self-made amalgam of Islamic schools — some moderate-leaning and others backing violence as a necessary tool — giving him a reputation as an independent voice that could sway in various, and at times apparently contradictory, directions.AdvertisementAt the core of his beliefs was an adherence to the Muslim Brotherhood, a group forged during his boyhood in Egypt that held Islam as a foundation for government, education and other key aspects of civil life. That itself made him a hugely polarizing figure.The Brotherhood is seen as the enemy of many Western-allied regimes across the Muslim world, which made Mr. Qaradawi a pariah for leaders in places such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.In 2015, an Egyptian court sentenced Mr. Qaradawi in absentia to death. Two years later, Qatar faced a full-scale blockade by Egypt and several Persian Gulf neighbors, partly for providing haven for Mr. Qaradawi and others.The pressure and persecution only elevated his stature among many followers. He wrote more than 100 books, including some highly regarded volumes on Islamic jurisprudence, and helped lead a website, Islamonline.net, that offered what some called e-fatwas on politics and personal conundrums.AdvertisementBut his platform on Al Jazeera gave him the self-crafted title of “global mufti,” bringing him into hundreds of millions of homes. He delivered sermons, gave interviews and hosted a call-in show, “Shariah and Life,” that dispensed guidance on topics ranging from euthanasia by Muslims (not acceptable), women’s role in politics (fine as long as traditional Islamic codes are followed) and whether it’s permitted to sterilize cats (yes, if done humanely).Maverick cleric is a hit on Arab TVHis multimedia reach gave his bigger pronouncements resonance unmatched by nearly any other Islamic scholar. He denounced al-Qaeda and the 9/11 attacks, but also declared that suicide bombings by Palestinians against Israelis were “heroic martyrdom” and that retaliation against U.S.-led forces in Iraq was legitimate defense. In 2009, he described the Holocaust as part of “divine punishment” against Jews.In 2016, Mr. Qaradawi revised his fatwa on Palestinian suicide attacks, saying they were no longer permissible because Palestinians had other options to resist Israel.“He is regarded by many as a ‘moderate’ — a possible bridge between the West and Islam,” Tommaso Virgili, now a researcher on Islamic issues at the Berlin Social Science Center, wrote in 2018. “However, many of his tenets show very little ‘moderation.’”Mr. Qaradawi dismissed contentions that his views fed tensions in the region. He described Muslims as part of a “single nation” that is not at odds with the West, but is also compelled to fight back against perceived injustices.Advertisement“I was the first who condemned the crimes of Sept. 11, even before it was clear to many that al-Qaeda was behind the attacks,” he told Der Spiegel in 2005. “There is certainly a difference if violence is used in a blind terrorist act or if it is used in rebellion against a foreign occupying force.”The interviewer asked if Mr. Qaradawi felt the Muslim world is morally superior.“We condemn the excessive materialism of the West. We deplore the loss of solidarity and brotherliness, the decay of morals and the daily violations of human dignity,” he replied. “God has disappeared.”Religious educationYusuf al-Qaradawi was born on Sept. 9, 1926, in the Nile Delta village of Saft Turab, the only child in a farming family. When he was 2, his father died and he was sent to live with his uncle, who became impressed with the boy’s ability to memorize long passages of the Quran.AdvertisementMr. Qaradawi was enrolled in a religious school in Tanta, about 60 miles northwest of Cairo, to prepare for Cairo’s al-Azhar University, regarded as the center of Sunni Muslim scholarship.In Tanta, Mr. Qaradawi’s first encountered the ideas of the Muslim Brotherhood, which was fast becoming a political force in Egypt between the world wars. Mr. Qaradawi often recounted how he was spellbound by a lecture from the group’s founder, Hassan al-Banna.The Muslim Brotherhood soon faced crackdowns by authorities worried about its rise. In 1948, it became a hunted group after a follower assassinated Egypt’s prime minister, Mahmoud an-Nukrashi Pasha. Banna was then killed by suspected government loyalists.Mr. Qaradawi graduated from al-Azhar in 1953 and became active in Brotherhood affairs. He was arrested and jailed at least three times, during which he claimed he was tortured. In the early 1960s, he left Egypt for Qatar, where the ruling dynasty offered him sanctuary and a position as an Islamic scholar.AdvertisementIn Qatar, Mr. Qaradawi publicly renounced some of the more radical elements of the movement. He rejected the teachings of renowned Muslim Brotherhood firebrand Sayyid Qutb, whose support of armed struggle helped give the ideological underpinnings for al-Qaeda, Egypt’s Islamic Jihad and, later, some leaders of the Islamic State.The Arab Spring protests that began in 2010 seemed a capstone to his calls for political reforms across the Muslim world — although he was always careful not to encourage any dissent that would upset his patrons in Qatar.“Our manner of protesting should reflect sense and reason,” Mr. Qaradawi said in a sermon in Doha in 2012.He used Al Jazeera to rally behind groups that overthrew and killed Libyan dictator Col. Moammar Gaddafi in 2011, and urged on demonstrations against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who managed to maintain control with the help from allies Iran and Russia.AdvertisementIn Egypt, Mr. Qaradawi made a triumphant return after President Hosni Mubarak was overthrown by protests in early 2011. “Don’t let anyone steal this revolution from you,” he told crowds in Cairo’s Tahrir Square. “Those hypocrites who will put on a new face that suits them.”His prominence in Islamist circles rose even higher when presidential elections in 2012 brought Muslim Brotherhood stalwart Mohamed Morsi to power. But many Egyptian activists and secular reformists strongly opposed Morsi and his allies, including Mr. Qaradawi.Egypt's ousted strongman Hosni Mubarak dies at 91Egypt’s military ousted Morsi in 2013 and opened a relentless purge against the Brotherhood. Mr. Qaradawi and his seven children were declared terrorists. His daughter Ola al-Qaradawi and her husband were arrested in 2017.In 2017, in an essay published 100 days after his daughter’s arrest, Mr. Qaradawi offered words of encouragement and said Egypt was “punishing your father through you.”Advertisement“A day would feel like eternity,” he wrote. “These days of injustice will, if God wills it, become part of your past.” (She was released in late 2021, but her husband remains jailed.)In addition to Ola, Mr. Qaradawi is survived by his third wife, Aicha; three other daughters, Siham, Ilham and Asmaa; three sons, Mohamed, Abdel-Rahman and Osama; and 12 grandchildren. Many of his children studied at British or U.S. universities.Mr. Qaradawi spent his recent years working on a unified compilation of his books and representing various organizations, including the International Union of Muslim Scholars.In a 2004 interview, Mr. Qaradawi reflected on the power of television to give him a voice that few other could match. He was unabashed about seizing the chance.“There are some preachers who can shake the very pulpit but cannot write. I know some sheikhs like that,” he told Arab Media & Society in 2004. “Some people can write very well; but put them up in the pulpit and they stutter and stammer. They can’t perform. … I think Allah has granted to me something of both.”",Brian Murphy,"Yusuf al-Qaradawi, influential Islamic scholar, dies at 96"

23,"ZAPORIZHZHIA, Ukraine — Alone in his apartment in the Russian-occupied city of Enerhodar in southeastern Ukraine, nuclear plant security guard Serhiy Shvets looked out his kitchen window in late May and saw gunmen approaching on the street below. When his buzzer rang, he was sure he was about to die.Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine.ArrowRightShvets, a former soldier in Ukraine’s military who was loyal to Kyiv, knew the gunmen would either kill or abduct and torture him. He thought briefly about recording a farewell to his family, who had fled to safety abroad, but instead lit a cigarette and grabbed his gun.Six Russian soldiers broke down his door and opened fire, which he returned. Wounded in the hand, thigh, ear and stomach, Shvets began to lose consciousness. Before he did, he heard the commander of the group tell his men to cease fire and call an ambulance.AdvertisementShvets, who survived the shooting, is among workers from the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant recounting their fears of being abducted and tortured or killed by Russian forces occupying the facility and the city of Enerhodar. Ukrainian officials say the Russians have sought to intimidate the staff into keeping the plant running, through beatings and other abuse. but also to punish those who express support for Kyiv.On Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin declared that Russia was taking ownership of the plant. With his decree, he ordered the creation of a state company to manage the facility and said all workers now need Russian permission to work there.Ukraine’s state nuclear operator, Energoatom, said it considers Putin’s decree “worthless” and “absurd.” It said the plant would continue to be operated by Energoatom as part of the Ukrainian energy system.AdvertisementA GOOD LIFE BEFORE THE WARLife was good for employees of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant before the Russian invasion of Feb. 24. They were guaranteed a financially secure and stable life for their families.And even though Ukraine still bears the psychological scars of the world’s worst atomic accident at Chernobyl in 1986, the Zaporizhzhia plant — Europe’s largest nuclear facility with its six reactors — provided jobs for about 11,000 people, making Enerhodar with its prewar population of 53,000 one of the wealthiest cities in the region.But after Russia occupied the city early in the war, that once-comfortable life turned into a nightmare.The invaders overran the ZNPP, about 6 kilometers (nearly 4 miles) from Enerhodar, but kept the Ukrainian staff in place to run it. Both sides accused the other of shelling the plant, damaging power lines connecting it to the grid and raising international alarm for its safety. Ukrainian officials say the Russians used the plant as a shield as they shelled nearby towns.AdvertisementReports of intimidation of the staff and abductions began trickling out over the summer. Rafael Mariano Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N.’s atomic watchdog, told The Associated Press about reports of violence between the Russians and the Ukrainian staff.Grossi traveled to Kyiv on Wednesday and will be in Russia later to hold consultations on Moscow’s intention to take over the plant and to continue his push for a safety zone to be established around it, the IAEA said in a statement.About 4,000 ZNPP workers have fled. Those who stayed cited threats of kidnap and torture — underscored by the abduction Friday of plant director Ihor Murashov, who was seized and blindfolded by Russian forces on his way home from work.He was freed Monday after being forced to make false statements on camera, according to Petro Kotin, head of Energoatom. He told AP Murashov was released at the edge of Russian-controlled territory and walked about 15 kilometers (9 miles) to a Ukrainian-held area.Advertisement“I would say it was mental torture,” Kotin said of what Murashov suffered. “He had to say that all the shelling on the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant was made by Ukrainian forces and that he is a Ukrainian spy ... in contact with Ukrainian special forces.”Enerhodar’s exiled Mayor Dmytro Orlov, who spoke to Murashov after his release, said the plant official told him he had spent two days “in solitary confinement in the basement, with handcuffs and a bag on his head. His condition can hardly be called normal.”President Volodymyr Zelenskyy described Murashov’s abduction as “yet another manifestation of absolutely uncovered Russian terror.”‘TERRIBLE THINGS HAPPEN THERE’More than 1,000 people, including plant workers, were abducted from Enerhodar, although some have been released, Orlov estimated. He fled to Zaporizhzhia, the nearest city under Ukrainian control, after refusing to cooperate with the Russians. Kotin estimated that 100-200 of those abducted are still being held.AdvertisementOrlov said the first abduction was March 19, when Russians seized his deputy, Ivan Samoidiuk, whose whereabouts remain unknown. The abductions then accelerated, he said.“Mostly, they took people with a pro-Ukrainian position, who were actively involved in the resistance movement,” he said.Orlov alleged they were tortured at various locations in Enerhodar, including at the city’s police station, in basements elsewhere and even in the ZNPP itself.“Terrible things happen there,” he said. “People who managed to come out say there was torture with electric currents, beatings, rape, shootings. ... Some people didn’t survive.”Similar sites were seen by AP journalists in parts of the Kharkiv region abandoned by Russian troops after a Ukrainian counteroffensive. In the city of Izium, an AP investigation uncovered 10 separate torture sites.AdvertisementPlant worker Andriy Honcharuk died in a hospital on July 3 shortly after the Russians released him, beaten and unconscious, for refusing to follow their orders at the facility, Orlov said.Oleksii, a worker who said he was responsible for controlling the plant’s turbines and reactor compartment, fled Enerhodar in June when he learned Russian troops were looking for him. He asked not to be identified by his full name for fear of reprisal.“It was psychologically difficult,” Oleksii told the AP in Kyiv. “You go to the station and see the occupiers there. You come to your workplace already depressed.”Many plant employees “visited the basements” and were tortured there, he said.“Graves appeared in the forest that surrounds the city. That is, everyone understands that something horrible is happening,” he said. “They abduct people for their pro-Ukrainian position, or if they find any Telegram groups on their phone. This is enough for them to take a person away.”AdvertisementAnother employee who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of his safety said he was unafraid of working at the plant despite the shelling but decided to flee in September after colleagues were seized. He said Russians visited his home twice while he was away, and the possibility of torture was too much for him.The plant’s last reactor was shut down in September to guard against a disaster from constant shelling, which cut reliable external power supplies needed for cooling and other safety systems. Kotin said the company could restart two of the reactors in a matter of days to protect safety installations as winter approaches and temperatures drop.But the power plant sits in one of four regions that Russia declares it has annexed, making its future uncertain.Kotin on Tuesday renewed his call for a “demilitarized zone” around the plant, where two IAEA experts are based.Advertisement‘FREEDOM OR DEATH’For Serhiy Shvets, whose apartment was raided May 23, it was only a matter of time before the Russians came for him during the occupation of Enerhodar, he said. He had signed up to serve in Ukraine’s territorial defense forces shortly after the invasion and had sent his wife and other relatives abroad for safety.He said the Russian forces who shot him called the ambulance “so I could die in the hospital.”Doctors initially gave him a 5% chance of survival after he lost nearly two-thirds of his blood. But following several operations, he was well enough to leave Enerhodar in July and is living in Zaporizhzhia.Shvets, whose right hand is in a metal brace, quietly exhaled from pain as he moved it and said the only thing he regrets now is that he is too disabled to fight.“I’m a descendant from Zaporozhian Cossacks,” he said, referring to his ancestors who lived on the territory of Ukraine from the 15th to 18th centuries and defended it from invaders. “There was no such thing as surrender for them — just freedom or death.”He added: “Why would I want such a life if I don’t have my freedom?”___Yuras Karmanau in Tallinn, Estonia, contributed.___Follow AP’s coverate of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",Hanna Arhirova | AP,"Ukraine nuclear workers recount abuse, threats from Russians"
24,"STOCKHOLM — Three scientists were jointly awarded this year’s Nobel Prize in chemistry on Wednesday for developing a way of “snapping molecules together” that can be used to explore cells, map DNA and design drugs that can target diseases such as cancer more precisely.Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine.ArrowRightAmericans Carolyn R. Bertozzi and K. Barry Sharpless, and Danish scientist Morten Meldal were cited for their work on click chemistry and bioorthogonal reactions.“It’s all about snapping molecules together,” said Johan Aqvist, a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences that announced the winners at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm.Sharpless, 81, who previously won a Nobel Prize in 2001 and is now the fifth person to receive the award twice, first proposed the idea of connecting molecules using chemical “buckles” around the turn of the millennium, Aqvist said.Advertisement“The problem was to find good chemical buckles,” he said. “They have to react with each other easily and specifically.”Meldal, 68, based at the University of Copenhagen and Sharpless, who is affiliated with Scripps Research in California, independently found the first such candidates that would easily snap together with each other but not with other molecules, leading to applications in the manufacture of medicines and polymers.Bertozzi, 55, who is based at Stanford University “took click chemistry to a new level,” the Nobel panel said, by finding a way to make the process work inside living organisms without disrupting them.The goal is “doing chemistry inside human patients to make sure that drugs go to the right place and stay away from the wrong place,” she said, speaking by phone at a news conference following the announcement.AdvertisementThe award was a shock, she said. “I’m still not entirely positive that it’s real, but it’s getting realer by the minute.”Later, speaking to The Associated Press by Zoom, Bertozzi said one of the first people she called after being wakened by the call around 2 a.m. was her father, William Bertozzi, a retired physicist and night owl, who was still awake watching TV.“Dad, turn down the TV, I have something to tell you,” she said she told him. After she assured him nothing was wrong, he guessed the news. “You won it, didn’t you?”One of three daughters, Bertozzi said she was “fortunate because I grew up with parents that were very supportive, evangelical almost, about having their girls participate in the sciences.”Bertozzi, who is paid by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, which also supports The Associated Press’ Health and Science Department, said she was grateful for the energy and enthusiasm that a Nobel Prize win will inject into the field.AdvertisementMeldal said he received the call from the Nobel panel about half an hour before the public announcement. “They ... told me not to tell anyone,” he told the AP, adding that he just sat in his office, shaking a bit. “This is a huge honor.”Meldal started out as an engineer, “but I wanted to understand the world so I thought chemistry would give me the solutions.”Jon Lorsch, director of the U.S. National Institute of General Medical Sciences, which supports the work of Bertozzi and Sharpless, described click chemistry and bioorthagonal chemistry as “sort of like molecular Lego — you have a group on one molecule that specifically attaches to a group on another molecule,” like Lego clicking together.“That makes it possible to attach molecules in very specific pre-defined ways,” he said, and gives scientists a very precise tool to build complex new molecules that can be used for drugs, synthetic materials and other uses.AdvertisementHowever, the first iteration of click chemistry could not be used with living cells. “The original click chemistry used copper as a catalyst to join molecules,” Lorsch said. “But the trouble is that copper is toxic to most living systems at higher concentrations.”Bertozzi then devised a way to jumpstart the reactions without copper or other toxic solvents — broadening the applications of the molecular Lego to human and animal tissues.“Being able to work without dangerous solvents, opened many news doors — it enabled scientists to work on new types of reactions that actually take place within the human body,” said Angela Wilson, president of the American Chemical Society.For example, that has allowed scientists to attach dyes to cancer cells to track their movements and analyze how they differ from healthy tissue.AdvertisementWilson believes that the advances of this year’s Nobel laureates “will allow more individualized medicine in the future because we can really track things much better within the human body.”M.G. Finn, a chemist now at Georgia Tech who collaborated with Sharpless on his Nobel-winning work, said click chemistry’s use in biology and drug development was still “at its infancy,” with more exciting discoveries to come.Meldal agreed.Winning the Nobel is “very much an opportunity ... when you get this kind of award to argue for our young people to take chemistry as a discipline at the university,” he said at a news conference in Copenhagen. “Chemistry is the solution to many of our challenges.”Last year the prize was awarded to scientists Benjamin List and David W.C. MacMillan for finding an ingenious and environmentally cleaner way to build molecules that the Nobel panel said is “already benefiting humankind greatly.”AdvertisementA week of Nobel Prize announcements kicked off Monday with Swedish scientist Svante Paabo receiving the award in medicine for unlocking secrets of Neanderthal DNA that provided key insights into our immune system.Three scientists won the prize in physics Tuesday. Frenchman Alain Aspect, American John F. Clauser and Austrian Anton Zeilinger had shown that tiny particles can retain a connection with each other even when separated, a phenomenon known as quantum entanglement, that can be used for specialized computing and to encrypt information.The awards continue with literature on Thursday. The 2022 Nobel Peace Prize will be announced Friday and the economics award on Monday.The prizes carry a cash award of 10 million Swedish kronor (nearly $900,000) and will be handed out on Dec. 10.

25,"CAIRO — The U.S. envoy to Yemen on Wednesday blamed rebel Houthi leaders for the recent failure to extend the country’s cease-fire agreement, accusing them of making last-minute ‘maximalist demands’ that derailed constructive negotiations.Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine.ArrowRightYemen’s warring sides failed to reach an agreement to extend the nationwide truce Sunday, threatening to reignite the country’s bloody civil war after a six-month cessation in front-line fighting.During a news conference, U.S. Special Envoy to Yemen Tim Lenderking said the Houthis ‘hijacked’ the negotiations by suddenly demanding the salaries of their military and security personnel be paid before that of Yemeni civil servants. Lenderking did not provide any other reason for the failure of the negotiations.The U.N.-backed truce took effect in April, as the war entered its eighth year. The ruinous conflict began in 2014 when Iranian-backed Houthi forces seized the capital of Sanaa and much of northern Yemen, pushing the government into exile. In response, a Saudi Arabia-led coalition — which included the United Arab Emirates — intervened in 2015 to try to restore the internationally recognized government to power.AdvertisementFollowing the passing of the cease-fire deadline, small exchanges of fire were reported in the western governorate of Al Dhalea, while military reinforcements were deployed by both sides in the front-line cities of Marib and Taiz. The reports post-cease-fire could not be immediately confirmed by The Associated Press.A Houthi official told the AP on Sunday that the U.N.’s unwillingness to provide written guarantees for several of the group’s demands proved the major obstruction to negotiations. The demands included the payment of employee salaries and the opening of Sanaa airport and the Houthi-held port of Hodeidah, the official said, who spoke on the condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to brief the media.April’s truce had originally established the partial opening of the capital’s airport and the Red Sea port of Hodeida, as well as the lifting of the Houthi blockade on Taiz, the country’s third largest city. However, disagreements over the opening and control of Taiz’s key entry roads has meant the city has remained under a Houthi-imposed siege. Both sides have reported several violations of April’s cease-fire agreement.AdvertisementAnalysts say the Houthis’ withdrawal from cease-fire talks is a reflection of the Shia group’s belief that they had greater political leverage in recent cease-fire talks and were more willing to return to war.However, Farea Muslimi, an associate fellow at British think tank Chatham House specializing in Yemen, told The Associated Press it is still likely Houthi leaders will be forced back to the negotiation table.“In not backing down from their position, the Houthis face expanded military pressure from U.S. and Saudi allies, along with greater internal economic difficulties,” he said.The Houthi forces have deployed an increasingly effective arsenal of weapons against Saudi Arabia and other rivals in recent years, including cruise missiles and drones, akin to those manufactured by their major backer Iran. Many of these larger weapons types were displayed in a Houthi military parade in late September. The Saudi-led coalition remains the dominant aerial force and has launched thousands of airstrikes on Houthi positions since 2015, resulting in the deaths of thousands of civilians, rights groups say.AdvertisementHouthi forces are also responsible for civilian casualties. Officers from their military have previously admitted to The Associated Press of recruiting children into their ranks arguing that boys as young as 10 are considered men.Meanwhile, factional infighting within the anti-Houthi coalition has surfaced in the country’s southern provinces. In August, United Arab Emirates-supported militia groups seized vital southern oil and gas fields controlled by other forces fighting with the Saudi-led coalition. Clashes between them and other forces from within the alliance have killed dozens.On Tuesday, The U.N. joined scores of other non-governmental organizations and international aid groups calling for Yemen’s warring parties to extend the truce and “build on the gains achieved over the last six months.”AdvertisementThe conflict, which in recent years turned into a regional proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran, has killed in excess of 150,000 people, including over 14,500 civilians, according to The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project. The fighting has thrown Yemen into one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises, pushing it into deeper poverty and near famine.“Yemen needs not just a military cease-fire, but a truce with hunger,” said Muslimi.",Jack Jeffery | AP,US envoy blames Houthis for failure to extend cease-fire

Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency published video of Namazi boarding a Royal Oman air force jet in Tehran and later Omani state TV aired video of his arrival in Muscat.Namazi’s release is the first of an American by Iran since President Joe Biden took office, although his son, Siamak, 50, and several other Americans remain in Iranian custody. Baquer Namazi’s release on humanitarian grounds, which was brokered by the United Nations, comes as talks have stalled on reviving the tattered 2015 Iran nuclear deal with world powers.AdvertisementJared Genser, a Washington-based lawyer representing the Namazi family, shared a photo of Namazi on the plane in a suit and tie.“Today is a good day for the Namazi family, but the work is far from over,” Genser said in a statement. “We now need the United States and Iran to act expeditiously to reach an agreement that will finally bring all of the American hostages home.” In addition to Siamak Namazi, there are at least three other Americans still held by Iran.After a brief stop in Oman, Namazi will undergo a procedure at the local branch of the Cleveland Clinic in Abu Dhabi to clear a severe blockage to his left internal carotid artery, Genser said. That blockage put Namazi at high risk of a stroke.The Biden administration said it was pleased that Namazi had been allowed to leave Iran and his son had been given a temporary release from prison.Advertisement“We welcome reports that U.S. citizen Baquer Namazi has left Iran, and his son Siamak has been granted furlough from prison,” State Department deputy spokesman Vedant Patel said.He thanked “all of the countries and organizations that have helped our wrongfully detained citizens” but did not specifically mention Iran.Namazi is a former UNICEF official who served as governor of Iran’s oil-rich Khuzestan province under the U.S.-backed shah. He was arrested in 2016, apparently drawn to Iran over fears about his incarcerated son detained in 2015.He was placed under house arrest for medical reasons in 2018 but prevented from leaving Iran despite his family’s pleas that he travel to receive emergency heart surgery after suffering multiple hospitalizations.Last October, he underwent surgery in Iran to clear a blockage in an artery to the brain that his family and supporters described as life-threatening.AdvertisementSecurity forces arrested his son, Siamak Namazi, an advocate of closer ties between Iran and the West, while he was visiting Iran on a business trip.Both Namazis were sentenced to 10 years in prison in Iran on what the U.S. and U.N. say were trumped-up spying charges.The U.N.’s Working Group on Arbitrary Detention dismissed the cases against the two men, saying in 2017 their case is part of “an emerging pattern involving the arbitrary deprivation of liberty of dual nationals.”“There is no evidence either Mr. S. Namazi or Mr. B. Namazi had a criminal record, including in relation to national security offenses,” their report read. “There is nothing to indicate that they have ever acted against the national interests of the Islamic Republic of Iran.”___Lee reported from Washington.",Matthew Lee and Jon Gambrell | AP,"Detained Iranian-American, 85, leaves Iran for major surgery"

Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine.ArrowRightIf Debretsion Gebremichael attends the proposed talks between the Tigray and Ethiopian sides, it will be the highest-level effort yet to end the two-year war that has killed thousands of people from conflict and starvation. In a statement, he said he is ready to send a negotiating team but has questions about who else might take part, “considering that we were not consulted prior to the issuance of this invitation.”Ethiopia’s government has accepted the invitation, national security adviser Redwan Hussein said. In a separate statement, the government called it “consistent with the Ethiopian government’s prior positions” that talks be mediated by the AU and be held without preconditions. The statement does not say who might attend.AdvertisementThe letter from the chair of the AU Commission says the AU-convened talks would be “aimed at laying the foundation for a structured and sustained mediation” between the two sides toward a “durable resolution of the conflict.”The AU letter says the talks would be facilitated by AU special envoy and former Nigerian President Olesegun Obasanjo with the support of former Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta and former South African Deputy President Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka.A diplomat in Addis Ababa said representatives from the European Union, the United Nations and the regional Intergovernmental Authority on Development are expected to attend the talks as observers in support of the AU’s mediation team. The diplomat spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.The talks come more than a month after fighting in Tigray renewed following months of relative calm. Forces from neighboring Eritrea, allied with Ethiopia’s government, are again joining the fighting in what Tigray forces have described as a large-scale offensive.AdvertisementOn Tuesday, an airstrike hit the Tigray town of Adi Daero where displaced people were sheltering, a humanitarian worker who visited the site afterward told the AP. They described the scene as “total carnage” and said health workers reported more than 50 people killed. The worker spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.The Tigray region has been largely cut off from the world since the war began in November 2020, with more than 5 million people without basic services including electricity, phone, internet and banking. Medicines have run desperately low. On Thursday, the U.N. said trapped staffers were finally able to rotate out of the region for the first time since the fighting renewed.The fighting also has spilled over into Ethiopia’s neighboring regions of Amara and Afar as Tigray forces have tried to pressure the government, putting hundreds of thousands of other civilians at risk.AdvertisementUnited Nations-based investigators have said all sides have committed abuses.There is also deep suspicion on both sides. A member of the Tigray negotiation team, Tsadkan Gebretensae, told a U.S. think tank last week that “we have agreed on an African-led process, but that should not be carte blanche for the AU to impose what should be a peace process.”Tsadkan said Tigray representatives had met three times with Ethiopian authorities — in Djibouti and Seychelles — and he thanked the United States government for organizing the meetings, which he said produced a “clear proposal for a cessation of hostilities.” But after that, he asserted, the Tigray side was “betrayed.” He didn’t give details.The Tigray authorities seek unfettered access for humanitarian aid, the resumption of basic services, respect for constitutional boundary arrangements and the withdrawal of foreign forces, Tsadkan said.The Tigray authorities “will accept whatever comes out” of an impartial, agreed-upon peace process, he said.",Cara Anna | AP,"Ethiopia, Tigray head invited to peace talks in South Africa"

They were sparked by the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini after her arrest for allegedly violating the Islamic Republic’s strict dress code.Some of the Iranian demonstrators have publicly hacked off locks of hair at the protests, and the gesture has spread.Images of women elsewhere cutting their hair to show solidarity with Iranian women have gone viral — from Turkish singer Melek Mosso on stage last week, to women in Lebanon and Syria, to Swedish lawmaker Abir Al-Sahlani in the halls of the European Parliament in Strasbourg on Tuesday. A museum in Rome is collecting locks of hair to present to the Iranian Embassy.Advertisement“For women to cut their hair in Iran is a form of protest ... a symbol to stand against the mandatory hijab,” said Dorna Javan, an Iranian political scientist based in France and specialized in Iran. Such a visual gesture is a way for women across the world to rally around the Iranian women’s plight, she added.The video of Cotillard, Binoche and dozens of other women cutting off locks of their hair was released on an Instagram account, “soutienfemmesiran” — which translates as “support women in Iran.”“These women, these men are asking for our support. Their courage and their dignity obliges us,” said a post with the video.“We have decided to respond to the appeal made to us by cutting — us too — some of these locks.”Some of the other women who took part included actors Charlotte Rampling and Charlotte Gainsbourg, who was also filmed cutting off a lock of hair from the head of her mother, singer Jane Birkin.AdvertisementThis highly symbolic gesture also echoes Iranian history and folklore in which for women to chop their hair is a sign of protest. The Shahnameh (“The Book of Kings”), a national epic of Iran, Afghanistan and Tajikistan written by the Persian poet Ferdowsi between 977 and 1010 A.D., refers to a princess chopping her hair to protest against the death of her husband seen as unfair.“Women cutting their hair is an ancient Persian tradition also found in the Shahnameh, when the fury is stronger than the power of the oppressor,” tweeted Shara Atashi, an Iranian writer based in Wales.Researcher Javan described it as a “benevolent gesture,” and called for more robust political action from the international community to support Iranian protesters.“We can’t reduce the fight of Iranian women for their rights — which dates back to the second half of the 19th century — to the gesture of cutting their hair,” she said. “But these viral videos are a way to give an international impact to their fight.”___This story has been corrected to restore the correct spelling in the surname of Swedish lawmaker Abir Al-Sahlani.",Jade Le Deley and John Leicester | AP,France: Oscar winners cut off their hair for Iran protesters

The annexation followed Kremlin-orchestrated “referendums” in Ukraine that the Ukrainian government and the West have dismissed as illegitimate.The Russian president defended the validity of the vote, saying it’s “more than convincing” and “absolutely transparent and not subject to any doubt.”“This is objective data on people’s mood,” Putin said Wednesday at an event dedicated to teachers, adding that he was pleasantly “surprised” by the results.On the ground, Russia faced mounting setbacks, with Ukrainian forces retaking more and more land in the eastern and southern regions that Moscow now insists are its own.The precise borders of the areas Moscow is claiming remain unclear, but Putin has vowed to defend Russia’s territory — including the annexed regions — with any means at his military’s disposal, including nuclear weapons.AdvertisementShortly after Putin signed the annexation legislation, the head of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s office, Andriy Yermak, wrote on his Telegram channel that “the worthless decisions of the terrorist country are not worth the paper they are signed on.”“A collective insane asylum can continue to live in a fictional world,” Yermak added.Zelenskyy responded to the annexation by announcing Ukraine’s fast-track application to join NATO. In a decree released Tuesday, he also ruled out negotiations with Russia, declaring that Putin’s actions made talking to the Russian leader impossible.In the eastern Kharkiv region, more disturbing images emerged from areas recently reclaimed from Russia.Serhiy Bolvinov, who heads the investigative department of the national police in the region, said authorities are investigating an alleged Russian torture chamber in the village of Pisky-Radkivski.AdvertisementHe posted an image of a box of what appeared to be precious metal teeth and dentures presumably extracted from those held at the site. The authenticity of the photo could not be confirmed.Ukraine’s prosecutor general also spoke of new evidence of torture and killings found Wednesday in the Kharkiv region.Andriy Kostin told The Associated Press on the sidelines of a security conference in Warsaw that he had just been notified of four bodies found with signs of possible torture. He said they were believed to be civilians but an investigation was still needed.Two bodies were found in a factory in Kupiansk with their hands bound behind their backs, while two other bodies were found in Novoplatonivka, their hands linked by handcuffs.During his public speech, Kostin said officials found the bodies of 24 civilians, including 13 children and one pregnant woman, who had been killed in six cars near Kupiansk. It was not clear when the discovery was made.AdvertisementOn the battlefield, Russia and Ukraine gave conflicting assessments of a Ukrainian counter-offensive in the Russian-occupied southern Kherson region. A Moscow-installed regional official insisted that Ukrainian advances had been halted.“As of this morning ... there are no movements” by Kyiv’s forces, Kirill Stremousov said Wednesday in comments to state-run Russian news agency RIA Novosti. He vowed the Ukrainian fighters would not enter the city of Kherson.However, the Ukrainian military said the Ukrainian flag had been raised above seven Kherson region villages previously occupied by the Russians. The closest of the liberated villages to the city of Kherson is Davydiv Brid, some 100 kilometers (60 miles) away.The deputy head of the Ukrainian regional government, Yurii Sobolevskyi, said military hospitals were full of wounded Russian soldiers and that Russian military medics lacked supplies. Once they are stabilized, Russian soldiers were getting sent to Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014.Advertisement“Not everyone arrives,” Sobolevskyi wrote.In the neighboring Mykolaiv region, the governor said Russian troops have started to withdraw from Snihurivka, a city of 12,000 that Moscow seized early in the war and annexed along with the Kherson region. A Russian-installed official in Snihurivka, Yury Barbashov, denied that Russian troops had lost control of the city, a strategic railway hub, but said the Ukrainian forces were advancing.In the Moscow-annexed eastern Donetsk region, where Ukrainian forces still control some areas, Russian forces shelled eight towns and villages, the Ukrainian presidential office said.After reclaiming the Donetsk city of Sviatohirsk, Ukrainian forces located a burial ground for civilians and found the bodies of four people, according to Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko.In the Luhansk region, also in the eastern Donbas, Gov. Serhiy Haidai said Ukrainian forces have retaken several villages. He did not name the villages, but said the retreating Russian forces are mining the roads and buildings.AdvertisementIn central Ukraine, multiple explosions rocked Bila Tserkva, a city about 80 kilometers (50 miles) south of the capital, Kyiv. Regional leader Oleksiy Kuleba said six Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones struck the city and set off fires at what he described as infrastructure facilities. One person was wounded.Russia has increasingly employed kamikaze or suicide drones in recent weeks, posing a new challenge to Ukrainian defenses. The unmanned vehicles can stay aloft for long periods of time before diving into targets and detonating their payloads at the last moment.Many of the earlier attacks with the Iranian-made drones happened in the south of Ukraine and not near the capital, which hasn’t been targeted for weeks.___Hanna Arhirova reported from Kyiv, Ukraine.___Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",Adam Schreck | AP,Putin signs annexation of Ukrainian regions as losses mount

35,"ROME — Police detained an American tourist at a Vatican museum after he disfigured two ancient Roman sculptures by hurling them to the floor, authorities said Thursday.The man toppled the artwork on Wednesday at the Chiaramonti Museum, which is part of the Vatican Museums and home to one of the most important collections of Roman portrait busts.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightItalian newspapers reported that the man grew angry because he was not allowed “to see the Pope.” A representative for the Vatican Museums told The Washington Post that his motive was unclear.Photos shared on social media, and confirmed by the museum representative to The Post, showed the damaged busts strewn on the marble floor. One had lost part of its nose and an ear, the museum said.The world’s cardinals, who will pick the next pope, get to know one anotherThe Vatican police had handed the man over to Italian authorities on Wednesday, Matteo Bruni, director of the Holy See Press Office, told The Post.AdvertisementA police spokesman said the 65-year-old had been in Rome for about three days and appeared to be “psychologically distressed.” He was given an aggravated property damage charge and released, the spokesman said.The man had a paid ticket and appeared to be there alone, one of 20,000 visitors that day, Vatican Museums spokesman Matteo Alessandrini said.“He smashed the two busts to the ground, one after the other,” Alessandrini said. Both of the toppled heads were from the ancient city of Rome, with one depicting an elderly man, and the other, a young man.When the first hit the ground, “the loud bang echoed through the long gallery,” he said. Two Vatican police officers stationed within the museum arrived within minutes and took the man into custody.Technicians are now working to reassemble the damaged sculptures, which had been swiftly taken to the museum’s restoration lab after the incident.AdvertisementThe pieces were fixable but would require 300 hours of restoration work, according to Alessandrini. “The scare was bigger than the actual damage,” he said.Rick Steves, who runs a Europe travel business, said that although all artifacts in the museum could be considered precious, the damaged pieces were relatively insignificant.A local’s guide to RomeFor Steves, the downside of such incidents may also be “the loss of access to beautiful art in general.”To avoid other incidents, the museum could choose to put more security up, as was the case after a notorious artwork assault in 1972. That year, a Hungarian geologist attacked Michelangelo’s Pietà in St. Peter’s Basilica with a hammer, damaging the Carrara marble sculpture depicting the Virgin Mary holding Jesus after the crucifixion. The statue was later repaired and put behind bulletproof glass.“The reality is you can’t even see the Pietà from the angle Michelangelo wanted you to see it,” Steves said. “He wanted you to be up close.”The Vatican museums, where millions of people a year flocked before the pandemic, reopened last year after coronavirus restrictions closed them or curbed opening hours.Francis reported from London.

37,"PARIS — European economists worried about a heightened risk of recession and a bolstered Russia on Thursday, after OPEC Plus, the coalition of oil-producing nations led by Russia and Saudi Arabia, announced that it will slash oil production by 2 million barrels per day.Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine.ArrowRightThe coalition’s plans prompted a blistering reaction from officials at the White House, which had aggressively lobbied the consortium to continue production at current levels or higher.While initial reactions were more muted in the European Union, the production cut comes as the bloc of 27 nations braces for a sharp slowdown in economic growth linked to higher energy prices. The E.U.'s industrial powerhouse, Germany, reported a worse-than-anticipated decline in manufacturing orders on Thursday, raising recession fears.OPEC, allies move to slash oil production, eliciting blistering White House responseSimone Tagliapietra, a senior fellow at Brussels-based economic think tank Bruegel, said the production cut “will sustain inflation and make Europe’s energy crisis even more complicated.”AdvertisementIt also makes the Group of Seven (G-7) price cap on Russian oil, which has just been given the green light by E.U. countries, “less impactful,” he said.While the production cut is expected to increase prices at European gas stations, the extent of the rise was not immediately clear. Oil prices could still exceed $100 per barrel, analysts said. Even before the production cut was announced, European business groups worried about companies replacing increasingly expensive natural gas with oil, which could drive gas station prices upward.Over the summer, many European nations tried to shield consumers from rising gas prices through subsidies and tax breaks. But similar intervention to tackle surging electricity and natural gas prices this fall has strained budgets, leaving some countries with diminished leeway to respond to Wednesday’s announcement. Germany’s increasingly precarious economic situation could also stand in the way of stronger E.U. action.AdvertisementThose factors could weigh heavily this winter, compounding the possibility of natural gas and electricity shortages and blackouts, and narrowing European companies’ profit margins. The concerns, however, were not immediately reflected on European markets Thursday. Germany’s leading index, Dax, and the European Stoxx 600 initially made slight gains.In European capitals, the production cut could pose immediate geopolitical challenges, however.Just hours before the OPEC Plus decision, E.U. member states had on Wednesday agreed to its own cap on the price of Russian oil as part of the bloc’s eighth round of sanctions over the war in Ukraine.The idea behind the cap is to set the price of Russian oil above the cost of production, but below market price, keeping the oil trade going while limiting Russian revenue.AdvertisementUnder the sanctions, E.U. and G-7 officials will meet to set the price, adjusting the level in response to market conditions, according to E.U. officials. Member states will need to unanimously approve the decision.To ensure compliance, the sanctions make companies involved in the transport of Russian oil, including insurers and shipowners, responsible for making sure their cargo is not sold above the cap.The U.S. treasury, which has pushed for the measure for months, says the price cap will “sharply” reduce Russian revenue.But some energy experts have raised questions about whether it will work as planned. Russia may decide to keep its oil off the market rather than selling at the cap price, further curtailing supply. And even if Russia continues to sell, a cap will only be effective if there is buy-in from every customer, including India and China, experts said.AdvertisementBut as “global oil prices will increase with this OPEC+ decision, some countries might have greater incentive to go for discounted Russian crude,” wrote Tagliapietra. It is possible that the OPEC Plus news will make Beijing and Delhi less likely to abide by the price cap.In the medium-term, those setbacks could test Europe’s resolve to support Ukraine. The planned cut to oil production “shows that the energy crisis in Europe is threatening to escalate into a global price war,” German business paper Handelsblatt warned in an analysis, arguing that the move pits Europe and the United States against OPEC, its partners, and large oil importers like China and India.For President Biden and European leaders who flew to Saudi Arabia this year in extraordinary efforts to press for more oil production, Wednesday’s OPEC Plus rebuke has also prompted uncomfortable questions about the diplomatic trade-offs they were willing to make — and the results they have to show for it.President Biden personally visited Saudi leaders in a trip to Jiddah this summer and fist-bumped Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, while French President Emmanuel Macron later engaged in a long handshake with Mohammed in Paris. In Greece, a top government member expressed public admiration for the crown prince’s “leadership” and “vision.” And German Chancellor Olaf Scholz visited the kingdom only days ago.Saudi crown prince engages in long handshake with Macron on rehabilitation tourFour years after the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, the Western outreach appears to have largely rehabilitated the crown prince.But for Europe and the United States, the efforts have ""remained fruitless,” according to Germany’s Handelsblatt.“As of today, it is clear to insiders: Saudi Arabia is on the side of Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin,” the paper wrote.Rauhala reported from Brussels.

38,"TORONTO — Canada’s top court is set to hear arguments Thursday on whether the United States is a safe destination for people seeking asylum.The case, which is being watched closely in Ottawa and Washington, could upend the deal under which the two countries have for nearly two decades shared responsibility for migrants in need of protection.Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine.ArrowRightAt issue is the constitutionality of the Safe Third Country Agreement, the 2004 pact between the two countries. Under the deal, asylum seekers who enter Canada at official land border crossings are sent back to the United States — and vice versa. The premise is that both nations meet their obligations under international refugee law and are safe for those seeking refuge, so claimants must request protection in the country where they first arrive.The appellants in the case before the Supreme Court of Canada are challenging the agreement’s foundations.AdvertisementThey include a Salvadoran woman and her daughters who fled gender-based persecution and gang violence; a family from Syria who sought asylum in Canada after President Donald Trump issued an executive order barring entry to people from seven majority-Muslim countries; and a Muslim woman from Ethiopia who feared her Oromo ethnicity made her a target for persecution.They argue that the pact violates the right of “life, liberty and security of the person” guaranteed by Canada’s constitution because it subjects asylum seekers who are bounced back to the United States to possible detention on the U.S. side and removal to the countries and persecution they sought to flee.That, they say, puts both countries at risk of violating international conventions on refugees that commit signatories to the principle of non-refoulement — refraining from sending refugees and asylum seekers back to countries where they could face the very persecution or torture they sought to flee.Advertisement“Absent this court’s intervention, refugees will continue to be transferred to the U.S. despite the real risk of refoulment from the U.S. for some of them,” the appellants wrote in their submission to the court.Canadian court says sending asylum seekers back to U.S. violates their rightsCanada’s ministers of immigration and public safety counter in court filings that the U.S. process for adjudicating asylum claims is “robust and fair” with “built-in protections and safeguards compliant with its non-refoulement obligations.”“The evidence … shows the continued designation of the United States remains reasonable,” they wrote. (The Canadian government does not make that evidence public.)A Canadian federal court disagreed. In a 2020 decision, the court in Ottawa said that while it was not the “role of the Court to pass judgment on the U.S. asylum system,” the Safe Third Country Agreement violated the constitutional right to life, liberty and security of the person.AdvertisementJustice Ann Marie McDonald pointed to the case of Nedira Mustefa, the Ethiopian asylum seeker. After Canada returned her to the United States in 2017, she was detained and placed temporarily in solitary confinement.“The evidence establishes that … applying” the agreement “will provoke certain, and known, reactions by U.S. officials,” McDonald wrote. “Canada cannot turn a blind eye to the consequences … The evidence clearly demonstrates that those who returned … are detained as a penalty.”Canada is turning asylum seekers away at the border. In the U.S., they face deportation.A federal appeals court last year overturned the lower court’s decision — in part, it said, because the evidence marshaled by the asylum seekers, “although voluminous, is somewhat piecemeal and individualized and, thus, is problematic for drawing systemwide inferences concerning the situation in the United States.”AdvertisementThe claimants and several advocacy groups, including Amnesty International, appealed to the Supreme Court.The Safe Third Country Agreement has long drawn criticism from refugee advocates and human rights groups. In 2007, they successfully petitioned a court to declare the United States unsafe for refugees, but that was also overturned on appeal.A death on the Canadian border: Dominican man was trying to reach his daughter in the U.S.The deal has drawn broader attention here in recent years because it has a loophole. While asylum seekers who enter the country at official land border crossings are sent back to the United States, those who make unauthorized entries elsewhere along the 5,500-mile border may stay and file their claims.Since 2017, more than 67,800 asylum seekers have entered Canada at such crossings and filed claims for protection. Around 28,300 claims have been accepted; around 19,600 have been rejected.The number of asylum seekers crossing into Canada at unofficial points of entry rose sharply under Trump, who sought to limit legal immigration, illegal immigration and asylum.AdvertisementSome dragged their belongings across the border in perilous winter journeys, losing limbs to frostbite.In a twist, Canada asks U.S. for help cracking down at its southern borderSuch crossings have not abated under President Biden. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police has “intercepted” more than 23,000 asylum seekers at unofficial border crossings during the first eight months of this year — the most since Canada began tracking the number in 2017.“While, yes, during the Trump administration, there were plenty examples of really horrific treatment of immigrants and refugees … it’s not the case that now there’s a new administration in power, so there’s no concern anymore,” said Julia Sande, a human rights law campaigner with Amnesty International in Canada. “A lot of the concerns still remain.”Florida man arrested after 4 people, including infant and teenage boy, found dead near U.S.-Canada borderPrime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government has pressed U.S. officials to extend the Safe Third Country Agreement to cover the entire U.S.-Canada border, not just official crossings. Advocates argue that that would not stop the movement of asylum seekers; it would just push them to pursue more dangerous routes to avoid authorities.AdvertisementThe Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment.The Canadian ministers, in their submission to the court, asked that any declaration that the agreement was invalid be suspended for 12 months so that the government could respond. They said there were likely to be operational challenges at the U.S.-Canada border given that it would mean asylum seekers could make claims at official land crossings.“It is vital during that time to preserve certainty and order at Canada’s land border,” the ministers wrote. “There may be a range of remedies available to the government to respond to the declaration and there are significant competing and complex policy matters including foreign policy considerations that must be accommodated.”",Amanda Coletta,Canada’s top court to hear arguments: Is U.S. safe for asylum seekers?
39,"TRIPOLI, Lebanon — As Dua Abdel Nour floated in the endless sea, her torso flattened on a plank of wood and her hand clutching onto her college sweetheart, she found herself imagining what she must look like from above, her head bobbing in the water like a character in a disaster film. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine.ArrowRightFor 36 hours, she and her husband of four months fought to stay alive after the boat that was supposed to smuggle them from Lebanon to Europe sank. They were parched and hungry, their arms and legs inflamed from fighting against the ceaseless waves. Her life vest had bunched up around her neck, stripping her skin right off.“He kept telling me, ‘I can’t anymore,’ ” Abdel Nour, 22, said of her husband, Zein al-Deen Hamad, 24. But she wouldn’t let go. “I told him, ‘If you drown, I drown.’ ”The couple was saved by fishing boats dispatched from the Syrian island of Arwad to look for survivors of the capsized boat, which had set out before dawn on Sept. 21 carrying around 140 people. At least 100 bodies have so far been retrieved. Those rescued were treated in Syria’s coastal city of Tartous, and the Lebanese among them were sent home.AdvertisementLebanon has always been a place of haves and have-nots, but the gulf between them has widened to an extraordinary degree. In the northern cities of Tripoli and Akkar, and the surrounding villages, many people now live without electricity and running water. Residents call the area “the forgotten North” and are going to desperate lengths to escape.A tragedy at sea shakes the poorest city in LebanonIn Syria, Abdel Nour learned that the baby she was pregnant with had died. When she returned to Tripoli, she visited the government hospital for an abortion, only to be told by the physician that, due to a lack of funds, they can only take emergency cases. He advised her to come back “when she starts bleeding.”She spent days hunting for the pills the doctor had prescribed, but they left her in agonizing pain and didn’t finish the job. Her panic grew: Abdel Nour has a nursing degree and knows the perils of not expelling a dead fetus.AdvertisementFinally, someone heard about her case and called the health minister, who intervened to put an end to her nightmare.“This is what it’s come to: You need a wasta even if you’re dying,” she said, using an Arabic word that denotes a mix of favoritism, nepotism and connections. It has long ruled the lives of those in Lebanon. And as the country collapses, it is sometimes the only currency left.“Tripoli and Akkar are isolated from Lebanon. It’s like they’re not in the country,” Abdel Nour said. “The poverty here is surreal.”Lebanon’s leaders have failed to address what the World Bank has called one of the world’s worst economic crises since the mid-19th century. The local currency has lost over 96 percent of its value since 2019. Salaries have not caught up, for those lucky enough to still have jobs.Another bank heist in Beirut, another hero for Lebanon’s weary publicIn the absence of government services, such as health care and electricity, the country has been carved into spheres of influence, with residents turning to local politicians to meet their most basic needs.AdvertisementAbdel Nour graduated at the top of her class but said no one would hire her. She watched as peers with wasta filled positions others more worthy had applied for. “You get desperate here,” she said, speaking from her in-laws’ house where she and her husband share a single room.“I studied and worked hard and now find that those who have lesser degrees than mine got employed and are getting promoted, and I’m still where I am.”She was further disheartened when she lost out on two job offers in Saudi Arabia. She applied for a passport more than a year ago but, like many Lebanese hoping for a way out, is still waiting. Those with wasta get to skip the line.“That’s what pushed us to get out of where we are, this system of wasta and favoritism, to go to a civilized country without these kinds of [political] parties,” Abdel Nour said.AdvertisementHer husband gave up his nursing degree and joined the army to support her studies — “she’s smarter than me,” Hamad explained — but the army’s budget has been slashed. Their meals consisted of two pieces of bread per soldier and a can of tuna divided between several men.“And they ask you why are you going to the sea,” Abdel Nour said sardonically.Lebanon’s prime minister, Najib Mikati, hails from Tripoli, and he is on Forbes’s list of the world’s top 1,000 billionaires. But the country’s second-largest city remains desperately poor, a place without a patron.Its neighborhoods still bear the marks of the civil war that ended in 1990, dotted with collapsing facades riddled with bullet holes. The streets are crowded with 1970s-era Mercedes-Benz cars, often held together with tape and rope. Darkness floods most residential buildings, where the elevators have become decorative.AdvertisementHamad’s father said they now use their fridge as a cabinet: inside are a few jars of pickles, some bread, one tomato.There’s been no running water for months because the pumps run on fuel, a luxury item nowadays. In its absence, people buy gallons of water from deliverymen like Wissam al-Talawi, who took the only job he could find to support his family. Unable to imagine a future here, he, too, decided to get on the boat with his wife and four kids.He sold his house and everything he owned and borrowed money to pay the $18,000 for the trip. When he saw the overcrowded boat, he and most of the passengers, as well as the captain, wanted to turn back. But the smugglers wanted their money and wouldn’t allow it. “They told [the captain], ‘We’ll shoot your kids,’ ” he said.Only 2½ hours into the journey, the motor failed and the boat began to sink. People jumped in the water and, in the chaos, Talawi lost his wife, Salma, and two of his children, Mahmoud and Maya. He would not see them again. His two other kids were still with him, though, struggling to tread water and stay alive under the beating sun.“I just kept kissing them,” he said, his tears falling freely. “They’d tell me they want water; I kept telling them, ‘Soon God will give us some reprieve.’ I told them, ‘Forgive me, my loves. Forgive me.’ ”He watched his son, Ammoura, drown. Then he attached his life jacket to that of his daughter, Mimi, and put her arms around his neck, drifting in and out of consciousness as he tried to keep them afloat, waking up each time to her tiny voice: “Daddy, I’m with you. Don’t leave me.” But he couldn’t save her either.Advertisement“I can’t sleep. I can’t sleep,” he said, his voice thinning in agony. “I told them, ‘Forgive me.’ I couldn’t, I couldn’t see them. I would just hear my daughter’s voice. Her voice cuts me. Her voice.”He hoped he could give his children a better life, dreaming of running water and free education in Germany. He was tired of not being able to provide for them.As he spoke, an ice cream truck passed by, its “Für Elise” jingle drifting through the open window.“That’s the ice cream guy. Every time he’d pass, my son would hear him and want ice cream,” Talawi remembered, a laugh trickling into his voice. “When your child asks you for something and you can’t offer it to them, you feel wrong. You feel as if you failed.”Suzan Haidamous reported from Washington. ",Sarah Dadouch,"In Lebanon’s ‘forgotten north,’ despair drives people to the sea"
40,"SEOUL — Kim Kang-woo had already made the treacherous journey across North Korea’s border into China. Now, he was about to do the unthinkable — smuggle himself back in.Wearing a black hoodie and concealing a knife, he blended in among merchants on the Chinese side of the Yalu River while he waited for the North Korean soldiers to drop their guard. He waded into the water at sunset, and cried silently as he considered what awaited him on the other side: Death, imprisonment, or reuniting with his mom.“When I thought about my mother, there was really only one path,” he said. “I had to go back. And if I got caught crossing back in, I was ready to die.”AdvertisementMore than 33,800 North Koreans have made their way to the South in search of freedom from poverty and oppression since Seoul began keeping track of their entry in 1998. Countless others have fled to China, Russia and elsewhere. It is common for defectors who have resettled in South Korea to arrange brokers to help family members back home to escape. But it is rare for anyone to go back into North Korea, and even rarer for them to make it back to South Korea a second time. Yet Kim did both to help his mother — and was duly convicted and imprisoned in the South.In their first interview with a news outlet, Kim and his mother recalled their terrifying and winding journey to be together again, the determination that fueled them during four years of separation and failed attempts to reunite, and their new life in Seoul filled with trauma and hope.The Washington Post has verified Kim’s return to North Korea and second escape through court records, but cannot corroborate the accounts of what took place inside the reclusive country. Details of their hometown have been withheld to protect their relatives who remain there.Chasing dreamsLike most North Koreans, Kim learned about everyday life in Seoul through a South Korean television show smuggled in from China. As he watched the character Jung Woo in the 2009 miniseries “Swallow the Sun,” in which a homeless orphan eventually finds love and success, Kim thought he, too, may have a chance at new opportunities in the South.Kim, soft-spoken with an easy smile, was a studious kid growing up in a border town near China. He graduated at the top of his class in high school but could not attend college because he was from a poor family and those opportunities were reserved for people from a higher class. When he turned 20, he reflected on his life as a farmer and laborer, who worked to support the nuclear-armed regime while he and his mother sometimes didn’t have enough to eat.AdvertisementHe wanted more. A college degree. A stable job. He told his mother, Im Su-ryuh, he intended to leave for the South and asked her to wait three years. She gave her only son a boiled egg before he left, which he placed right back in her hands. She couldn’t see him off, for fear of raising suspicions from neighborhood watchers, and cried in silence for many nights after he left. Her husband had died making the same trek years earlier.“He told me, ‘I can’t rot in this country for the rest of my life,’ ” said Im, 51. “I couldn’t stop him, nor could I encourage him.”Kim Kang-woo told his mother, Im Su-ryuh, that he intended to leave North Korea to start a new life in the South. Im couldn’t stop him or encourage him. (Video: The Washington Post)Her son’s departure came like a lightning bolt for Im. “I felt like I could still see him right in front of me. I felt sorry that he met the wrong mother, who couldn’t give him a better life. I thought I would never see him again,” she said.It was pouring rain the night in May 2016 when Kim crossed the Yalu River alone. He arrived in Seoul after a five-month journey through China, Laos and Thailand, a common route for defectors. (Crossing directly between North and South Korea was out of the question; the border is heavily militarized.) Eleven months after he left home, Im got word that her son had made it to the buzzing southern capital.AdvertisementKim worked every job he could land — in construction, at a mattress store, at a cellphone store. He thought about his mom each night as he walked home from work, and whenever he ate a delicious meal.By 2019, he had saved enough money and met a broker he trusted. He could finally arrange his mom’s escape. And he was right on time.A homecomingIn May that year, Kim booked a plane ticket to China. He wanted to help his mother through the grueling journey to freedom. But risking his life a second time was not in his plan.After making his way to the North Korean border, he worked with a broker who was to arrange his mother’s escape. But he couldn’t reach his mother.North Koreans who live along the border use smuggled Chinese cellphones that can pick up Chinese cellular networks for phone calls. His mother finally called on a cellphone she borrowed.AdvertisementIm told her son, then 23, that she was scared. She didn’t have her own phone, and was worried she wouldn’t be able to find him on the Chinese side. Maybe they should try again another time, she said. Then the line dropped.The plan had fallen apart.Kim panicked. He was running out of money and his visa would expire soon. He had exhausted everything to make it to this point, and wasn’t sure when he could return.As he considered going back in to North Korea, he worried for his safety and that of his family. If he were caught reentering after defecting, he and his family could be killed.“I hesitated because I was terrified. But I felt like I would never see my mom again,” he said.When Kim Kang-woo’s plan to bring his mother out of North Korea fell apart, he went back into North Korea, risking his life a second time. (Video: The Washington Post)For two days, he watched North Korean guards’ movements from the Chinese side of the river to learn their schedule. The second day, as the guards stopped for dinner, he crossed back in. Then he dashed into the woods.A lot had changed in his hometown, and he realized he had changed, too. He had pierced his ears and dyed his hair dark brown. He had worked to get rid of his North Korean accent while working in retail, and caught himself using South Korean slang. He couldn’t blend in as easily as he had hoped.He made his way back to his mother’s house and knocked on the door. Im was stunned. The two held each other in silence and cried. Then immediately, Im feared for their safety.Advertisement“He is crazy. My happiness lasted a short moment, then the hair on my skin stood up. If he’s caught, he would be immediately executed and the rest of us would go to a prison camp,” she said.Over the next 22 days, Kim worked to arrange brokers on either side of the border to get both of them into China. But it was not easy to arrange the trip so quickly, especially when brokers were incredulous when he told them he had returned to North Korea.One of the many calls he made during those days got picked up by government surveillance, Kim said. When Kim was not in the house, intelligence officials raided his mother’s home and detained her. Interrogators beat her and baited her to admit that her defector son had reentered, she said — a charge she repeatedly denied.Kim hid at the house of a friend, who told him he needed to leave North Korea for the sake of his family. According to South Korean court records, Kim left North Korea for the second time the day after his mother was detained.He crossed the Yalu River once again, without his mother.A fresh ordealKim received a phone call after he landed in Seoul. It was a South Korean intelligence official. “We have been waiting for you,” the man said.That’s how Kim learned the South Korean government had tracked his journey using cellphone records. He was interrogated for weeks, as the police worked to determine whether he was a spy.It is illegal for a South Korean to enter North Korea without approval from the Unification Ministry. According to the South Korean judge’s ruling in Kim’s case in August 2020, Kim faced a maximum three-year prison sentence. But the judge showed leniency after Kim expressed his regret and prosecutors determined Kim had no history of breaking a similar law affecting inter-Korean relations. His sentence was reduced to six months’ imprisonment and two years under probation.AdvertisementAfter one of the interrogation sessions, Kim received a call from a broker. His mother had safely made it out of North Korea. Kim couldn’t believe it, and demanded a photo and a chance to talk to her by phone. After he heard his mother’s voice, he arranged for his South Korean contacts to help her make her way through China, Laos and Thailand.“I was incredibly happy. I felt like I was born again,” he said, recalling the phone call.“I never thought that day would come,” Im said.By North Korean standards, South Korean prison was quite luxurious. There were regular meals, with a rotating menu. Kim could read as many books as he wanted. His debts to brokers piled up because he could not work, but otherwise, life was comfortable.He had not told his mother about his arrest, but when she arrived in Seoul and couldn’t reach her son, she became suspicious. His friends, upon prodding, eventually revealed his whereabouts.“My heart sank. My son, who had simply wanted to get a college education, was in prison because of me,” she said.When Im Su-ryuh finally arrived in Seoul after making a dangerous escape from North Korea, she found out that her son was in prison. (Video: The Washington Post)Im wrote her son letters every week. Sharing her observations about life in the South helped her feel less alone.I got my driver’s license today.Today is your grandmother’s birthday. Remember when we celebrated together in North Korea?I rode the subway today, and sat next to a young man who looked just like you. I wished you were here with me, and that it was really you riding the subway next to me.She counted down the days to her son’s release on Sept. 13, 2020. At midnight, she waited outside the prison. She had imagined he had been living in prison conditions like in North Korea, and had worried about his health.AdvertisementThey finally reunited outside the prison gates, more than four years after Kim first fled North Korea.“When he came out, he looked so weak and small in my eyes,” she said.“I actually gained so much weight … I barely moved!” he said.“I never notice when he says he gained weight,” she said. “I just want him to be healthy.”Trauma and hopeIm’s Seoul apartment, one of the units provided by the South Korean government to defectors, is decorated with her knitting and cross-stitching projects. She is not working at the moment, but is receiving training and other support from the South Korean government so she can eventually find a job. She enjoys gardening on her balcony, and is impressed at how she can control the temperature in her apartment so her plants can keep growing. In North Korea, her plants died in the winter because there was no heating system.Kim lives 40 minutes away. He drives over in his Mercedes-Benz, which he is determined to pay off as soon as possible. Kim gets his haircuts from a salon now, rather than from his mom like in North Korea, and is grateful he no longer has to worry about nicks in his ears from his mom’s scissors. She still wants to cut his hair, and wishes he would stop wearing torn jeans.“It’s fashion,” he told her.AdvertisementKim, now 27, is not working right now so he can focus on getting into college. He has applied to six colleges to study international relations. He likes to work out and watch movies, especially ones that stay with him emotionally long after he leaves the theater.With their lingering trauma, life in North Korea doesn’t feel too distant. Kim avoids going on trips to the mountains with his friends, because the woods remind him of hiding in North Korea. Im hates the noise of South Korean politicians delivering campaign speeches on loudspeakers, because it reminds her of the regime propaganda that would blare outside her home in North Korea.Kim Kang-woo said July 12 that he and his mother still struggle with recurring nightmares after they escaped North Korea. (Video: The Washington Post)When Kim first arrived in South Korea, he was shocked at how little South Koreans seemed to know about their northern neighbor. Some would ask if he was trained to kill people.“Like South Koreans, we’re people too. North Koreans have human rights too, even though it’s not respected. But they all deserve to live and be loved,” he said.On the refrigerator in Im’s apartment hangs a letter from her son.Dear mom, whom I love and respect always,Thank you for raising me with love. Please be healthy for years to come, so we can live happily.Julie Yoon contributed to this report.",Michelle Ye Hee Lee,"He escaped North Korea, then risked everything to go back for his mom"
41,"The awarding Friday of the 2022 Nobel Peace Prize comes at a particularly fraught moment, amid Europe’s biggest land war since World War II, major increases in food and energy prices and growing alarm over talk of using nuclear weapons.Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine.ArrowRightWhile the nominations closed in February — before the invasion of Ukraine — it is widely believed the war could have an effect on the final selection, as the Norwegian Nobel Committee often makes political statements with its choices.In 2021, the committee put the focus on freedom of the press with awards to embattled journalists Dmitry Muratov of Russia and Maria Ressa of the Philippines, while in 2020, it feted the World Food Program. In light of current events, 2022 might be about politics again.Here are some of the contenders as chosen by the Peace Research Institute of Oslo, whose shortlists in the past have included the 2019 winner, Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, and the 2018 winners, humanitarians Denis Mukwege and Nadia Murad.Russian and Belarusian oppositionTwo likely possibilities could be the most prominent opposition figures in Russia and its close ally Belarus: Alexei Navalny and Svetlana Tikhanovskaya.AdvertisementNavalny, who has appeared on a string of shortlists over the years, is currently spending much of his time in solitary confinement at a Russian high-security penal colony 155 miles east of Moscow following convictions on embezzlement and other charges that rights groups have described as bogus.His anti-corruption organization has highlighted the misdeeds of Vladimir Putin’s regime for years, resulting in his poisoning by Russian security forces with a banned nerve agent in August 2020. After a convalescence in Germany, however, he returned to Russia in January 2021 and was immediately imprisoned.From his cell, he has managed to repeatedly condemn the war in Ukraine and Putin’s “criminal mobilization because of which tens of thousands of people are going to die in trenches.”After her husband was imprisoned just two days following his announcement in 2020 that he would run for president, Tikhanovskaya became the leader of the opposition in Belarus against long-serving strongman and close Putin ally Alexander Lukashenko.AdvertisementLukashenko’s reelection victory in August 2020 was widely described as rigged, but the ensuing protests were crushed. Tikhanovskaya and her two children fled the country out of fear for their safety. But in the years since she became the face of a movement challenging Lukashenko’s rule, Tikhanovskaya has continued to present herself as Belarus’s legitimate leader.Chinese activistsThe doomed 2019 pro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong gained worldwide attention, as did China’s brutal treatment of the Uyghur minority in the far northwest of the country, which was addressed in a long-delayed United Nations report released in August.The committee could send a message by awarding the prize to activists such as Nathan Law and Agnes Chow of Hong Kong or Ilham Tohti, an imprisoned Uyghur scholar.AdvertisementLaw, who was given political asylum in Britain last year, is one of the most prominent of the Hong Kong activists in exile. He co-founded the pro-democracy Demosisto party in 2016 and was briefly elected as a lawmaker in the city before being disqualified for not taking the oath of office correctly.He fled the country before the passage of a draconian national security law in 2020 that outlawed most protests and snagged many of his fellow activists, including Chow.She gained prominence as a 15-year-old spokesperson of the 2012 student protests and went on to participate in most of Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movements, including the Demosisto party. She was eventually arrested and imprisoned for 10 months for her role in the 2019 protests and was released in June 2021. She remains in Hong Kong.AdvertisementTohti, a professor of economics, has been imprisoned for life since 2014 on charges of advocating separatism. In 2006, he established a website to draw attention to the discrimination faced by Uyghurs, as well as provide a platform for exchange between Uyghurs and Han Chinese, China’s largest ethnic group. He was arrested in January 2014 and convicted in September after a two-day trial.Interfaith championThe selection of Harsh Mander, an activist for interfaith harmony in India, would cast a harsh spotlight on the growing religious polarization in the country that many say has been fueled by the right-wing Hindu nationalist government.Beginning in 2017, Mander, 67, led activists, writers, lawyers and artists in his Karwan-e-Mohabbat, or Caravan of Love, across India to visit families affected by communal bloodshed.AdvertisementMander has been highly critical of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his policies, which Mander says deepen the religious cleavages in the country and are discriminatory toward Muslims.The ‘World Court’In a time of increased rivalry among the global powers and competing narratives about world events, there is a degree of yearning for international institutions that can present impartial opinions, which makes the 77-year-old International Court of Justice, or “World Court,” an attractive candidate.“Despite having no binding force, the Court’s advisory opinions nevertheless carry great legal weight and moral authority,” the court has noted about itself, and it has been an instrument of preventive diplomacy to keep the peace.Established in 1945 after World War II, the ICJ is the main United Nations judicial body with a mandate to settle legal disputes between countries and provide advisory opinions on matters of law referred to it by other U.N. bodies.AdvertisementOn March 16, the court ordered Russia to completely stop its military operations in Ukraine. The decision is seen as mostly symbolic, as the court lacks a viable way to enforce its ruling.Research and activismIf the committee decides to go the route of activism, two organizations that work on human rights and peaceful responses to conflict that might catch its eye are the San Francisco-based Human Rights Data Analysis Group (HRDAG) and the Center for Applied Nonviolent Action and Strategies (CANVAS), an organization based in Belgrade.HRDAG aims to bring the rigor of scientific analysis to human rights, with investigations into conflicts, while CANVAS educates activists about nonviolent resistance to autocratic regimes and the promotion of human rights and democracy.Though HRDAG and CANVAS are not directly linked, they were formed in a similar period of activism around the turn of the millennium. Both organizations have worked on similar causes.AdvertisementThey carried out significant work during the Arab Spring, with CANVAS initially advising anti-government protesters in Syria before a violent government response to demonstrations helped precipitate civil war.HRDAG gained renown at the start of the war, when it was one of the few organizations that tried to put a number on the war’s enormous toll in Syrian lives.Robyn Dixon and Mary Ilyushina in Riga, Latvia; Theodora Yu in Hong Kong; Lily Kuo in Taipei, Taiwan; Gerry Shih and Niha Masih in New Delhi; and Maite Fernández Simon and Adam Taylor in Washington contributed to this report.",Paul Schemm,A look at the top contenders for the 2022 Nobel Peace Prize
42,"As Ukrainian forces endeavor to capitalize on recent battlefield wins, winter’s rapid approach threatens to stalemate the conflict and offer Russian commanders a chance to stall their momentum.Falling temperatures are expected to increase troops’ demand for even the most basic provisions, straining supply lines that are already overtaxed.Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine.ArrowRightRain and snow will muddy the battlefield, rendering heavy military vehicles and equipment functionally immovable. It’s a particular concern in the south, where heavy fighting is ongoing and the ground has failed to freeze over in recent years.Many Ukrainians anticipate Russia will attack civilian infrastructure that supplies heat and electricity to major cities, just in time for the frost.In a few short weeks, for almost everybody with a stake in the fight, life is about to get much more difficult. And at that point, observers say, the war will become a battle over which side can better withstand the other’s efforts to destroy morale.Advertisement“Russian strategy across the region is not about moving the front line; it’s about causing pain on civilians who are far away from the front line,” said Sam Charap, a Russia expert with the Rand Corp. Russian leaders might be mistaken in betting the winter will prove “too tough” for Ukrainians and their European benefactors, but “they’re going to do their best to make it so,” he said.Ukraine hammers Russian forces into retreat on east and south frontsThe seasonal shift approaches as emboldened Ukrainian forces rack up significant wins, ejecting Russian units from occupied territory in the east, south and north. In September, they reclaimed ground in the Kharkiv region. Currently, they are making gains around Kherson — the only land Russia has held west of the Dnieper River — after retaking the strategic hub of Lyman, a potential springboard for pressing deeper into the Luhansk and Donetsk regions.Russian President Vladimir Putin has responded by ordering the mobilization of up to 300,000 military reservists, declaring an annexation of occupied territory and threatening to use nuclear weapons to achieve his aims. The rhetoric has amplified a persistent concern among some of Ukraine’s allies who fear providing certain advanced weapons will provoke Putin into doing something wildly escalatory and irreversible.AdvertisementThe question now: How much can Ukraine accomplish with this burst of momentum, using the types of arms and equipment it has and knows how to use, when the window for introducing new and potentially game-changing weapons onto the battlefield is probably closed until the spring?The Pentagon’s latest security package, announced Tuesday, appears to underscore this. In detailing the additional artillery, ammunition and mine-resistant vehicles being rushed to the war zone, U.S. officials emphasized that Ukrainians have “demonstrated the ability to use these capabilities,” enabling their advances. NATO defense ministers, who have committed to designing a long-term strategy for arming Ukraine, are set to meet in Brussels next week.Putin faces limits of his military power as Ukraine recaptures landFighters on both sides of the conflict are familiar with operating in winter. The opening weeks of the war, for instance, were so cold that underequipped Russian troops suffered frostbite, which slowed but failed to stop the invasion. Ukraine’s allies have increased supplies of coats, hats and other insulating clothing to give its personnel an advantage over the elements.AdvertisementAnother concern for Ukrainian commanders is the risk that certain weapons will become degraded by the harsh weather. It’s unclear, observers say, how durable its military systems are, given their heavy use. And operating such equipment in the cold will require more energy, with snow accumulation only complicating the transport of fuel and parts.“Basic mechanics start breaking down, and anything that is liquid-based becomes more difficult, too,” said Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.), a U.S. Marine Corps veteran who served in a cold-weather mountain unit. Fuel demands, he said, will skyrocket. “If you want to keep your generators going, you can’t shut down. The chance of it restarting is impossible.”The looming cold presents both armies with a strategic dilemma, experts say: By sticking close together and sharing resources, it is possible for military units to minimize demand on supply lines. The problem, they say, is that doing so increases vulnerability to attack.AdvertisementU.S. officials and others who have closely tracked the war say that Russian supply lines already have proved weak and that its military difficulties will only worsen once the 300,000 conscripts and reservists are thrown into the mix. According to Pentagon officials, it is not possible for Russia to adequately scale up its logistical operations before winter hits.“Fighting through the thick of the winter is going to suck for these soldiers, on both sides,” said Col. Dave Butler, a spokesman for the Joint Chiefs of Staff. But Ukraine will enjoy “one key advantage,” he added: “local support.”Throughout the war, Ukrainian personnel have relied on such help. Sometimes civilians help sustain soldiers with food and fuel. Other times, they might provide shelter or a vehicle. What remains to be seen is how well Ukrainian civilians will be positioned this winter to continue serving as a backstop.AdvertisementPresident Volodymyr Zelensky has predicted Russia will target his country’s electrical grid, insisting in an interview with CBS News last month that the Ukrainian people are “not afraid” and are determined to “live through this winter.” But those in Zelensky’s army worry it will be difficult to bear.“People are really in danger of being left without heat, electricity and water,” Daria Zubenko, who commands a Ukrainian army platoon, said in an interview during a recent trip to Washington where she and other military personnel petitioned U.S. government officials and lawmakers for more security aid.U.S. officials appear to share such concerns. “I’m worried about Ukraine’s continued ability to function as a country,” said Rep. Michael Waltz (R-Fla.), fearful it could “become energy-starved, and perhaps even head into an economic crisis this winter.”Citing discovery of mass graves, Ukraine presses case for modern tanksUkraine and its supporters are clamoring for more advanced Western weapons to secure territorial gains before winter complicates the military’s counteroffensives. Zelensky and his aides have zeroed in on two: tanks, particularly the German-made Leopard, and aircraft, which they say will enable Ukrainian forces to better protect their territory.“How far we get before it gets cold, the more lives we save,” Zubenko said, frustrated that Europe’s dependency on Russian fuel seemed to be influencing its willingness to contribute more powerful weapons. “We know that European countries are concerned about their bills, about electricity. … But, I don’t know, maybe it’s not that bad as living without electricity and heating at all.”In the West, skepticism remains about supplying Ukraine with more-advanced systems in the short term.AdvertisementLaura Cooper, a senior Pentagon official, told reporters Tuesday that the United States agrees Ukraine needs more tanks but that Soviet systems are probably best as its military already knows how to operate them. U.S. officials have warned that new weapons, including tanks and aircraft, require significant training and present additional maintenance and resupply demands that Ukraine may not yet be equipped to handle.All of those elements need to be launched “as a total package,” according to a U.S. defense official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss military contributions to Ukraine.“You can’t mount an offensive to kick the Russians out of Ukraine today,” another said, noting that what Ukraine needs is a “long-term plan to rebuild an army to kick out the Russians.”AdvertisementAndriana Arekhta, a volunteer in Ukraine’s army, bristled at such rationale. She said she has fought in battle from the back of a pickup truck because there were not enough armored vehicles. Arekhta acknowledged that “yes, we need training” and that the Ukrainian advance probably “will stop, for example in November or December, until spring.” But that is not, she believes, reason for the West to deny Ukraine all of the help it needs, particularly when it comes to better securing the country from the Russian missile attacks they believe are coming.“Critically, we need a ground air defense system,” she said. “People [will] not survive during winter, hungry and frozen. Is the civilized world ready to see that?”",Karoun Demirjian,Winter nears in Ukraine — and a battle of stamina awaits
43,"Drone and helicopter footage captured off the coast of South Africa provides what scientists say is the first direct proof that orcas are capable of hunting and killing one of the world’s largest sea predators: the great white shark.10 steps you can take to lower your carbon footprintArrowRightA study published this week in the journal Ecology details a more than hour-long pursuit of a number of white sharks by a pod of killer whales off Mossel Bay, a harbor town in South Africa’s Western Cape province. At least two white sharks were killed over a 71-minute period in May, the researchers said.“This behavior has never been witnessed in detail before, and certainly never from the air,” the study’s lead author, Alison Towner, a shark biologist at Marine Dynamics Academy in Gansbaai, South Africa, said in a statement.The footage could help explain the disappearance of great white sharks off the coast of South Africa in recent years, a decline that scientists and government officials had long suspected was due to killer whales, rather than illegal hunting or overfishing.Orcas have been known to prey on other shark species, but evidence that they hunt great whites had been limited to examining the carcasses of dead sharks washed ashore for signs of attack.AdvertisementA short drone clip of the attack was released in June. The new paper was published with more footage, as well as information from satellite tags, drone surveys and shark tour boats that suggest great white sharks fled the area around the time the killer whales began their pursuit. Only one great white was spotted in the 45 days after the attacks.In one video filmed by an amateur drone pilot, a group of five killer whales swam toward an area known for the presence of white sharks. Two whales were clearly visible on the surface as a third emerged from the depths, pushing a white shark that appeared to be dead. The whale bit into the shark and a large pool of blood was spotted.Is Florida’s hurricane shark real? The video is, at least.At about the same time, a helicopter pilot witnessed two sharks being killed by killer whales in the area. Short video clips and photos captured by the pilot appear to show the same group of killer whales from the drone video. Several appeared to show a shark liver floating on the surface, the researchers concluded, before being swallowed by a killer whale.AdvertisementThe footage may shed new light on the way white sharks try to evade orca attacks: staying within sight of their predator. That is a common strategy used by seals and tortoises to evade sharks, the researchers said. But that circling approach is probably ineffective for escaping orcas, which are social mammals and hunt in groups, cornering their prey, the scientists wrote.Despite being known as killer whales, orcas are actually the largest member of the dolphin family. They were given the nickname by early sailors who observed them hunting in groups and preying on larger whale species. They have been known to feed on everything from fish, seals and sea lions to octopuses and sea birds.“Killer whales are highly intelligent and social animals. Their group hunting methods make them incredibly effective predators,” said Simon Elwen, a marine mammal specialist at Stellenbosch University and a co-author of the study.",Rachel Pannett,Orca vs. shark: Rare drone footage shows killer whales mauling great whites
44,"A massive barrage of tear gas munitions fired by Indonesian police at soccer fans prompted the fatal crush in Malang last weekend that left at least 130 people dead, a Washington Post investigation shows.Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine.ArrowRightThe firing of at least 40 munitions at the crowd within a 10-minute span, in violation of national protocols and international security guidelines for soccer matches, sent fans streaming for the exits. The munitions included tear gas, flash bangs and flares.Many fans were either trampled to death or fatally crushed against walls and metal gates because some of the exits were closed, the investigation found. The Indonesian National Police did not respond to repeated requests for comment.The review — based on an examination of more than 100 videos and photographs, interviews with 11 witnesses and analyses by crowd control experts and civil rights advocates — reveals how the police’s use of tear gas in response to several hundred fans entering the field caused a huge surge at the southern end of Kanjuruhan stadium, where survivors say the bulk of the deaths occurred. Several doors were locked, witnesses said, further fueling the panic. This was confirmed by the country’s president, who has ordered a safety review of stadiums in the country.AdvertisementAs of Thursday, officials said 131 people had died, including 40 children. Human rights groups, including Amnesty International Indonesia, say the toll in Indonesia’s Malang regency could be as high as 200.The Indonesian government has called for an inquiry into the incident, which is among the deadliest crowd disasters ever recorded. Provincial police officials have said their use of tear gas was warranted because “there was anarchy,” but crowd control experts who reviewed a video reconstruction provided by The Post disagreed.The chief of Malang’s police department and nine other officers were dismissed Wednesday for their role in the disaster. Another 18 officers are also under investigation.The police response violated the Football Association of Indonesia’s protocols, which state that all matches have to abide by security provisions laid out by FIFA, soccer’s global governing body. FIFA bars “crowd control gas” from being used inside stadiums and mandates that exit gates and emergency exits remain unobstructed at all times.AdvertisementVideos provided exclusively to The Post show that police, shortly after the game ended, fired at least 40 nonlethal munitions at fans either on the field or in the stands. Much of the gas drifted toward seating sections, or “tribunes,” 11, 12 and 13.

Police standing in front of section 13 fired tear gas onto the field and upward into the stands, prompting thousands of spectators to evacuate their seats, videos show. Bottlenecks formed at the exits, which were only wide enough for one or two people to pass at a time, eyewitnesses said.Clifford Stott, a professor at Keele University in Britain who studies the policing of sports fans, reviewed videos provided by The Post and said that what happened at Kanjuruhan was a direct result of police action combined with poor stadium management. Along with another crowd control expert and four civil rights advocates, he said the police use of tear gas was disproportionate.Advertisement“To fire tear gas into the stands when the gates are locked is likely to lead to nothing else other than the massive amounts of fatalities,” he said. “And that’s exactly what’s occurred.”At 9:39 p.m. on Saturday, the referee blew the final whistle in the game between Arema FC and Persebaya Surabaya, rival teams in East Java province. The vast majority of spectators were fans of Arema FC, the home team, which had lost to Persebaya for the first time in 23 years. As Arema players began to leave the field, a few supporters hopped the barrier to approach them.Fans, some angry about their team losing the game, ran onto the soccer pitch and surrounded the goalkeeper after the match ended. (Video: Source: Ahmad Hendra/RCBFM radio)By about 9:45 p.m., several hundred spectators were on the field.Two minutes after the players were escorted off the field, security personnel guarding the exit began pushing back the crowd, scattering the fans. Tensions rapidly escalated.Officers at a soccer game in Indonesia where more than 100 people died on Oct. 1 chased crowds of fans on the pitch and hit them with batons. (Video: Left: Ahmad Hendra/RCBFM radio, Right: Twitter)Officers in military fatigues started to push fans back toward sections 11, 12 and 13, kicking them and striking them with batons and riot shields. Some spectators fell as they tried to clamber over metal barriers and back into the stands.AdvertisementAt about 9:50 p.m., police escalated to tear gas and flash bangs. Smoke caused by flares and gas drifted toward the southern seating sections, videos show.Spectators in sections 9 and 10 told The Post they coughed and their eyes started tearing almost immediately. In sections 12 and 13, rows of people were almost entirely blanketed by chemicals. Cries from tribune 13 echoed through the stands, witnesses said.“The gas burned,” recalled Elmiati, 33. She was seated near the exit in section 13 with her husband and 3-year-old son but was separated from them during the chaos. Both of them died of injuries later that night.“They kept firing into the tribunes … but the people there had no idea what was happening,” said Elmiati, who like many Indonesians only goes by one name. “We weren’t the ones who had run onto the field.”Fans desperately tried to exit a soccer stadium in Indonesia where more than 100 people died on Oct. 1. (Video: Source: Left: Youtube, Middle: Youtube, Right: Newsflare)As gas and smoke wafted through sections 12 and 13, many spectators jumped back onto the field to escape it, according to 10 witnesses interviewed by The Post. Others who tried to leave found the exits blocked, prompting them to jump onto the field, too, in search of another way out.AdvertisementOfficers then fired more tear gas toward the southern end of the stadium, some directly into the stands.Smoke covered stands on the south side of the soccer stadium in Indonesia where more than 100 people died on Oct. 1.

The supporters panicked because they wanted to get out, and the security forces also panicked,” said Ari Bowo Sucipto, a local photographer on the scene. “Both sides panicked … and it became a cycle.”Ranto Sibarani, a human rights lawyer in Medan, Indonesia, who reviewed video footage, said authorities appeared to be firing nonlethal munitions “sporadically” and without a clear strategy. There were local, national and military forces on the pitch, and it wasn’t clear who was in charge. The result was a massive, uncoordinated use of chemicals, Sibarani said.Officers deployed nonlethal munitions toward fans at a soccer stadium in Indonesia, where more than 100 people died on Oct. 1. (Video: Ahmad Hendra/RCBFM radio)Wirya Adiwena, deputy director for Amnesty International Indonesia, said police actions reflected a systemic problem in Indonesian law enforcement. An Amnesty report in 2020 documented 43 incidents of police violence during protests, including videos that show officers using tear gas in narrow spaces and firing water cannons at close range.Advertisement“This is not just the responsibility of the people who are swinging the batons,” he said, “but also of the people who have allowed a procedure like this to be implemented time and time again.”

Mohammed Iqbal, a 17-year-old who was seated close to Elmiati in section 13, said he ran when tear gas hit. He headed toward the exit at section 8, but it appeared closed. He returned to section 13, where he slipped and fell down stairs leading to the exit. Curled up on the ground, he suffered injuries to his arms, legs and stomach.“I was ready to die there,” said Iqbal, a food vendor. “I thought for certain I’d never make it out.”Dedi Prasetyo, spokesman for the national police force, said managing the exits was the responsibility of the game organizers, not the police.The Football Association of Indonesia acknowledged Tuesday that some of the exits were closed when police began firing tear gas, but it did not say how many. Stadium workers had not had time to reopen all the gates, said Erwin Tobing, a representative of the association.AdvertisementBut crowd control experts note that by the time police started firing tear gas, the game had been over for about 11 minutes.Police investigators, citing their review of surveillance video of six of the 14 gates in the stadium, said Tuesday that the doors were open but too narrow to handle the mass of people exiting.Photos and videos show some doors around the stadium were bent and warped after the incident.“I’ve seen video footage of heavy steel gates that have been bent by the pressure. Well, they can only have been bent by the pressure if they were locked shut,” Stott said. The exits that were open were obstructed in some places by people who had fainted or tripped, witnesses said.Bhaitul Rohman, 27, said he left through the exit in section 3 before going to section 4 to help others who were stuck.“I saw about 20 people just piled up on top of one another,” he said. “I felt a hand holding my leg and saw a man who couldn’t get out from under the pile of bodies.”Adi Renaldi in Malang, Indonesia, and Winda Charmila in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, contributed to this report.",Rebecca Tan,How police action in Indonesia led to a deadly crush in the soccer stadium
45,"TOKYO — North Korea on Thursday condemned military drills by the United States and its allies in the region as a “serious threat to the stability” of the Korean Peninsula, suggesting its latest missile launches were in response to the exercises.Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine.ArrowRightSpeaking for the first time since the country began its most recent round of weapons tests late last month, the North Korean Foreign Ministry denounced the United States for “unwarrantedly” referring Pyongyang’s ballistic missile launches to the United Nations Security Council. It defended its actions as “just counteraction measures” against the exercises.The United States, South Korea and Japan since August have been conducting military maneuvers to demonstrate their readiness to work together in the event of a conflict with the North. While the allies say the drills are defensive in nature, Kim Jong Un’s regime has long viewed them as hostile acts and used them to justify its weapons development and nuclear program.North Korea is turning up the heat again. Here’s why.“North Korea’s consistent and persistent claims that its missile launches are in response to joint U.S.-R.O.K. drills is part of North Korea’s long running strategy of establishing equivalence between their illicit provocations and U.S.-R.O.K. joint military exercises,” said Go Myong-hyun, a senior fellow at the Asan Institute of Policy Studies in Seoul, using an abbreviation for South Korea’s official name, the Republic of Korea.AdvertisementGo added that the North Korean Foreign Ministry’s statement Thursday “echoes precisely the talking points intended to inculcate the perception that the drills and provocations are equivalent, when in fact they are not.”Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said North Korea’s missile launches “absolutely cannot be tolerated.”“This is the sixth time in the short period, just counting the ones from the end of September,” Kishida said Thursday.He escaped North Korea, then risked everything to go back for his momChina’s Ambassador to the U.N., Geng Shuang, told the Security Council on Wednesday evening local time that North Korea’s tests “did not exist in isolation” but were rather a response to U.S. military activity in the region.The U.N. response should not merely be about pressuring Pyongyang, Geng said, adding that U.S. deployment of military assets was to blame for “creating tension” and the idea that North Korea’s launches were because of Security Council inaction was “totally incorrect.”AdvertisementThere has been a flurry of activity this week between the allies’ drills and North Korean ballistic missile tests, which violate U.N. Security Council resolutions. The reciprocal actions point to rising tensions as the United States, South Korea and Japan work more closely together to guard against North Korea’s nuclear and weapons development.With a new South Korean conservative president who is taking a harder line toward the North, U.S. and South Korean militaries resumed drills this summer for the first time in five years.North Korea codifies right to launch preemptive nuclear strikesNorth Korea’s recent rounds of tests began on Sept. 24 as the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan arrived in South Korea to participate in the exercises.On Tuesday, as drills involving the American carrier wrapped up, North Korea test-fired an intermediate-range missile over Japan for the first time since 2017. In response, the United States, South Korea and Japan conducted air, sea and land drills, including rare missile exercises by the U.S. and South Korean militaries and deploying the Reagan back out to the waters east of North Korea.On Thursday, North Korea test-fired two short-range ballistic missiles into the sea off its east coast. In its statement, North Korea said it is watching U.S. actions in the region, specifically the repositioning of the aircraft carrier.Julia Mio Inuma in Tokyo and Christian Shepherd in Taipei, Taiwan, contributed to this report.",Michelle Ye Hee Lee,"North Korea defends missile tests, slams U.S. over military exercises"
46,"The Biden administration is having “ongoing conversations” with the Cuban government on “the humanitarian needs of the Cuban people” in the wake of the devastation on the island caused by Hurricane Ian, a senior State Department official said Wednesday.Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine.ArrowRightThe talks follow a rare request for emergency aid last week from the Havana government after Cuba suffered an islandwide loss of electricity, floods and extensive damage after its western third took a direct hit from Ian as it made its way toward Florida.Neither side has specified what kind of aid is being discussed. The State Department official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive diplomatic efforts.But the talks mark a new stage in sporadic efforts to communicate following President Donald Trump’s rollback of the normalization of ties that began in 2015, when Barack Obama renewed U.S. diplomatic relations with Havana’s communist government more than five decades after they were severed.AdvertisementPresident Biden campaigned on a pledge to relax the renewed sanctions and isolation of Cuba imposed by Trump, who also reinstated Cuba’s U.S. designation as a state sponsor of terrorism.Biden’s administration has made only minor adjustments to the relationship, however, including allowing increases in the number of commercial U.S. flights to the island, loosening restrictions on sending remittances to family members by Cuban Americans, and permitting certain categories of U.S. citizen to travel there. Recently, the administration reversed an earlier refusal to issue a Treasury Department license to a Maryland-based producer of electric scooters and bicycles to privately owned companies in Cuba. The license was granted under an exception to existing trade restrictions for reasons relating to environmental quality.Cuba’s appeal for humanitarian assistance comes as the island — even before the storm and a deadly fire that struck a large Cuban oil storage facility in August — has struggled with a major economic crisis, including shortages of food and fuel. Last week brought the first significant street protests, in the capital and other cities, since major anti-government demonstrations were put down with a violent security response in July 2021.AdvertisementLast week’s protests appeared in large part to be a response to the islandwide blackout and general economic strife, although chants of “freedom” were also heard. The demonstrations have reportedly died down as power has been restored to some areas, although frequent blackouts continue to occur. There are also sporadic cuts to internet service, variously blamed by Cubans on the electricity problem and possible government intervention.Physical proximity, with only 90 miles separating the two countries, has meant that any hurricane affecting Cuba is likely also to take aim at the United States. Havana has rebuffed U.S. offers of assistance following previous major storms. In 2005, the United States rejected a Cuban offer to send physicians to New Orleans to assist in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.The Biden administration offered unspecified technical assistance following an August fire sparked by lightning at a fuel storage facility in the city of Matanzas, east of Havana. The massive blaze continued for days and added to overall fuel shortages on the island. The Cuban government said it was grateful but did not follow up on the offer beyond the reported acceptance of some firefighting equipment.AdvertisementThe two government have also held talks related to the record number of Cubans seeking admission to the United States across the Mexican border. In April, according to unpublished U.S. Customs and Border Protection figures obtained by The Washington Post, CBP was on pace to apprehend more than 155,000 Cubans during the current fiscal year, nearly four times the 2021 total and a twelvefold increase over 2020.",Karen DeYoung,U.S. weighs aid to Cuba following hurricane and request from Havana
47,"Kent Carter, a prominent racial-justice leader in Northern Virginia, was one of three people killed over the weekend in the Turks and Caicos Islands amid a string of violent attacks that have shaken this British territory in the Caribbean.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightCarter and his girlfriend had traveled to the popular vacation destination to celebrate his 40th birthday, his half brother Barry Cantrell said, and were being shuttled back to their hotel from a water-skiing excursion before the attack.Trevor Botting, the territory’s police commissioner, said that at around 6 p.m. Oct. 2, a group of “armed criminals” apprehended a vehicle containing staff from a local business and two tourists.The assailants “proceeded to indiscriminately shoot into the vehicle,” he said, killing one local employee and one tourist from the United States and injuring three others in the vehicle. They did not name any of the victims.AdvertisementCarter’s girlfriend survived with minor injuries, according to Cantrell. Officials said they believe one of the attackers was later killed by police.Botting said Monday that the ambush was “carried out by armed gang members who act without conscience, who have no regard for life, and who are hellbent on causing indiscriminate harm and misery.”Botting connected the incident to several other episodes involving armed attackers over the weekend, noting that violence has been on the rise on the Caribbean archipelago. In addition to the three deaths, five people were injured in this string of incidents.Julius D. “J.D.” Spain Sr., president of the Arlington NAACP, described Carter — an Army veteran and realtor who had been serving as the group’s first vice president — as a “gentle giant.”“He was a servant leader,” Spain said. “He was one who didn’t ask for anything in return, but did it because he knew it had to be done.”AdvertisementA high school football player who grew up near Knoxville, Tenn., Carter served as a military policeman at Fort Bragg in North Carolina. Even while deployed in Afghanistan, he would proudly wear orange gear to support the University of Tennessee football team, his half brother said.“No matter where he went, East Tennessee always stuck with him,” Cantrell added. “We both had kind of a rough background … but look at how he turned out. Anything he touched, he was very good at.”Carter moved to the D.C. area after leaving the Army and worked as a special agent for the U.S. Air Force and the Department of Commerce before making a career shift to sell real estate.Spain said he first met Carter through the Prince Hall Freesmasonry, a historically all-Black Masonic association that conducts charitable work such as food drives. Carter would go on to lead Alexandria’s Universal Lodge No. 1, the association’s oldest branch.Advertisement“His impact in our community and his character and trustworthiness and judgment were impeccable,” Spain said. “He’s one of those silent but very effective leaders. … No one can speak ill will of Kent. He was just a very warmhearted individual.”Carter, who also chaired the Arlington NAACP’s criminal justice committee, helped organize a large racial-justice protest in the Court House neighborhood following the police killing of George Floyd in summer 2020.Weeks later, he was appointed to the county’s police practices working group, which was tasked with reviewing policies for law enforcement in Arlington. Carter worked on a subcommittee of the group that helped design recommendations for the county’s new civilian oversight board.The office of Turks and Caicos Premier Washington Misick wrote in a statement Tuesday that the incident on Turks and Caicos over the weekend “is rare and does not reflect who we are as a people.”AdvertisementThe attack, the statement said, was “not one in which the victim was targeted.”Botting said police and the attackers exchanged fire in a separate encounter later that weekend.After officers in a patrol car intercepted the assailants’ vehicle, the attackers began shooting automatic weapons toward the officers. Their bullets repeatedly struck the windshield and deflated two tires on the patrol car.Officials said they are investigating reports about an unidentified body found nearby, which they believe was one of the armed attackers shot by police. They said they also believe shots discharged by the attackers during the confrontation with police struck a different man, who had arrived at a hospital with a head injury.Cantrell, who received a call from Carter’s girlfriend as soon as she got back to her hotel, said he is still processing the news about his half brother. A fellow sports lover, he had recently spent a weekend in Atlanta with his half brother watching baseball and visiting the College Football Hall of Fame.“To be honest, it has still not registered,” he said. “You just don’t want to believe it.”",Teo Armus,Arlington civil rights leader killed in Turks and Caicos shooting
48,"MYKOLAIV REGION, Ukraine — The drone operator ignored the occasional thunder of outgoing artillery in the distance and kept his eyes focused on the computer monitor in front of him, waiting for the burst of smoke to appear. His thumbs pushed the joystick left, then right, before moving to his cellphone screen to report where the artillery should aim next.Some three miles from Ukraine’s southern front line, U.S.-provided M777 howitzers were pounding the Russian forces who were refusing to yield any more ground.Another soldier, whose call sign is “Dobriy,” then informed his comrades in this Ukrainian special forces unit that their drone wasn’t the only one in the sky. He had just been told that a Russian Orlan reconnaissance UAV was headed this way, and if they were spotted, shelling would surely follow. The day before, the field behind this short trench line was littered with rockets. “That was especially for me,” Dobriy said with a grin.His commander, Col. Roman Kostenko, now looked concerned. “Should we leave?” he asked, referring to himself and The Washington Post journalists he brought with him. “Too late,” answered Arthur, the drone operator, still not taking his eyes off the screen in front of him.A day after Ukrainian forces reclaimed more territory in the southern Kherson and Mykolaiv regions, the jubilation of a breakthrough at this part of the front line was tempered by anxiety over an expected hard fight ahead.Kyiv’s military here has pushed the Russians back by dozens of miles in some spots after struggling to advance for months. But after Ukraine’s remarkably successful counteroffensive in the northeast Kharkiv region, soldiers stationed near the southern front cautioned that the situation remains tense. Kherson is too important, politically and militarily, for the Russians to retreat as messily as in Kharkiv, they said.“This is not Kharkiv,” Kostenko said. “There, they left all of their ammunition and vehicles and fled. Here, we don’t even have many trophies. They just retreated from the fight, took everything with them to their new position and are digging in anew.”AdvertisementWhat the Ukrainians have observed is an orderly Russian pullback from some towns and villages in what could be preparation to tighten the front line around the city of Kherson, the lone regional capital Moscow’s forces have captured since their invasion began last February, and the neighboring town of Nova Kakhovka. It’s home to a hydroelectric power plant that also controls a vital water supply to Crimea, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014. Seizing the plant and restoring the water flow, which Ukraine had cut off, was one of Russia’ top military objectives in the early days of the invasion.Putin cites success in annexed regions even as his exhausted troops retreatThe Ukrainian advances come as the Russian force finds itself in an increasingly precarious position in and around Kherson. The city is situated on the only slice of territory the Russian military controls west of the Dnieper River. The land is flat, making it particularly difficult for Russia to defend.The slice of occupied land is connected to the rest of Russian-controlled territory by two main crossings over the Dnieper — the Antonovsky Bridge in Kherson, which is badly damaged, and the Kakhovka hydroelectric dam, which is about 45 miles to the east and remains passable.Russian forces risk getting cut off in Kherson — surrounded by Ukrainian forces on three sides and the river on the fourth — if the Ukrainians manage to advance close enough to the river to make it impassable.“If the Ukrainian military is able to get artillery within range of the main bridges and river crossings, then the Russian position in general may become untenable,” said Michael Kofman, a military analyst at Virginia-based research group CNA.AdvertisementCautious military strategy would call for retreating over the river rather than bearing the risk of getting surrounded or besieged in Kherson. But the Russians are likely to fight to hold Kherson because it is the capital of a region that President Vladimir Putin claims to have annexed.‘I refuse to comply,’ says Russian journalist, days after escaping house arrestThe city and its environs would also serve as a helpful bridgehead on the western side of the river for the Russians, should they manage to reconstitute their combat power and go on the offensive seeking to capture the port cities of Mykolaiv and Odessa.“We think it unlikely the Russian leadership would sanction a full pullout from Kherson for political reasons,” said a Western official who insisted on anonymity to brief reporters about sensitive security information. “So this situation in the south could become increasingly messy with, potentially, a more desperate Russian force with backs to the river.”“It won’t be an easy rush through unconstrained territory,” the official added. “They will have a challenge there.”So far, the Ukrainians have made the most progress pushing the Russians back northeast of Kherson. How fast the Russian front might collapse depends on whether the Russians have set up echelon defenses to fall back on between the front and the city.Unlike in Kharkiv, where local militiamen and Russian national guardsmen were primarily manning a front that fell quickly, Russia has put more seasoned forces — paratroopers and marines — in and around Kherson. They are tougher adversaries, but even those units now seem disjointed due to heavy casualties.Capt. Andriy Pidlisnyy said his Ukrainian military unit in the Mykolaiv region recently captured a Russian prisoner who explained Moscow’s manpower problems like this: In the prisoner’s three-man tank crew, all three were from different units within Russia’s forces.The prisoner, a paratrooper, was the driver. The commander, was a mercenary from the Wagner paramilitary outfit. And the gunner was mobilized from the occupied Luhansk region, which is under the control of Kremlin proxies.“If even at the tank level they have such a hodgepodge from different units, then at the level where there is a company, battalion and brigade, it’s clear that there can be no normal coordination,” Pidlisnyy said.Ukraine is now looking to take advantage of a key transition period for Russia, before the reinforcements from Putin’s recent mobilization arrive at the front. Near the recently liberated settlement of Davydiv Brid, there was a flurry of activity on the road Wednesday as Ukrainian forces moved pontoon bridges, self-propelled howitzers, and armored vehicles. Kostenko’s drone unit prepared homemade explosives in recycled soda cans to drop on fields around Davydiv Brid — an inventive demining tactic.The Ukrainian counteroffensive, pressing on two fronts, is now moving so fast that even soldiers on the ground have trouble keeping up.“Is Snihurivka ours already?” Kostenko asked his deputy, referring to a town in the Mykolaiv region that has been a stronghold for Russian forces since the early days of the war.“Almost,” Maj.

And while he doesn’t expect it to be easy, the recent gains have convinced all of Ukraine that it is possible.“The success of the counteroffensive in Kharkiv really motivated fighters here,” Kostenko said. “The instinct is to be cautious, but sometimes you have to shove your foot in there to see it’s not that scary and you can go further.

49,"NAIROBI, Kenya — Food security, consumer rights and biodiversity groups are protesting Kenya’s reversal of a ban on genetically modified foods, saying the public wasn’t consulted on an issue key to the East African country’s economy and safety.Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine.ArrowRightKenya’s new President William Ruto earlier this week announced that the Cabinet had effectively lifted the decade-old ban on openly cultivating and importing genetically modified crops. The decision came after pressure by the United States government, which had argued that the ban affected U.S. agricultural exports and food aid.In a joint statement on Thursday, the groups including the Kenya-based Consumer Grassroots Association, Route to Food, Greenpeace Africa and the African Biodiversity Network said the abrupt decision “essentially curtails the freedom of Kenyans to choose what they want to eat.” They called for the ban to be reinstated immediately and for an “inclusive participatory process” to look into food security issues.AdvertisementRuto took office last month promising a transparent government, the statement said. It also argued that the introduction of genetically modified organisms hurts the growing organic export market and creates an unfair situation for Kenyan farmers, 80% of whom are farming on a small scale.Agriculture is a main driver of Kenya’s economy and about 70% of the rural workforce is in farming. Ruto, a former agriculture minister, seeks greater agricultural productivity.“GMOs will put at risk our indigenous seed and plant varieties,” the statement said, adding that the National Biosafety Authority that’s meant to regulate GMOs lacks the capacity to take on this expansion. Kenya’s Cabinet in 2019 made a limited step by approving the commercialization of a genetically enhanced variety of cotton to resist the African bollworm pest.AdvertisementMany African countries have bans on genetically modified agriculture, amid concerns about potentially harmful effects on smallholder farms, existing crops, the environment and people’s long-term health.Following Kenya’s decision, neighboring Tanzania’s agriculture minister told local newspaper The Citizen that “we will put in place extra measures so as to make sure there aren’t any GM-related seeds that enter the country.”A spokesman for Kenya’s president didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday’s statement.",Cara Anna | AP,"Food security, consumer groups protest Kenya's GMO decision"
50,"STOCKHOLM — French author Annie Ernaux, who has fearlessly mined her experiences as a working-class woman to explore life in France since the 1940s, won this year’s Nobel Prize in literature Thursday for work that illuminates the murky corners of memory, family and society.Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine.ArrowRightErnaux ‘s books probe deeply personal experiences and feelings – love, sex, abortion, shame – within a society split by gender and class divisions. The Swedish Academy said Ernaux, 82, was recognized for “the courage and clinical acuity” of books rooted in her small-town background in the Normandy region of northwest France.Anders Olsson, chairman of the Nobel literature committee, said Ernaux is “an extremely honest writer who is not afraid to confront the hard truths.”“She writes about things that no one else writes about, for instance her abortion, her jealousy, her experiences as an abandoned lover and so forth. I mean, really hard experiences,” he told The Associated Press after the award announcement in Stockholm. “And she gives words for these experiences that are very simple and striking. They are short books, but they are really moving.”AdvertisementOne of France’s most-garlanded authors and a prominent feminist voice, Ernaux said she was happy to have won the prize, which carries a cash award of 10 million Swedish kronor (nearly $900,000) — but “not bowled over.”“I am very happy, I am proud. Voila, that’s all,” Ernaux told journalists outside her home in Cergy, a working-class town west of Paris that she has written about.French President Emmanuel Macron tweeted: “Annie Ernaux has been writing for 50 years the novel of the collective and intimate memory of our country. Her voice is that of women’s freedom, and the century’s forgotten ones.”While Macron praised Ernaux for her Nobel, she has been unsparing with him. A supporter of left-wing causes for social justice, she has poured scorn on Macron’s background in banking and said his first term as president failed to advance the cause of French women.AdvertisementErnaux is the first female French Nobel literature winner and just the 17th woman among the 119 Nobel literature laureates. More than a dozen French writers have captured the literature prize since Sully Prudhomme won the inaugural award in 1901. The most recent French winner before Ernaux was Patrick Modiano in 2014.Her more than 20 books, most of them very short, chronicle events in her life and the lives of those around her. They present uncompromising portraits of sexual encounters, abortion, illness and the deaths of her parents.Olsson said Ernaux’s work was often “written in plain language, scraped clean.” He said she had used the term “an ethnologist of herself” rather than a writer of fiction.Ernaux worked as a teacher before becoming a full-time writer. Her first book was “Les armoires vides” in 1974 (published in English as “Cleaned Out”). Two more autobiographical novels followed – “Ce qu’ils disent ou rien” (“What They Say Goes”) and “La femme gelée” (“The Frozen Woman”) – before she moved to more overtly autobiographical books.AdvertisementIn the book that made her name, “La place” (“A Man’s Place”), published in 1983 and about her relationship with her father, she wrote: “No lyrical reminiscences, no triumphant displays of irony. This neutral writing style comes to me naturally.”“La honte” (“Shame”), published in 1997, explored a childhood trauma, while “L’événement” (“Happening”), from 2000 dealt with an illegal abortion.Her most critically acclaimed book is “Les années” (“The Years”), published in 2008, which described herself and wider French society from the end of World War II to the 21st century. Unlike in previous books, in “The Years,” Ernaux wrote in the third person, calling her character “she” rather than “I.” The book received numerous awards and honors, and Olsson said it has been called “the first collective autobiography.”Advertisement“Mémoire de fille” (“A Girl’s Story”), from 2016, follows a young woman’s coming of age in the 1950s, while “Passion Simple” (“Simple Passion”) and “Se perdre” (“Getting Lost”) chart Ernaux’s intense affair with a Russian diplomat.Ernaux told the newspaper Liberation that “Simple Passion” had “brought me a lot of enemies” and riled “the bourgeoisie.” She said she had faced scorn from France’s literary establishment because “I was a woman who didn’t come from their background.”The literature prize has long faced criticism that it is too focused on European and North American writers, as well as too male-dominated. Last year’s prize winner, Tanzanian-born, U.K.-based writer Abdulrazak Gurnah, was only the sixth Nobel literature laureate born in Africa.Olsson said the academy was working to diversify its range, drawing on experts in literature from different regions and languages.Advertisement“We try to broaden the concept of literature but it is the quality that counts, ultimately,” he said.A week of Nobel Prize announcements kicked off Monday with Swedish scientist Svante Paabo receiving the award in medicine for unlocking secrets of Neanderthal DNA that provided key insights into our immune system.Frenchman Alain Aspect, American John F. Clauser and Austrian Anton Zeilinger won the physics prize on Tuesday for work showing that tiny particles can retain a connection with each other even when separated, a phenomenon known as quantum entanglement.The Nobel Prize in chemistry was awarded Wednesday to Americans Carolyn R. Bertozzi and K. Barry Sharpless, and Danish scientist Morten Meldal for developing a way of “snapping molecules together” that can be used to explore cells, map DNA and design drugs to target cancer and other diseases.AdvertisementThe 2022 Nobel Peace Prize will be announced on Friday and the economics award on Monday.The prizes will be handed out on Dec. 10.

51,"BANGKOK — A former policeman facing a drug charge burst into a day care center in northeastern Thailand on Thursday, killing dozens of preschoolers and teachers before shooting more people as he fled in the deadliest rampage in the nation’s history.Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine.ArrowRightThe assailant, who was fired from the force earlier this year, took his own life after killing his wife and child at home.A witness said staff at the day care locked the door when they saw the assailant approaching with a gun, but he shot his way in. At least 37 people were killed in the attack in one of the poorest parts of Thailand, according to police spokesman Archayon Kraithong.“The teacher who died, she had a child in her arms,” the witness, whose name wasn’t given, told Thailand’s Kom Chad Luek television. “I didn’t think he would kill children, but he shot at the door and shot right through it.”AdvertisementA video taken by a first responder arriving at the scene of the single-story day care in the rural town of Nongbua Lamphu showed rescuers rushing in to the building past the shattered glass front door, with drops of blood visible on the ground.In footage posted online after the attack, frantic family members could be heard weeping outside the building, and one image showed the floor of a room smeared with blood where sleeping mats were scattered. Pictures of the alphabet and other colorful decorations adorned the walls.Police identified the suspect as 34-year-old former police officer Panya Kamrap. Police Maj. Gen. Paisal Luesomboon told PPTV in an interview that he was fired from the force earlier this year because of the drug charge.In a Facebook posting, Thai police chief Gen. Dumrongsak Kittiprapas said the man, who had been a sergeant, was due in court on Friday for a hearing in the case involving methamphetamine possession, and speculated that he may have chosen the day care because it was close to his home.AdvertisementEarlier, Dumrongsak told reporters that the main weapon used was a 9mm pistol that the man had purchased himself. Paisal said he also had a shotgun and a knife.Thailand’s Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha, who plans to travel to the scene on Friday, told reporters that initial reports were that the former officer was having personal problems.“This shouldn’t happen,” he said. “I feel deep sadness toward the victims and their relatives.”Police have not given a full breakdown of the death toll, but they have said at least 22 children and two adults were killed at the day care. At least two more children were killed elsewhere. They said 12 people were wounded.Firearm-related deaths in Thailand are much lower than in countries like the United States and Brazil, but higher than in countries like Japan and Singapore that have strict gun control laws. The rate of firearms related deaths in 2019 was about 4 per 100,000, compared with about 11 per 100,000 in the U.S. and nearly 23 per 100,000 in Brazil.AdvertisementMass shootings are rare but not unheard of in Thailand, which has one of the highest civilian gun ownership rates in Asia, with 15.1 weapons per 100 population compared to only 0.3 in Singapore and 0.25 in Japan. That’s still far lower than the U.S. rate of 120.5 per 100 people, according to a 2017 survey by Australia’s GunPolicy.org nonprofit organization.The country’s previous worst mass shooting involved a disgruntled soldier who opened fire in and around a mall in the northeastern city of Nakhon Ratchasima in 2020, killing 29 people and holding off security forces for some 16 hours before eventually being killed by them.Last month, a clerk shot co-workers at Thailand’s Army War College in Bangkok, killing two and wounding another before he was arrested.___This story has been updated to correct the spelling of a Thai TV station.

52,"MEXICO CITY — A drug gang shot to death 20 people, including a mayor and his father, in the mountains of southern Mexico, officials said Thursday.A video posted on social media showed men who identified themselves as the Tequileros gang claiming responsibility for the mass shooting in the state of Guerrero.Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine.ArrowRightThe Guerrero state security council said gunmen burst into the town hall in the village of San Miguel Totolapan Wednesday and opened fire on a meeting the mayor was holding with other officials.Among the dead were Mayor Conrado Mendoza and his father, Juan Mendoza Acosta, a former mayor of the town. Most of the other victims were believed to be local officials.The walls of the town hall, which were surrounded by children’s fair rides at the time, were left riddled with bullets. Totolapan is geographically large but sparsely populated mountainous township in a region known as Tierra Caliente, one of Mexico’s most conflict-ridden areas.AdvertisementRicardo Mejia, Mexico’s assistant secretary of public safety, said the Tequileros are fighting the Familia Michoacana gang in the region and that the authenticity of the video was being verified.“This act occurred in the context of a dispute between criminal gangs,” Mejia said. “A group known as the Tequileros dominated the region for some time; it was a group that mainly smuggled and distributed opium, but also engaged in kidnapping, extortion and several killings in the region.”Totolapan was controlled for years by drug gang boss Raybel Jacobo de Almonte, known by his nickname as “El Tequilero,” “The Tequila Drinker.”In his only known public appearance, de Alamonte was captured on video drinking with the elder Mendoza, who was then the town’s mayor-elect, in 2015. It was not clear if the elder Mendoza was there of his own free will, or had been forced to attend the meeting.AdvertisementIn that video, de Alamonte appeared so drunk he mumbled inaudibly and had to be held up in a sitting position by one of his henchmen.In 2016, Totolapan locals got so fed up with abductions by the Tequileros that they kidnapped the gang leader’s mother to leverage the release of others.While the Tequileros long depended on trafficking opium paste from local poppy growers, the growing use of the synthetic opioid fentanyl had reduced the demand for opium paste and lowered the level of violence in Guerrero.Also Wednesday, in the neighboring state of Morelos, a state lawmaker was shot to death in the city of Cuernavaca, south of Mexico City.Two armed men traveling on a motorcycle fatally shot state Deputy Gabriela Marín as she exited a vehicle outside a pharmacy. A person with Marín was reportedly wounded in the attack.Advertisement“Based on the information we have, we cannot rule out a motive related to politics,” Mejia said of that killing. “The deceased, Gabriela Marín, had just taken office as a legislator in July, after another member of the legislature died, and there were several legal disputes concerning the seat.”The killing of Mendoza brought to 18 the number of mayors slain during the administration of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, and the number of state lawmakers to eight, according to data from Etellekt Consultores.Mexico’s Congress this week is debating the president’s proposal to extend the military’s policing duties to 2028. Last month, lawmakers approved López Obrador’s push to transfer the ostensibly civilian National Guard to military control.While attacks on public officials are not uncommon in Mexico, these come at a time when the López Obrador’s security strategy is being sharply debated. The president has placed tremendous responsibility in the armed forces rather than civilian police for reining in Mexico’s persistently high levels of violence. He pledged to continue, saying “we have to go on doing the same things, because it has brought results.”AdvertisementLópez Obrador sought to blame previous administrations for Mexico’s persistent problem of violence.“These are (criminal) organizations that have been there for a long time, that didn’t spring up in this administration,” López Obrador said. He also blamed local people in the Tierra Caliente region for supporting the gangs — and sometimes even electing them to office.“There are still communities that protect these groups, and even vote them into office as authorities,” the president said.",Associated Press,Drug gang kills 20 in attack on city hall in southern Mexico

They said it could have led to endocarditis, or inflammation inside the heart, and to his death, aged 71, in Switzerland.The team was led by Prof. Michał Witt, head of the human genetics institute at the Polish Academy of Sciences in Poznan and Dr. Tadeusz Dobosz of the Wroclaw Medical University. They took the samples for their molecular tests from a vessel where the heart is being kept, at the Royal Castle in Warsaw.AdvertisementUnder some conditions, skin bacteria can attack the internal organs, including the heart, leading to very serious problems, Witt told Polish Radio Zet24.He stressed that it’s hard to say for sure what caused Kosciuszko’s death but that their findings have led them to the “rationally based hypothesis” that it was the acne bacteria that caused the documented rapid deterioration of his health and death.Previously, typhoid fever or pneumonia were believed to have ended Kosciuszko’s life. He was said to have developed a high fever and chills after he had fallen off his horse into a cold stream.Born in 1746 in the then-Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Kosciuszko fought as colonel of the Continental Army in the 1776 American Revolutionary War. A military engineer and architect, he designed and oversaw the construction of America’s fortifications, including West Point.Back to restless Poland, in 1794 he commanded an ill-fated uprising against the Russian Empire that was annexing some of Poland’s lands.

Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine.ArrowRightThe two strikes, the first before dawn and another in the morning, damaged more than 40 buildings, local authorities said. The attacks came just hours after Ukraine’s president announced that the country’s military had retaken three more villages in another of the four regions annexed by Russia, the latest battlefield reversal for Moscow.The Zaporizhzhia region’s governor, Oleksandr Starukh wrote on Telegram that many people were rescued from the multi-story buildings, including a 3-year-old girl who was taken to a hospital for treatment.AdvertisementPhotos provided by the Emergency Service of Ukraine showed rescuers scrambling through rubble in the wreckage of a building looking for survivors.Starukh said of Russia: “The terrorist country has shown its beastly face by converting defense weapons into offensive weapons and killing peacefully sleeping people.”Zaporizhzhia is one of the regions of Ukraine that Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed as Russian territory in violation of international laws and is home to a nuclear plant that is under Russian occupation. The city of the same name remains under Ukrainian control.The head of the U.N.’s atomic energy watchdog is expected to visit Kyiv this week to discuss the situation at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant after Putin signed a decree Wednesday declaring that Russia was taking over the six-reactor facility.AdvertisementUkraine’s Foreign Ministry called the move a criminal act and said it considered Putin’s decree “null and void.” The state nuclear operator, Energoatom, said it would continue to operate the plant.Rafael Grossi, the director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, plans to discuss efforts to set up a secure protection zone around the facility, which has been damaged during Russia’s war in Ukraine and seen staff, including its director, abducted by Russian troops.Grossi plans to travel to Moscow for talks with Russian officials after his stop in Ukraine.The U.S. government sent its international development chief to Kyiv on Thursday, the highest-ranking American official to visit Ukraine since Russia illegally annexed the four regions.The head of the U.S. Agency for International Development, Samantha Power, was holding meetings with government officials and residents. She said the U.S. would provide an additional $55 million to repair heating pipes and other equipment.AdvertisementUSAID said the United States had delivered $9.89 billion in aid to Ukraine since February.

It was not clear if that number included those killed in the morning strikes in Zaporizhzhia.In his nightly video address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the Ukrainian army recaptured three more villages in the Kherson region. Novovoskrysenske, Novohryhorivka, and Petropavlivka are all situated northeast of Kherson.Ukrainian forces are seizing back villages in Kherson in humiliating battlefield defeats for Russian forces that have badly dented the image of a powerful Russian military and added to the tensions surrounding an ill-planned mobilization. They have also fueled fighting among Kremlin insiders and left Putin increasingly cornered.AdvertisementOn Wednesday, the Ukrainian military said the Ukrainian flag was raised above seven Kherson region villages previously occupied by the Russians. The closest of the liberated villages to the city of Kherson is Davydiv Brid, some 100 kilometers (60 miles) away.Ukraine also was seeking to press a counteroffensive in the Donetsk region, which has been partly controlled by Moscow-backed separatists since 2014 yet remains contested despite Putin’s proclaimed annexation.When Russian troops pulled back from the Donetsk city of Lyman over the weekend, they retreated so rapidly that they left behind the bodies of their comrades. Some were still lying by the side of the road leading into the city on Wednesday.Lyman sustained heavy damage both during the occupation and as Ukrainian soldiers fought to retake it. Mykola, a 71-year-old man who gave only his first name, was among about 100 residents who lined up for aid on Wednesday.Advertisement“We want the war to come to an end, the pharmacy and shops and hospitals to start working as they used to,” he said. “Now we don’t have anything yet.

56,"GENEVA — In a close diplomatic victory for China, the U.N.’s top human rights body on Thursday voted down a proposal from Britain, Turkey, the United States and other mostly Western countries to hold a debate on alleged rights abuses against Muslim Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in China’s western Xinjiang region.Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine.ArrowRightAt the 47-member state Human Rights Council, 17 countries voted in favor, 19 were against, and 11 abstained in a vote to hold a debate on Xinjiang at its next session in March. The vote amounted to a test of political and diplomatic clout between the West and Beijing, and would have marked the first time that China’s record on human rights would merit a specific agenda item at the council.The result, prompting a smattering of applause in the chamber, followed days of diplomatic arm-twisting in Geneva and in many national capitals as leading Western countries tried to build momentum on a report from former U.N. human rights chief Michelle Bachelet’s office, released Aug. 31, which found that possible “crimes against humanity” had occurred in Xinjiang.AdvertisementA simple majority of voting countries was required.China locked down “no” votes among its usual allies, plus many African countries and Persian Gulf states Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. Somalia was the only African country, and only member state of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, to vote “yes.” Turkey is in the OIC, but doesn’t have a council seat right now. Argentina, Brazil, India, Malaysia, Mexico and Ukraine were among countries that abstained.The make-up of the council rotates among U.N. member states each year, and China — a powerful country with a permanent seat on the Security Council — has never been the subject of a country-specific resolution at the council since it was founded more than 16 years ago.“It’s always difficult for countries to vote against a permanent member of the Security Council,” said one Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. He acknowledged it was a “genuinely difficult call” for some countries — notably those with economic or political ties to China — to sign on to the measure.AdvertisementThe proposal was for just to hold a debate, with no consistent monitoring of the rights situation, and amounted just about the least intrusive form of scrutiny that the council could seek.The call stopped short of creating a team of investigators to look into possible crimes in Xinjiang, or appointing a special rapporteur — a tacit acknowledgement by the Western countries that going after increasingly influential China would be a tall order.Before the vote, Chinese ambassador Chen Xu said Beijing “firmly opposes and categorically rejects” the proposal. He accused Western countries of seeking to turn a “blind eye” to their own issues on human rights and point a finger at others. He insisted that China never gave its support to Bachelet’s report, and warned of a bad precedent.“Today China is targeted,” Chen said. “Tomorrow any other developing country could be targeted.”AdvertisementMichele Taylor, the U.S. ambassador, said the request for the debate aimed simply to “provide neutral forum for discussion” that would give China a chance to put its views on record and hear the views of others.“No country represented here today has a perfect human rights record,” she said. “No country, no matter how powerful, should be excluded from council discussions. This includes my country — the United States — and it includes the People’s Republic of China.”On Friday, as part of dozens of proposals before the council, member states are also to consider a proposal from 26 European Union countries to appoint a “special rapporteur” on Russia, citing a string of concerns about mass arrests and detentions; harassment of journalists, opposition politicians, activists and rights defenders; and crackdowns — at times violent — on protesters against President Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine.It’s part of a rare push against two permanent members of the Security Council: China and Russia. Some Western diplomats have insisted the two-pronged effort needed attention now.The council has already commissioned a team of investigators who are looking into human rights violations and abuses in Ukraine following Putin’s order for a military invasion of Ukraine in late February.",Jamey Keaten | AP,UN rights body rejects Western bid to debate Xinjiang abuses
57,"NAIROBI, Kenya — Babies in Ethiopia’s embattled Tigray region are dying in their first month of life at four times the rate before the war cut off access to most medical care for over 5 million people, according to the most sweeping study yet of how mothers and children are suffering.Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine.ArrowRightWomen are dying during pregnancy or within 42 days of giving birth at five times the rate before the war, and children under 5 are dying at twice the pre-war rate, often because of easily preventable reasons, according to the yet-unpublished study shared by its authors with The Associated Press.Almost two years have passed since the war started and Ethiopia’s government isolated the Tigray region from the rest of the world, severing basic services such as electricity, phone, internet and banking.While United Nations-backed investigators last month said all sides including the Tigray forces have committed abuses, they said the Ethiopian government is using “starvation of civilians” as a weapon of war. Tigray is “one of the worst manmade humanitarian crises in the world,” the European Union foreign policy chief said Thursday.AdvertisementThe warring sides have been invited to African Union-mediated peace talks this weekend in South Africa.A lull in the war earlier this year allowed thousands of trucks of humanitarian aid into Tigray, but renewed fighting in August has again stopped deliveries to a region where critical medical supplies like insulin and childhood vaccines have run out. There is an “extreme shortage” of medicines and equipment, the U.N.-backed investigators found.Pregnant women and young children, least to blame for the fighting, are among the most vulnerable. The new study was conducted in May and June by local health authorities with financial support from two U.N. agencies and studied more than 189,000 households in six of the region’s seven zones via cluster sampling. With limited fuel for transport, researchers at times walked for hours to reach rural areas.AdvertisementMaternal mortality was at 840 deaths per 100,000 live births, up from a low of 186 before the war, with obstetric hemorrhage and hypertension the most common causes. “This level is unacceptably high and is comparable to the level which was 22 years back,” the study says.More than 80% of mothers died outside a health facility, another stark contrast, the study says. More than 90% of mothers in Tigray before the war had prenatal care and more than 70% benefited from skilled delivery, according to an analysis published in the BMJ Global Health journal last year.The increase in maternal mortality in Tigray has been “phenomenal,” the U.N. Population Fund said this year.Neonatal mortality, or children dying in the first 28 days of life, was at 36 in 1,000 live births, the new study says. That’s a four-fold increase from pre-war levels, and more than half of the deaths occurred at home without medical intervention. The most common causes were prematurity, infections and perinatal asphyxia, or the inability to establish breathing at birth.AdvertisementUnder-5 mortality was 59 in 1,000 live births, double the rate before the war. “Vaccine-preventable diseases like diarrheal disease, pneumonia and pertussis account for the majority of causes,” the study says.In images shared this week with the AP from Tigray’s flagship hospital in the capital, Mekele, a health worker pinched the thin stomach of a small child, 2-year-old Selam Mulu. The skin stayed pinched after the hand was removed, a sign of dehydration in malnutrition.The study calls for more medical supplies including painkillers, antibiotics, anticonvulsants, vaccines, IV fluid and drugs to induce labor after fetal death.“For women here, it’s hell,” a gynecologist in Mekele who was part of the research team told the AP. He spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation.“They get pregnant, they cannot access care,” he said. “I’m talking about the rural women. And if she’s in labor and if she lives in the mountains, which is the case for most pregnant mothers in the outskirts, they cannot travel. They cannot call an ambulance. There is no money to pay for private transportation. Even if they arrive at a health facility, there is nothing.”AdvertisementBefore the war, a woman’s pregnancy was a joyous matter, the gynecologist said. Now it’s a bad omen, with people feeling sorry for her.“I haven’t heard of such things in other parts of the world,” he said.This occurs as the U.N.-backed investigators found that some Tigrayans are resorting to transactional sex to survive.It remains difficult to estimate the war’s death toll because of the widespread constraints, the gynecologist added. Thousands of people have died. Independent journalists have been barred from the region.The researchers plan to share their results with the international community and Ethiopia’s health minister, Lia Tadesse, who is also a gynecologist. The minister, told of the findings and asked for comment, didn’t reply to the AP.The war has devastated Tigray’s once well-funded health system, the gynecologist said. “People would ask you, ‘Are you going to help us? What’s after the data collection? Are you going to solve our problems?’ It was haunting.”",Cara Anna | AP,"Babies in Tigray dying at 4 times pre-war levels, study says"
58,"BANJUL, Gambia — Gambia has launched an urgent door-to-door campaign to remove cough and cold syrups blamed for the deaths of more than 60 children from kidney injury in the tiny West African country.Speaking to The Associated Press, the Director of Health Dr. Mustapha Bittaye confirmed the wave of child deaths from acute kidney injury, sending shockwaves across the country of 2.4 million people and around the world.Are you on Telegram?

The U.N. health agency said it is pursuing investigations with the company and regulatory authorities in India.“WHO recommends all countries detect and remove these products from circulation to prevent further harm to patients,” it said.Teaming up with the Gambia Red Cross Society, the Ministry of Health has dispatched hundreds of young people to collect the suspect syrups through a house-to-house campaign.Gambia’s Medical Research Council has also issued an alarm.“Over the last week, we admitted a child with this condition (acute kidney injury) ... and she has unfortunately died. We were able to confirm that she had taken one of the drugs that is suspected to be causing this, prior to her arrival at our clinic. It had been bought at a pharmacy within The Gambia,” the council said in a statement. “The drug has been identified as containing a significant amount of a toxin which damages kidneys irreversibly.”AdvertisementIn India, the federal regulator and the state regulator of northern Haryana state are conducting an inquiry into the contaminated medicines.Of the 23 samples tested, four had so far been found to be contaminated and India is waiting for the analysis to be shared with it, said an Indian health official who spoke on condition of anonymity since they were not authorized to speak to the media.Phone calls to the headquarters of Maiden Pharmaceuticals went unanswered. Neither India’s health ministry nor the federal regulator responded to queries from the AP.___AP journalists Jamey Keaten in Geneva and Aniruddha Ghosal in New Delhi, India, contributed.",Abdoulie John | AP,Gambia urgently recalls syrups blamed for 66 child deaths
