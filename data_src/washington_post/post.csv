1,"In a vain bid to celebrate his illegal annexation of Ukrainian territory, Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday congratulated educators on Teachers’ Day, and promised to organize new medical exams and restful autumn holidays for schoolchildren in “restless and even dangerous” areas of Ukraine. But even as he spoke, Russian forces continued to retreat from the territories Putin just claimed as his own.Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine.ArrowRight“I congratulate school workers in all 89 regions of Russia,” Putin said in his video message, emphasizing his new tally of Russian federal subjects — increased by four with the addition of the Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions in Ukraine that he is trying to seize.Putin’s surreal message to the war-torn areas amid cascading Russian military setbacks on the battlefield created a stark split-screen between the image of control that the Kremlin is trying to project and the reality on the front lines, where Russia has been losing ground for weeks. Earlier Wednesday, the president had signed the legislation to absorb the seized regions into Russia despite his lack of control.AdvertisementAs he spoke, the Russian leader gave no indication that his grip on the regions had already slipped. “Let me emphasize: Russia has been and will be sovereign,” he said, adding: “Above all, it is necessary to convey the moral cultural code of the Russian people to the children and exclude attempts to impose alien and perverted interpretations of history.”Highlighting the contradiction of Putin’s claim that Russia will remain in the four annexed eastern Ukrainian regions “forever” and the reality on the ground, however, the president’s spokesman conceded Wednesday that “certain areas” in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions were under Kyiv’s control and still needed to be retaken by Russia.“Control will be regained, nonetheless, over certain territories there, and we will continue to consult with that part of the population expressing the desire to live with Russia,” the spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said in a conference call with reporters.Putin faces limits of his military power as Ukraine recaptures landThe veneer Putin hoped to create of a successful annexation, absorbing four Ukrainian regions back into the “Fatherland,” was shattering amid ongoing criticism of his botched military mobilization aimed at calling up 300,000 new troops and glum, defeated reports of new battlefield losses by hawkish military correspondents with massive online audiences.Advertisement“Friends, I know that you expect me to comment on the situation, but I really don’t know what to tell you,” pro-Russian military reporter Roman Saponkov wrote on Telegram about Russian losses along the Dnieper River. “The retreat from the north of the right bank in the Kherson region is a disaster.”“Vysokopillya, Lyubimovka, Velyka Oleksandrivka, Davydov Grid, these places have been showered with the blood of our soldiers,” Saponkov added, listing key towns in Kherson that the Ukrainian army captured in just the past 48 hours.Just a month after Russian forces were routed from the northeast Kharkiv region in a lightning offensive, Ukrainian troops have made gains in Donetsk, and are pushing into Luhansk, the region where Russia had its strongest control.As Moscow acknowledged its defenses in the south had been breached, Russian audiences saw tense exchanges on television as top propagandists struggled to explain why the Russian military was experiencing setback after setback, and to manufacture some optimism.Advertisement“We have lost 17 settlements in the Kherson region,” Alexander Sladkov, a war reporter with Russia 1 state channel, said on air during one of the main talk shows, “60 Minutes.”“This is concerning, to say the least. Why there was no cover there?” the host, Olga Skabeeva, responded.“We are waiting for the reinforcement, it is coming, but if we throw them into battle now, pardon me, what will happen to them?” Sladkov said. “If we mobilized 300,000 people at the beginning of the war, when we had heavy casualties, we would’ve spent them, too. Now it’s different; we understand now that a soldier has to be prepared.”“When will there be positive changes for Russia?” Skabeeva asked.“If we are talking about big, significant offensives, I would say two months,” Sladkov replied.For fresh manpower, Putin is betting on the tens of thousands of mobilized men to shore up the depleted ranks of units fighting in Ukraine and grant leave to exhausted soldiers, some of whom haven’t been rotated out since the start of the invasion in February.Advertisement“In many sectors of the front line, fatigue has sunk in after a long offensive period, during which large territories were liberated,” Alexander Kots, a military correspondent for Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper, wrote Tuesday on his Telegram blog. “But there is no longer any strength left to hold them.”‘I refuse to comply,’ says Russian journalist, days after escaping house arrestWestern military experts say the Russian leader may be running out of time to turn around his ailing invasion and is facing a difficult choice: spend more time training the reinforcements but risk allowing Ukraine to advance its counteroffensive further, or throw the mobilized men into battle quickly in hopes that they will be able to hold ground despite some having little to no combat experience.But there was continuing evidence that the mobilization is not going well.Roman Starovoit, the governor of the Kursk region in western Russia, which is one of the key staging grounds for the invasion, described the state of some military units he recently toured as “awful.”Advertisement“I cannot understand how an active training unit of the Ministry of Defense can be in such a condition,” Starovoit said. “A ruined canteen, broken and rusty showers, lack of beds, and the existing ones are broken.”“There is a lack of uniforms, the parade ground looks as if it had been bombed,” the governor added. “It is good that at least there is equipment and weapons to refresh the skills and improve professionalism.”Officially, the Russian Defense Ministry has said the newly called-up soldiers will receive “up to one month of training.” But there have been multiple reports of military commissariats deploying soldiers to the front just days after they were summoned.The problems with the mobilization, which was announced just two weeks ago, snowballed so quickly that more than 20 Russian regional governors resorted to a rare public admission that mistakes had been made, and they carried out several public dismissals of enlistment officers.AdvertisementThere have been widespread reports of men unfit to serve being called to duty, including some who are blind, deaf, disabled or elderly.In a speech Wednesday, Putin accused the Defense Ministry of not cementing exemptions for students, professionals of key industries, and other people in the call-up regulations.“Initially, the Ministry of Defense reported that several categories of our citizens did not need to be called up as part of mobilization, but they still did not make the relevant changes to the regulations,” Putin said during a meeting with a group of teachers. “We now have to make appropriate corrections.”At least nine mobilized soldiers died even before they got to the battlefield, some of heart ailments, further raising questions about how enlistment officers are adhering to health criteria for recruits. Others died under murky circumstances. Local media reported that a young man died Sunday at a training site in Krasnoyarsk after a conflict between him and other men at the site.AdvertisementThree men from one garrison in the Sverdlovsk region died: one of a heart attack, and another by suicide; and a third, after he had been sent home, succumbed to liver failure linked to excessive alcohol consumption, an official told local news outlet EA News.Here are the nuclear weapons Russia has in its arsenalThese deaths reveal deeper issues in the mobilization efforts, linked to low morale and abysmal conditions in some training centers, where mobilized men sometimes have to sleep on the floor and where the Defense Ministry apparently lacks such basic provisions as socks, adequate food and uniforms.“Our guys need thermal underwear, warm socks, gloves, cigarettes, sugar, and canned meat,” a message read in one of the groups on Vkontakte, a social media site, organized by mothers and wives of Russian soldiers to crowdsource gear the men need.“My husband has just asked for these combat boots,” Anna, whose husband was recently called up, wrote in a Vkontakte chatroom.Natalia Abbakumova in Riga, Latvia, and Robyn Dixon contributed to this report.",Mary Ilyushina,Putin cites success in annexed regions even as his exhausted troops retreat
2,"LONDON — Prime Minister Liz Truss on Wednesday sought to shore up her authority after a brutal first month in office by asserting that while not everyone favors the changes her new government is pushing, “everyone will benefit from the result — a growing economy and a better future.”Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine.ArrowRightBut just moments into her keynote speech to the annual Conservative Party conference, she was interrupted by Greenpeace protesters carrying a banner that read: “Who voted for this?” They were quickly removed from the hall.British Prime Minister Liz Truss was heckled by two protesters holding a Greenpeace banner during her speech in Birmingham, England, on Oct. 5. (Video: Reuters)The Conservative Party conference, featuring a new prime minister, was a moment the party had hoped would mark a fresh start after the many scandals of her predecessor, Boris Johnson. Instead, Truss had to defend the first weeks of her premiership, already marked by historic economic volatility, a revolt within her party and voters turning away from Conservatives in droves.Who is Liz Truss, the U.K.’s new prime minister?“I’m ready to make the hard choices,” she said. She warned of “stormy days” ahead but insisted that Britain needs to “do things differently” and that “whenever there is change, there is disruption.”Advertisement“I am determined to take a new approach and break us out of this high-tax, low-growth cycle,” she told the party faithful gathered in Birmingham, England.Referring to the protesters later in her speech, she spoke dismissively about an “anti-growth coalition” made up of a broad swath of people in the country, including opposition politicians, “the militant unions, the vested interests dressed up as think tanks, the talking heads, the Brexit deniers, Extinction Rebellion and some of the people we had in the hall earlier.”The moment when Liz Truss’ speech is interrupted by Greenpeace protestors #ConservativePartyconference pic.twitter.com/YYRBMIPQLB— Karla Adam (@karlaadam) October 5, 2022

“The fact is they prefer protesting to doing. They prefer talking on Twitter to taking tough decisions,” she said. “They taxi from North London townhouses to the BBC studio to dismiss anyone challenging the status quo. From broadcast to podcast, they peddle the same old answers. It’s always more taxes, more regulation and more meddling. Wrong, wrong, wrong.”AdvertisementTruss came into office with a lot to prove. Although she had a somewhat prominent role as foreign secretary during the war in Ukraine, she wasn’t known to the British public the way Johnson — a colorful former mayor of London and newspaper columnist — had been before he took the helm.Truss was propelled not by a general election but by a leadership contest within her party. Even then, she wasn’t the first choice of Conservative Party lawmakers, and some of the grass-roots party members who rallied around her have admitted they already missed Johnson.Any momentum Truss had as incoming prime minister was cut short after two days by the death of Queen Elizabeth II. The new prime minister joined the new king in touring the four nations of the United Kingdom, but she played a marginal role.When attention eventually returned to politics, things took a dramatic turn for the worse. Her government’s plan to grow the economy through tax cuts primarily aimed at the wealthy, to be funded by billions in borrowing, sent investors scrambling to dump British assets. The pound sank to an all-time low against the dollar. The Bank of England had to intervene to quell a financial market revolt.Pound rebounds after U.K. government reverses part of tax policy that sent it plungingOnly after 10 days of economic turmoil and under intense pressure from her party did Truss reverse course, announcing Monday that she would abandon the most controversial element of her economic plan: a proposal to scrap the top rate of income tax.The pound has since rebounded. But divisions within the Conservative Party remain, as the conference proceedings this week have made clear. Home Secretary Suella Braverman on Tuesday lashed out at those within the party who “staged a coup” that “undermined the authority of our prime minister in an unprofessional way.”Meanwhile, public opinion of the Conservative Party has nosedived, falling by 20 to 30 points in the past two weeks.Advertisement“This is the most dramatic polling shift in my lifetime,” said Chris Curtis, head of political polling at Opinium research.The Conservatives have “lost the perception as them being the economically competent party — it’s as simple as that,” Curtis said.A poll published Tuesday night showed the opposition Labour Party leading the Conservatives by 38 points in the “red wall” areas in northern England that swung behind Conservatives in the 2019 election.If an election were held today, pollsters say the Labour Party would win its biggest majority.“What this shift in the polls shows is that the British electorate is increasingly volatile. It’s decreasingly aligned to party attachment. Voters will swing from one party to the next,” said Will Jennings, a professor of political science at the University of Southampton.U.K. facing massive train strikes, in new blow to Liz Truss’s governmentPolitics in Britain are much less polarized than in the United States. That’s partly because of Brexit, which prompted many people to walk away from parties they had supported for decades and to instead think of themselves as “leavers” or “remainers” — labels that crossed party lines. Now that Brexit is a done deal, voters are open to being swayed by other concerns.AdvertisementThat volatility means the pendulum could swing back and forth a number of times before the next election, which could be as far off as January 2025, and so neither the Conservative Party nor Truss is in immediate danger.Still, the Conservatives are known for ruthlessly ditching leaders who no longer seem like vote winners. Johnson was ousted halfway through his term in office, following a number of scandals, even though he led his party to a whopping majority in 2019.If Conservatives think Truss will drag them down, she could find herself booted out just like Johnson.“She’s in a vulnerable, delicate situation,” Jennings said. “If Conservatives stay at the current levels in the polls, [members of Parliament] will get very worried. One should never presume too much about political futures, but it’s certainly true she’s in a difficult spot. Recovering support of her MPs and voters will be a tremendous challenge.”",Karla Adam,U.K. Prime Minister Liz Truss defends first month in office amid protests

Earlier Wednesday, the president had signed the legislation to absorb the seized regions into Russia despite his lack of control.AdvertisementAs he spoke, the Russian leader gave no indication that his grip on the regions had already slipped. “Let me emphasize: Russia has been and will be sovereign,” he said, adding: “Above all, it is necessary to convey the moral cultural code of the Russian people to the children and exclude attempts to impose alien and perverted interpretations of history.”Highlighting the contradiction of Putin’s claim that Russia will remain in the four annexed eastern Ukrainian regions “forever” and the reality on the ground, however, the president’s spokesman conceded Wednesday that “certain areas” in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions were under Kyiv’s control and still needed to be retaken by Russia.“Control will be regained, nonetheless, over certain territories there, and we will continue to consult with that part of the population expressing the desire to live with Russia,” the spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said in a conference call with reporters.Putin faces limits of his military power as Ukraine recaptures landThe veneer Putin hoped to create of a successful annexation, absorbing four Ukrainian regions back into the “Fatherland,” was shattering amid ongoing criticism of his botched military mobilization aimed at calling up 300,000 new troops and glum, defeated reports of new battlefield losses by hawkish military correspondents with massive online audiences.Advertisement“Friends, I know that you expect me to comment on the situation, but I really don’t know what to tell you,” pro-Russian military reporter Roman Saponkov wrote on Telegram about Russian losses along the Dnieper River. “The retreat from the north of the right bank in the Kherson region is a disaster.”“Vysokopillya, Lyubimovka, Velyka Oleksandrivka, Davydov Grid, these places have been showered with the blood of our soldiers,” Saponkov added, listing key towns in Kherson that the Ukrainian army captured in just the past 48 hours.Just a month after Russian forces were routed from the northeast Kharkiv region in a lightning offensive, Ukrainian troops have made gains in Donetsk, and are pushing into Luhansk, the region where Russia had its strongest control.As Moscow acknowledged its defenses in the south had been breached, Russian audiences saw tense exchanges on television as top propagandists struggled to explain why the Russian military was experiencing setback after setback, and to manufacture some optimism.Advertisement“We have lost 17 settlements in the Kherson region,” Alexander Sladkov, a war reporter with Russia 1 state channel, said on air during one of the main talk shows, “60 Minutes.”“This is concerning, to say the least. Why there was no cover there?” the host, Olga Skabeeva, responded.“We are waiting for the reinforcement, it is coming, but if we throw them into battle now, pardon me, what will happen to them?” Sladkov said. “If we mobilized 300,000 people at the beginning of the war, when we had heavy casualties, we would’ve spent them, too. Now it’s different; we understand now that a soldier has to be prepared.”“When will there be positive changes for Russia?” Skabeeva asked.“If we are talking about big, significant offensives, I would say two months,” Sladkov replied.For fresh manpower, Putin is betting on the tens of thousands of mobilized men to shore up the depleted ranks of units fighting in Ukraine and grant leave to exhausted soldiers, some of whom haven’t been rotated out since the start of the invasion in February.Advertisement“In many sectors of the front line, fatigue has sunk in after a long offensive period, during which large territories were liberated,” Alexander Kots, a military correspondent for Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper, wrote Tuesday on his Telegram blog. “But there is no longer any strength left to hold them.”‘I refuse to comply,’ says Russian journalist, days after escaping house arrestWestern military experts say the Russian leader may be running out of time to turn around his ailing invasion and is facing a difficult choice: spend more time training the reinforcements but risk allowing Ukraine to advance its counteroffensive further, or throw the mobilized men into battle quickly in hopes that they will be able to hold ground despite some having little to no combat experience.But there was continuing evidence that the mobilization is not going well.Roman Starovoit, the governor of the Kursk region in western Russia, which is one of the key staging grounds for the invasion, described the state of some military units he recently toured as “awful.”Advertisement“I cannot understand how an active training unit of the Ministry of Defense can be in such a condition,” Starovoit said. “A ruined canteen, broken and rusty showers, lack of beds, and the existing ones are broken.”“There is a lack of uniforms, the parade ground looks as if it had been bombed,” the governor added. “It is good that at least there is equipment and weapons to refresh the skills and improve professionalism.”Officially, the Russian Defense Ministry has said the newly called-up soldiers will receive “up to one month of training.” But there have been multiple reports of military commissariats deploying soldiers to the front just days after they were summoned.The problems with the mobilization, which was announced just two weeks ago, snowballed so quickly that more than 20 Russian regional governors resorted to a rare public admission that mistakes had been made, and they carried out several public dismissals of enlistment officers.AdvertisementThere have been widespread reports of men unfit to serve being called to duty, including some who are blind, deaf, disabled or elderly.In a speech Wednesday, Putin accused the Defense Ministry of not cementing exemptions for students, professionals of key industries, and other people in the call-up regulations.“Initially, the Ministry of Defense reported that several categories of our citizens did not need to be called up as part of mobilization, but they still did not make the relevant changes to the regulations,” Putin said during a meeting with a group of teachers. “We now have to make appropriate corrections.”At least nine mobilized soldiers died even before they got to the battlefield, some of heart ailments, further raising questions about how enlistment officers are adhering to health criteria for recruits. Others died under murky circumstances. Local media reported that a young man died Sunday at a training site in Krasnoyarsk after a conflict between him and other men at the site.AdvertisementThree men from one garrison in the Sverdlovsk region died: one of a heart attack, and another by suicide; and a third, after he had been sent home, succumbed to liver failure linked to excessive alcohol consumption, an official told local news outlet EA News.Here are the nuclear weapons Russia has in its arsenalThese deaths reveal deeper issues in the mobilization efforts, linked to low morale and abysmal conditions in some training centers, where mobilized men sometimes have to sleep on the floor and where the Defense Ministry apparently lacks such basic provisions as socks, adequate food and uniforms.“Our guys need thermal underwear, warm socks, gloves, cigarettes, sugar, and canned meat,” a message read in one of the groups on Vkontakte, a social media site, organized by mothers and wives of Russian soldiers to crowdsource gear the men need.“My husband has just asked for these combat boots,” Anna, whose husband was recently called up, wrote in a Vkontakte chatroom.Natalia Abbakumova in Riga, Latvia, and Robyn Dixon contributed to this report.",Mary Ilyushina,Putin cites success in annexed regions even as his exhausted troops retreat
5,"LONDON — Prime Minister Liz Truss on Wednesday sought to shore up her authority after a brutal first month in office by asserting that while not everyone favors the changes her new government is pushing, “everyone will benefit from the result — a growing economy and a better future.”Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine.ArrowRightBut just moments into her keynote speech to the annual Conservative Party conference, she was interrupted by Greenpeace protesters carrying a banner that read: “Who voted for this?” They were quickly removed from the hall.British Prime Minister Liz Truss was heckled by two protesters holding a Greenpeace banner during her speech in Birmingham, England, on Oct. 5. (Video: Reuters)The Conservative Party conference, featuring a new prime minister, was a moment the party had hoped would mark a fresh start after the many scandals of her predecessor, Boris Johnson. Instead, Truss had to defend the first weeks of her premiership, already marked by historic economic volatility, a revolt within her party and voters turning away from Conservatives in droves.Who is Liz Truss, the U.K.’s new prime minister?“I’m ready to make the hard choices,” she said. She warned of “stormy days” ahead but insisted that Britain needs to “do things differently” and that “whenever there is change, there is disruption.”Advertisement“I am determined to take a new approach and break us out of this high-tax, low-growth cycle,” she told the party faithful gathered in Birmingham, England.Referring to the protesters later in her speech, she spoke dismissively about an “anti-growth coalition” made up of a broad swath of people in the country, including opposition politicians, “the militant unions, the vested interests dressed up as think tanks, the talking heads, the Brexit deniers, Extinction Rebellion and some of the people we had in the hall earlier.”The moment when Liz Truss’ speech is interrupted by Greenpeace protestors #ConservativePartyconference pic.twitter.com/YYRBMIPQLB— Karla Adam (@karlaadam) October 5, 2022

“The fact is they prefer protesting to doing. They prefer talking on Twitter to taking tough decisions,” she said. “They taxi from North London townhouses to the BBC studio to dismiss anyone challenging the status quo. From broadcast to podcast, they peddle the same old answers. It’s always more taxes, more regulation and more meddling. Wrong, wrong, wrong.”AdvertisementTruss came into office with a lot to prove. Although she had a somewhat prominent role as foreign secretary during the war in Ukraine, she wasn’t known to the British public the way Johnson — a colorful former mayor of London and newspaper columnist — had been before he took the helm.Truss was propelled not by a general election but by a leadership contest within her party. Even then, she wasn’t the first choice of Conservative Party lawmakers, and some of the grass-roots party members who rallied around her have admitted they already missed Johnson.Any momentum Truss had as incoming prime minister was cut short after two days by the death of Queen Elizabeth II. The new prime minister joined the new king in touring the four nations of the United Kingdom, but she played a marginal role.When attention eventually returned to politics, things took a dramatic turn for the worse. Her government’s plan to grow the economy through tax cuts primarily aimed at the wealthy, to be funded by billions in borrowing, sent investors scrambling to dump British assets. The pound sank to an all-time low against the dollar. The Bank of England had to intervene to quell a financial market revolt.Pound rebounds after U.K. government reverses part of tax policy that sent it plungingOnly after 10 days of economic turmoil and under intense pressure from her party did Truss reverse course, announcing Monday that she would abandon the most controversial element of her economic plan: a proposal to scrap the top rate of income tax.The pound has since rebounded. But divisions within the Conservative Party remain, as the conference proceedings this week have made clear. Home Secretary Suella Braverman on Tuesday lashed out at those within the party who “staged a coup” that “undermined the authority of our prime minister in an unprofessional way.”Meanwhile, public opinion of the Conservative Party has nosedived, falling by 20 to 30 points in the past two weeks.Advertisement“This is the most dramatic polling shift in my lifetime,” said Chris Curtis, head of political polling at Opinium research.The Conservatives have “lost the perception as them being the economically competent party — it’s as simple as that,” Curtis said.A poll published Tuesday night showed the opposition Labour Party leading the Conservatives by 38 points in the “red wall” areas in northern England that swung behind Conservatives in the 2019 election.If an election were held today, pollsters say the Labour Party would win its biggest majority.“What this shift in the polls shows is that the British electorate is increasingly volatile. It’s decreasingly aligned to party attachment. Voters will swing from one party to the next,” said Will Jennings, a professor of political science at the University of Southampton.U.K. facing massive train strikes, in new blow to Liz Truss’s governmentPolitics in Britain are much less polarized than in the United States. That’s partly because of Brexit, which prompted many people to walk away from parties they had supported for decades and to instead think of themselves as “leavers” or “remainers” — labels that crossed party lines. Now that Brexit is a done deal, voters are open to being swayed by other concerns.AdvertisementThat volatility means the pendulum could swing back and forth a number of times before the next election, which could be as far off as January 2025, and so neither the Conservative Party nor Truss is in immediate danger.Still, the Conservatives are known for ruthlessly ditching leaders who no longer seem like vote winners. Johnson was ousted halfway through his term in office, following a number of scandals, even though he led his party to a whopping majority in 2019.If Conservatives think Truss will drag them down, she could find herself booted out just like Johnson.“She’s in a vulnerable, delicate situation,” Jennings said. “If Conservatives stay at the current levels in the polls, [members of Parliament] will get very worried. One should never presume too much about political futures, but it’s certainly true she’s in a difficult spot. Recovering support of her MPs and voters will be a tremendous challenge.”",Karla Adam,U.K. Prime Minister Liz Truss defends first month in office amid protests
6,"As Russia’s military retreats on the battlefield, Vladimir Putin’s rhetoric about using nuclear weapons is escalating.Russia’s president has been warning of nuclear consequences with increasing intensity since the first week of his war in Ukraine — when he put his arsenal on higher alert. Now he is threatening to use nuclear weapons to defend the Ukrainian territory that Russia has illegally annexed.Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine.ArrowRight“This is not a bluff,” he warned the West. “And those who try to blackmail us with nuclear weapons should know that the weather vane can turn and point toward them.”What if Putin isn’t bluffing? What sort of nuclear strike is Russia, the country with the world’s largest stockpile of nuclear weapons, capable of — and what kind of destruction might it wreak in Ukraine and beyond?“Nuclear weapons, they’re unlike any other weapon,” said Joe Cirincione, a nuclear weapons expert who previously served as president of the Ploughshares Fund. “And that’s just the explosive part — not to mention the thermal effects and the temperatures that are produced.”AdvertisementIt is very unlikely that Russia would use its most powerful nuclear weapons to settle scores with Kyiv; Moscow is far more likely, experts agree, to use a smaller nuclear weapon in the hopes of achieving a specific battlefield objective. But, those same experts caution, once a nuclear weapon is unleashed, controlling what happens next is difficult.“Once you start talking nukes, all bets are off,” said Hans Kristensen, the director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists. “So it’s not clear how far this will go.”How many weapons?The first and most basic question about the Russian nuclear arsenal is: How many of the weapons does Russia have? It is a difficult one to answer.Nuclear weapons are commonly divided into two categories: strategic weapons — those being the longer-range missiles that can cross oceans and threaten rival superpowers — and tactical weapons, those that have a more limited capacity and arguably could serve a more limited function.AdvertisementThe United States has a good count of Russia’s strategic weapons, because Washington and Moscow are required to disclose this under the terms of New START, the last remaining arms control treaty. That count of strategic weapons is split among those deployed on intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) and those launched from bombers.But when it comes to the tactical weapons, the U.S. intelligence community can only offer its best guess, and different agencies have differing estimates. The ballpark figure they have settled on is between 1,000 and 2,000 tactical weapons (which, it should be noted, can be launched from ground launchers, ships and bombers but are not pre-deployed). After careful study, the Federation of American Scientists put its estimate at 1,912 — although it cautions that this could include weapons being retired or taken offline.How powerful are these weapons?The power of a nuclear weapon is its yield, and yield is measured as a TNT equivalent. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that the American bombs that were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki had yields of 15 and 21 kilotons, respectively — so equivalent to 15,000 tons and 21,000 tons of TNT.AdvertisementModern strategic nuclear weapons have enormous power. Standard ones can have yields of 500 kilotons, 800 kilotons and even 1 megaton — equivalent to 1 million tons of TNT. Russia holds the record for the most powerful weapon ever exploded: In 1961, it tested a bomb of at least 50 megatons, nicknamed “Tsar Bomba” — or the tsar of all bombs.In 2020, Russia released classified footage of the world's largest nuclear explosion, caused when the Soviet Union detonated the ""Tsar Bomba"" in October 1961. (Video: Reuters)Modern tactical weapons usually have a capacity of 10 to 100 kilotons, which still makes the average tactical weapon potentially more destructive than the bombs used on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Russia and the United States also have “low-yield” nuclear weapons that pack a “light” punch, even dipping below 1 kiloton. But even the least-powerful nuclear bomb — with a yield of about 0.3 kilotons — has about the same explosive power as the 2020 Beirut port explosion.What weapons would Russia be most likely to use?Russia has various kinds of tactical nuclear weapons. Some are designed for use by the navy, some to be used by the air force and others to be used by the army, either in surface-to-surface short-range missiles or in surface-to-air air defenses. The yield varies by purpose, since it takes more power to penetrate, say, an underground bunker than it does to stop an incoming warplane.AdvertisementRussia has different-size stocks of all these weapons. For example, the Federation of American Scientists believes Russia has about 500 tactical air force nuclear weapons, a figure that includes gravity bombs and air-to-surface cruise missiles. Many of those would be delivered by aircraft that we have seen on conventional bombing missions in Ukraine. These planes include the Tu-22 “Backfire” bomber that Russia has used to strike  Ukraine and the Su-34 “Fullback,” one of which Ukraine claimed to have shot down last month. But experts do not think the Russians are necessarily going to use those.The Russian Defense Ministry released footage on June 14 it says shows an Iskander missile system engaged in conventional battle in Ukraine. (Video: Associated Press)A far more likely candidate is the 9K720 Iskander missile system, classified by NATO as the SS-26, which is a ground-based ballistic missile. But according to Kristensen of the Federation of American Scientists, there are far fewer of these in Russia’s arsenal — only about 100 weapons. So why would Iskander be the nuclear delivery system of choice?“Simply because it’s the most reliable, and the one that would have the best chance of making it to its target,” Kristensen said. “Not being shot down, not failing.”Advertisement

How much destruction can these weapons cause?The first metric to pay attention to when estimating the destructive capacity of a nuclear weapon is its yield. If the kilotons number is bigger, the blast is going to be bigger, all else being equal. But all else is usually not equal. Terrain can be a factor — if there are hills in the area of the blast, they can buffer some of the radiating effects of the blast. If the target and the blast occur underground, the ground itself can absorb some of the blow. And whether the weapon is detonated on a surface or a just above the surface can also make a huge difference.

There are also the radiation, radioactive debris and long-term poisoning affects to worry about. But according to Kristensen, there are ways to avoid this impact if people in the blast area take proper shelter, which may not be available in a war zone.Advertisement“If you go down in your basement and you stay there with your ventilation system turned off for three to four days, then most of the acute radiation will have disappeared, so that you’re able to at least go out,” he said. But while people might be able to breathe more easily at that point, they will still have to make sure their food and water supply haven’t been compromised.Will there be a warning?History and Hollywood have instilled in our imaginations the image of world leaders with their fingers hovering over a big nuclear button, just one false flinch or sneeze away from lighting the world on nuclear fire. While the major strategic weapons can be launched within minutes of an order being given, that is not the case for Russia’s tactical weapons.Those weapons are stored at a limited number of facilities around the country, from which they have to be removed and transported. That process takes days, according to the experts. And those movements would probably be detected by U.S. and European intelligence services.AdvertisementThey will be watching for things like the mobilization of military units that aren’t usually active; an increased presence of strategic forces; and more trucks or trains appearing to move toward Ukraine from the locations where officials know such weapons are stored. In recent days, reports of armored train cars moving through central Russia caused a stir and some worried they were witnessing the first sign of a nuclear attack. But so far, the experts aren’t flinching.“Read that with an enormous grain of salt, because there are also all sorts of reasons for why the vehicles could be on those trucks,” Kristensen said, noting that U.S. intelligence agencies were strikingly quiet — which would not be the case if a nuclear attack on Ukraine were imminent.",Karoun Demirjian,Here are the nuclear weapons Russia has in its arsenal
7,"A coalition of oil-producing nations led by Russia and Saudi Arabia announced Wednesday it will slash oil production by 2 million barrels per day, in a rebuke to President Biden that could push up gas prices worldwide, worsen the risk of a global recession and bolster Russia in its war in Ukraine.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightThe move by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its partners prompted a blistering reaction from White House officials and reverberated almost immediately through domestic and global financial markets, threatening higher energy costs for the United States and European countries already grappling with inflation and economic instability.The cut to production also amplifies geopolitical tensions at a precarious moment for the world’s major powers. Biden administration officials had launched an extraordinary effort to press Saudi Arabia to produce more oil to compensate for the global shortage caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with the president personally visiting Saudi leaders in a trip to Jiddah. With this move, Saudi Arabia has rejected those entreaties at least in part, leaving senior White House officials contemplating their next steps and publicly hinting at unprecedented measures to undercut the gulf nation’s grip on international energy markets.AdvertisementRussia will benefit from the cut, because lower production will increase the price of oil — helping Moscow finance its war effort in Ukraine. And it could further test Europe’s resolve to support Ukraine ahead of what economists project will be a sharp slowdown in economic growth throughout the continent. American consumers could also be strained by higher gas prices, potentially imperiling the Biden administration’s determination to lower gas costs ahead of the 2022 midterm elections.This would be the first time the group cut oil production targets since the beginning of the pandemic. And it’s more aggressive than many analysts had expected even a few days ago. The OPEC Plus coalition, which is led by crude-oil giant Saudi Arabia, said the cut in production would take effect in November. OPEC Plus said in a statement the move was necessary to stabilize the recent fall in global energy prices.“The President is disappointed by the shortsighted decision by OPEC Plus to cut production quotas while the global economy is dealing with the continued negative impact of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine,” U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan and National Economic Council Director Brian Deese said in a statement.AdvertisementThe statement added that the administration will consult with Congress on additional mechanisms “to reduce OPEC’s control over energy prices” — suggesting the U.S. policymakers could be interested in repealing a long-standing exemption to federal antitrust law that allows the consortium to effectively coordinate on prices. If executed, that move would in turn elicit fierce pushback from Saudi Arabia and its allies, analysts say.U.S. economy stumbles into final stretch of 2022 facing new pressures“This clearly portends the potential for higher oil prices, reinforcing recessionary forces in the global economy and heightening risks for global financial instability,” said Mark Sobel, a former senior Treasury Department official.Energy stocks climbed slightly on the news, contrasting with declines in the overall financial markets. The immediate impact on gas prices remained unclear. Claudio Galimberti, head of Americas analysis at Rystad Energy, said gas prices are likely to increase in the United States perhaps by roughly 10 percent in much of the country, though the actual increase will depend on many factors.Advertisement“The intention of the OPEC Plus cut was to break the fall in crude prices since the summer,” said Bob McNally, an energy analyst at the Rapidan Energy Group. “If they succeed, then gasoline pump prices should also stop falling and range around current levels, until other market drivers impact the price.”The cuts come despite aggressive lobbying by the Biden administration for the consortium to continue production at current levels or higher — punctuated by Biden’s visit to Saudi Arabia in July. Biden had earlier in his administration vowed to make Saudi Arabia an international pariah, but he re-engaged while trying to use all available channels to curb increases in the price of gas that had hurt his domestic approval ratings. The administration had sought to isolate Saudi Arabia in part because of its human rights record.The production cuts could lead to considerable political fallout in the United States, where midterm elections will be held in just over a month. Falling gas prices this summer played a big role in lifting the political fortunes of Democrats, who face a tough election season. They also helped elevate Biden’s approval rating and gave the party a glimmer of hope for blunting a widely anticipated red wave in November.Americans are finally feeling better about the economy, partly because of easing gas pricesThe OPEC coalition’s move could also add to inflationary pressures in the United States and Europe, as well as undercut the effort to bolster Ukraine as it defends itself against the Russian invasion. Russia relies on gas and oil sales for a large portion of its budget and had pushed for the production cut, which will enable Moscow to sell oil for higher prices on the global market, generating more revenue for its war and troop mobilization.AdvertisementOil prices jumped this week in anticipation of today’s news. They are expected to increase further now, probably to over $100 per barrel.The Biden administration waged a last minute push to persuade Middle East allies not to dramatically cut oil production ahead of the meeting, according to senior administration officials. That effort, involving senior-level discussions with foreign counterparts, was seen internally as a long shot.One White House official quibbled with the suggestion that the Biden administration waged a major push to dissuade countries such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates from cutting production, saying it was a “minor effort.” Other officials said it was a more significant push but acknowledged that Biden was not making calls on the matter.In the Ukraine war, a battle for the nation’s mineral and energy wealth“A large supply cut would delight Moscow, which would benefit from both stabilized if not higher crude prices and an implicit sign of solidarity from its OPEC Plus colleagues as it braces for looming E.U. oil sanctions‚” McNally said before the cut was announced.The OPEC Plus coalition said it was making the move “in light of the uncertainty that surrounds the global economic and oil market outlooks, and the need to enhance the long-term guidance for the oil market, and in line with the successful approach of being proactive, and preemptive, which has been consistently adopted” by the group.AdvertisementBefore the OPEC Plus meeting, gas prices were already up sharply in some areas of the United States where there are several hotly contested congressional races, as well as close races for governor. Those increases were propelled by maintenance at refineries on the West Coast and a large fire at a refinery in the Midwest.Nevada, Washington, Oregon and Alaska have all seen prices jump by at least 40 cents a gallon over the past week. Throughout swing states in the Midwest, the increase has been less severe, but enough for drivers to notice the pain. In California, where there are at least eight close congressional races, prices jumped 62 cents over the last week to $6.38 per gallon of gasoline.As gas prices rise, Democrats scramble to lay blame on Big OilWhile the White House has little control over the price of gas, which is guided by global markets, Biden has more actively engaged on the matter than many of his predecessors. That includes his order to release 1 million barrels of oil per day from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, an action that helped lower prices but now makes the United States even more vulnerable to cost increases as it faces the challenge of replenishing.AdvertisementThe administration has already extended the release of that reserve oil into November. But the potential production cuts by OPEC Plus suggest the United States may not be able to restock at the lower prices administration officials had hoped.“We will continue to take steps to protect American consumers,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Tuesday, ahead of the announcement. “Our focus — and it’s been very clear for the past several months — has been on taking every step to ensure markets are sufficiently supplied to meet demand for a growing global economy.”She added, “Energy prices have declined sharply from their highs and American consumers are paying far less at the pump than they were several months ago.”However, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) told CNBC in an interview the cut in production should lead to a “wholesale reevaluation of the U.S. alliance with Saudi Arabia,” adding that Biden’s visit this year did not yield the necessary results from Riyadh. “When the chips are down, the Saudis effectively choose the Russians instead of the United States,” he said. “We need them right now.”U.S. economy stumbles into final stretch of 2022 facing new pressuresThe increasingly challenging realities of the global energy market are certain to raise tensions between the Biden administration and large oil producers. Biden and other Democrats have been repeatedly attacking oil companies for reaping record profits at a time when consumers are struggling to pay for a tank of gas.AdvertisementEnergy Secretary Jennifer Granholm has previously put oil companies on notice that the administration could use emergency powers to curb exports if the firms do not put more emphasis on boosting their domestic inventories. Oil executives and industry experts have warned such a curb on exports could backfire, tightening the global supply even further and discouraging investment in increased production.As the OPEC Plus production cut loomed, the leaders of the American Petroleum Institute and American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers sent Granholm a five-page letter on Tuesday warning that restrictions on exports “would likely decrease inventory levels, reduce domestic refining capacity, put upward pressure on consumer fuel prices, and alienate U.S. allies during a time of war.”Evan Halper, Adela Suliman and Amar Nadhir contributed to this report.",Jeff Stein,"Saudi Arabia, Russia defy U.S. with oil production cut as tensions rise"
8,"The unofficial anthem of Iran’s ongoing anti-government protests is a soulful song, with lyrics strung together from tweets sent out by demonstrators risking their lives to defy the country’s ruling clerics.Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine.ArrowRight“Because of dancing in the streets,” the song begins. In Iran, dancing in public is banned.“Because of every time we were afraid to kiss our lovers.”“Because of the embarrassment of an empty pocket.”“Because of yearning for a normal life.”Other lyrics name corruption, censorship, gender discrimination, environmental degradation and national tragedies, such as the near extinction of the Persian cheetah and the downing of a Ukrainian passenger plane in 2020, in what Iran’s government has said was a military accident.“Because of women, life, freedom,” the song concludes, echoing a popular protest chant: “Azadi.” Freedom.What’s behind the protests in Iran?Iranian singer Shervin Hajipour posted the song, “Baraye” — which means “for the sake of” or “because of” — to his Instagram account on Sept. 28. It accrued more than 40 million views, according to Amin Sabeti, a London-based expert on Iranian cybersecurity, by the time authorities forced Hajipour to take it down and arrested him the following day.AdvertisementThe song, according to Iranians interviewed by The Washington Post, gives voice to sentiments that have driven widespread anger and the largest anti-government protests the country has seen in years, which began with the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody in Tehran last month, and which have come to encompass a broad range of frustrations uniting Iranians fed up with grinding poverty, repression, gender segregation and human rights violations.Hajipour, 25, was released on bail Tuesday, according to Iranian state media. His lawyer did not respond to requests for comment. In an Instagram post after his release, Hajipour thanked his supporters and expressed his love for Iran, vowing not to leave. Some Iranians, however, suspected that his message, which included a line in which he denounced how his song was used politically outside the country, was forced. “Because of forced confession,” some tweeted in response.By then, “Baraye” had become ubiquitous across Iran and online platforms.AdvertisementHajipour’s arrest came as part of a brutal crackdown on the weeks-long protests. Authorities have killed more than 130 protesters, according to rights groups, arrested and injured thousands more, and cut off or slowed internet access across much of the country.“The song puts decades of depression, hurt and anger into simple words,” said Sarah, a 32-year-old fashion designer in Tehran who runs her business on Instagram. She would give only her first name, out of concern for her safety.As Iran protests persist, supreme leader blames foreigners for unrestSarah said she hears Hajipour’s “lullaby of hope” everywhere: played on mobile phones at protests, blasted from cars, sung by passersby in the streets, shouted from rooftops, chanted at schools and offices, and streamed across social media.“Shervin’s arrest [has] made the song even more popular because the injustice of this action has enraged people,” said Saeed Souzangar, a 34-year-old managing director of a technology company in Tehran. “This song is eternal and the anthem of the revolution, and no matter how much the system tries to stop it from being played, the more you will hear it.”AdvertisementSouzangar said Monday that he and his colleagues were spending much of their time either protesting — an experience, he said, that felt like “bungee jumping” — or searching for friends in detention.“My generation didn’t get to live freely in this country,” Souzangar said. “I want future generations to be spared from the psychological and emotional torture we experienced.”He told The Post on Monday that two friends had just been arrested for “spreading information about the protests,” and he did not know their whereabouts.On Tuesday morning Tehran time, Souzangar said he had been called in for questioning. He stopped responding to text messages.“This time, small concessions are not going to work,” he said Monday, referring to chants calling for an end to clerical rule. “Now, all these different groups in Iran have become one, and they have one demand.”For Iranian exiles, Mahsa Amini protests are a source of hope and painEvery wave of political change in Iran has been defined by key songs, slogans and media, said Negar Mottahedeh, a professor of Middle Eastern studies and film and media studies at Duke University. During major protests in 2009, sparked by concerns about election fraud, Twitter and hashtags became a key mobilizing tool in Iran and abroad.AdvertisementDespite the internet crackdown, Hajipour’s song has been able “to move quickly and change people’s hearts and minds,” a significant step even if it does not fundamentally alter the political system, she said.“Even if these protests die tomorrow, Hajipour’s song will continue to be a form of defiance and heard in every protest to come,” said Holly Dagres, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, a Washington think tank.Some of the lines of “Baraye” directly echo chants in the streets.“Because of my sister, your sister, our sister,” Hajipour sings, alluding to Amini, the woman whose death — in the custody of police who detained her for an alleged violation of Iran’s strict dress code for women — set off the protests.“For the ruins of poorly built homes,” another lines goes, in reference to the May collapse of a poorly built 10-story commercial building in Iran’s southwestern Khuzestan province. The catastrophe left the country grief-stricken and fueled weeks of anti-government and anti-corruption protests.AdvertisementTina, a 29-year-old from Iran’s Khuzestan province living in Tehran, who also spoke on the condition that only her first name would be used, said one line — “for forced heaven,” strictly enforced Islamic law — resonated the most.“This one signified all the years of oppression, violence and humiliation we woman have been living with in Iran, forcing us to follow rules that we don’t even believe in,” she said.Tina said that she works at a private company and that she and her colleagues play “Baraye” several times a day.In recent weeks while attending protests, she said, she has felt an intense sense of power and unity. But she has been left with a broken heart, she said, because Iran’s leaders are using violence against the unrest.Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, made his first public statements Monday, deriding demonstrators as agents of the West and “thugs, robbers and extortionists.” When protests broke out in 2019, sparked by a rise in fuel prices, the government shut the internet down for 12 days. Hundreds of people, by other estimates more than 1,000, died.“We are defenseless; no one cares about us except ourselves,” Tina said. “Most of the casualties are so young. … We are fighting this fight alone and with all of our might.”“Each ‘Baraye’ speaks to the pain and frustration that Iranians have been suffering,” she said.correction An earlier version of this article misspelled Amin Sabeti’s name.

After Russia’s February invasion, media access was swiftly blocked and Moscow banned what it deemed to be “fake” news of its assault on Ukraine.

10,"An energy supply crunch tied to the war in Ukraine could cause widespread blackouts in the European Union this winter, an official in charge of managing crises within the bloc has warned.The European Union is shoring up its resources as temperatures drop and preparing for two “conceivable scenarios”: One in which a few member states experience power cuts, and another in which blackouts occur in many member states at the same time, E.U. Crisis Management Commissioner Janez Lenarcic told Germany’s RND media.Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine.ArrowRightIn the first scenario, E.U. states could step in to provide targeted help to affected countries, including emergency power generators. But in the case of more widespread blackouts, the European Commission would be forced to draw from its strategic energy reserve, while individual countries would cap their emergency aid deliveries, Lenarcic added.How Europe is responding to Russia’s ‘energy war’ as winter comesEuropean officials insist they are better prepared for what’s to come than at the start of the war in Ukraine, with stores of natural gas in the E.U. at nearly 90 percent of capacity — 15 percent higher than the same day last year. Still, more needs to be done to ensure the bloc can quickly respond to “sudden disruptions” in energy supply, and to “better protect” critical networks in the E.U., European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a speech to the European Parliament on Wednesday.AdvertisementLenarcic’s comments on European readiness comes just ahead of an informal E.U. summit in the Czech Republic, where leaders will debate how to protect critical infrastructure following attacks on the Nord Stream pipelines built to deliver gas from Russia to Europe, as well as emergency measures to control soaring electricity prices.“The acts of sabotage against Nord Stream pipelines have shown how vulnerable our energy infrastructure is,” von der Leyen said. “It is in the interest of all Europeans to better protect [it].”Member states will also continue to debate if and how to cap the price of gas.E.U. urges gas rationing ahead of ‘likely’ cutoff by RussiaWhile blackouts are common in many parts of the world where the infrastructure is not able to withstand surges in demand, they are largely foreign to wealthy European countries — and experts have been sounding alarm bells about what power cuts could mean for consumers, including mobile network outages.AdvertisementCities across Germany took steps this summer to conserve energy, including by shutting off the lights at historic monuments and turning off public fountains. In France, luxury giant LVMH said it would turn off the lights at its stores earlier at night starting in October, and Paris has begun shutting the Eiffel Tower’s lights off shortly before midnight, instead of at 1 a.m.Experts say some of these moves are largely symbolic — the Eiffel Tower’s nighttime consumption of electricity is equivalent to the annual electricity consumption of just 56 French people, according to Radio France.But other effects could hit consumers harder: Last week, Reuters reported that some European telecoms businesses fear power cuts this winter could cause outages in mobile networks. In September, France’s power-grid operator said there will be times in the next six months when it will probably have to ask consumers to use less energy — typically by 1 to 5 percent, but up to 15 percent in extreme weather — to avoid overloading the system.Berlin’s landmarks go dark as Germany races to save energy for winter“The Russian war causes economic and social hardship,” von der Leyen said Wednesday. “Rising energy prices … are leading to reduced purchasing power and they are leading to a loss of competitiveness for our businesses in the international market.”AdvertisementThe war in Ukraine has caused a major upheaval in the way the E.U. procures its energy. Over a third of European electricity is generated by burning fossil fuels, including coal, oil and natural gas. Until recently, Russia was the bloc’s main supplier of crude oil and gas. But Russia has drastically reduced gas deliveries to European countries in recent months in response to the bloc imposing sanctions on Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine, forcing the E.U. to look for alternate suppliers, build its reserves and take steps to reduce consumption.The E.U. now imports about 7.5 percent of its gas from Russia, down from 41 percent at the start of the war, von der Leyen said Wednesday.E.U. accuses Russia of ‘blackmail’ after gas cut to Poland, BulgariaIn Germany, the risk of a national natural gas shortage this winter had gone down thanks to gas stockpiling, Eurasia Group, a political risk research and consulting firm, said in a note. However, it warned that “short, regional, and controlled electricity cuts (known as load shedding)” were “emerging as an increasing risk, especially in southern parts of the country.”Load shedding, the group noted, is less harmful to the economy “than uncontrolled blackouts or a gas emergency, as advance notice allows industry and households to prepare for temporary and localized outages.”",Annabelle Timsit,"The E.U. is preparing for blackouts this winter, amid an energy crisis"
11,"A lauded Scandinavian chess player was so angered by an opponent’s behavior during a game that he took drastic action.King Cnut, who ruled England, Denmark and Norway in the 11th century, was playing against an earl named Ulf in Roskilde when he made a move that broke the rules — prompting his noble opponent to overturn the chessboard and leave the room.Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine.ArrowRight“Ulf, you coward, are you running away?” Cnut called out, according to Snorri Sturluson, the great Icelandic poet and chronicler of the era.“You would have taken a longer flight in the river Helga, if I did not help you when the Swedes beat you like a dog; then you did not then call me ‘Ulf the coward,’” Ulf, the husband of Cnut’s sister and an important military ally, responded.Ulf was murdered the following day.A millennium later, chess games are still ending abruptly and in controversy, but with less bloodshed and more gossip on Twitter and Twitch.AdvertisementLast month, Norwegian world chess grandmaster Magnus Carlsen withdrew from an online tournament match after making just one move against a 19-year-old American, Hans Niemann.The resignation came shortly after Carlsen, considered by many to be the greatest chess player of all time, unexpectedly lost to Niemann in another tournament game, ending a 53-game winning streak.Carlsen later issued a statement, which included accusations that Niemann, who has acknowledged cheating in previous online games when he was younger, had “cheated more — and more recently — than he has publicly admitted.”“I believe that cheating in chess is a big deal and an existential threat to the game,” the 31-year-old wrote.Carlsen also said that Niemann, who has denied the allegations, received mentorship from player Maxim Dlugy, who was suspended from Chess.com in 2017 over supposed cheating.AdvertisementThe Norwegian player’s claims gained new momentum this week: On Tuesday, Chess.com released details of an investigation into Niemann which found the American may have cheated in more than 100 games on the online platform until he was banned in 2020The accusations shook the chess world, but they were nothing new: Chess has long been a game rife with allegations of chicanery and skulduggery. Cheating at chess is as old as the game itself. But as King Cnut demonstrated, the consequences of such accusations can be severe — with implications that can extend even to international politics.Perspective: When chess is hard and cheating is easy, the next move is complicatedAncient rivalriesThe full origins of chess are not known for sure, but it has roots in the Gupta Empire, in what is now India, where a game called chaturanga flourished in the 6th century.Like modern chess, it involved a black and white checkered board. It was modeled on warfare, with pieces representing infantry, as well as chariots and elephants.AdvertisementThe game soon spread, along trade routes and by wars of conquest. It went east, where it was adapted to the modern game of xiangqi or Chinese chess, as well as east to Persia and the Arab world.Cnut led an Anglo-Scandinavian empire that was built on centuries of Viking trade and raids, likely bringing the game back.But it was likely known in Europe at least a century or two before the murder of poor Ulf. Historian H.J.R. Murray suggested in his 1913 book “A History of Chess” that the game was probably introduced to Spain or Italy via Muslim traders.Even in these early stages, the game is known to have caused conflict. Murray’s book contains multiple instances of disputes among the royals, nobles and clergy who played.Some, like Cnut, were believed to have cheated (in the account of Cnut’s game offered by Icelandic historian and poet Sturluson, the king made a poor move and then demanded to replay it, in what would be considered cheating under modern “touch-move” rules).AdvertisementOthers were simply poor losers. William the Conqueror, who became the first Norman king of England in the 11th century, was said to have broken a chess board over the prince of France’s head after a loss.The Cold WarDespite the risk of violence at the hands of a royal, chess enjoyed continued popularity among the elites of Europe. Napoleon Bonaparte was one well-known player, even in exile.The rules were standardized over the centuries — and with that, more opportunities for cheating arose.One of the most notorious examples of chess-based trickery was that of the “Mechanical Turk,” a late 17th-century contraption that claimed to be an automated chess player. In fact, a human player was hiding inside. Somehow, both Napoleon and Benjamin Franklin were reported to have been taken in by the ruse.AdvertisementAs chess tournaments proliferated, another tactic became common: collusion, whereby players would withdraw or deliberately lose to help others progress.The issue gained attention after the creation of the International Chess Federation, known by its French acronym FIDE, and the increasingly high-stakes spectacle of the World Chess Championship, which became the site of Cold War chess battles — and accusations of cheating.In a 1962 Sports Illustrated article, U.S. prodigy Bobby Fischer accused Soviet players of deliberately drawing their games to preserve their energy for games against him. Four decades later, the former head of the Soviet team that year admitted the allegations were true.Fischer would go on to win the 1972 World Chess Championship, beating the Soviet player Boris Spassky.The U.S. victory was short-lived: Fischer would refuse to defend his title in 1975 and entered a long period of decline. In 1992, he won an unofficial rematch against Spassky but ended up facing an arrest warrant for breaking U.N. sanctions on Yugoslavia, where the match was held.Modern methodsThe end of the Cold War might have temporarily cooled the geopolitics of chess. But changes to technology soon meant there were far more opportunities for foul play.AdvertisementIn the 1993 World Open in New York, an unrated player who was able to force a draw against a grandmaster was accused of using technology to cheat. The player reportedly wore headphones, had a pulsing bulge in his pocket and appeared to not fully understand the basic rules of chess.Since then, the risk of technological cheating has affected chess at all levels. Three top French players were suspended for allegedly cheating via coded text message in 2011. Four years later, a Georgian champion was found to have an iPhone hidden in a bathroom during the 17th annual Dubai Open Chess Tournament.In modern chess, even the best players are no match for chess programs that can run on a phone. Garry Kasparov, the legendary Russian player, was able to beat IBM’s supercomputer Deep Blue in 1996, but he became the first world champion to lose a match to a computer the following year, when Deep Blue won a rematch.AdvertisementAs Nigel Short, an English chess grandmaster, put it to The Washington Post in 2015: “My microwave could beat Magnus Carlsen.”Aside from the frontier of cheating enabled by technological advances, politics has continued to contaminate chess. Critics say that FIDE is effectively controlled by Russia.From 1995 to 2018, it was led by Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, a former president of the Russian Republic of Kalmykia, whom the United States placed under sanctions in 2015 for supporting financially the Assad regime in Syria. Arkady Dvorkovich, a former Russian deputy prime minister, succeeded Ilyumzhinov.Despite controversy over the war in Ukraine, Dvorkovich was reelected for a second term last month, beating Carlsen’s Danish coach, Peter Heine Nielsen, and Ukrainian grandmaster Andrii Baryshpolets.With a game so suffused with distrust at a fundamental level, perhaps Carlsen can’t be blamed for being suspicious.Niemann has offered to play the game naked to dispel his doubters. That, to be fair, is an offer with which King Cnut never had to contend.This report has been updated.",Adam Taylor,"In chess, a long history of cheating, chicanery and Cold War shenanigans"

13,"MEDAN, Indonesia — It was his third soccer match.Muhammad Virdy Prayoga, 3, was just getting to know the game. He had watched his first match just a few months ago with his parents, and on Saturday, he entered Kanjuruhan stadium with more than 40,000 others streaming in to watch Indonesia’s second-largest derby. Arema FC, the home team for Indonesia’s eastern Malang regency, was facing off against Persebaya Surabaya, its rival from East Java.Are you on Telegram?

His mother, Elmiati, 33, turned on her phone to film a video and Virdy grinned widely at the camera, his eyes shining with excitement. He loved Arema FC; he loved watching the players far down on the pitch — and he loved being part of the crowd.Anger mounts toward police as Indonesia reels from stadium tragedyBut as chaos overcame Kanjuruhan stadium that night, culminating in what has become one of the deadliest sporting event disasters in the world, it was the crowd that took Virdy away from his mother.Advertisement“We didn’t know what was happening,” Elmiati said of the stampede. “People just kept pushing and shoving.”As fallout continues from the tragedy, arguably one of the most wrenching figures has been the number of children reported dead. Initially, officials said that there were 17, but on Wednesday, Wiyanto Wijoyo, the head of the Malang Health Authority, told The Washington Post that the number had more than doubled to 40. According to death certificates from local hospitals, he added, there were 131 fatalities in total.On Saturday, after the match, which Arema lost, a group of Arema supporters invaded the pitch and tried to approach players. Police and military personnel responded aggressively, using batons and riot shields to beat back supporters before firing dozens of rounds of nonlethal munitions including tear gas onto the pitch and directly into the stands. In the scramble to escape through the stadium’s narrow doors, some of which were locked, dozens of people suffocated or were trampled to death.Of the 101 people who were taken to Wava Husada Hospital on Saturday night and Sunday morning, 73 died, said Isabella Kusuma Anjelin, an emergency medicine specialist who was working at the time. Some were children, but few were as young as 3.AdvertisementElmiati, who, like many Indonesians, goes by one name, was watching the game from section 13 of the stands. When the match ended, she, her husband and their son were still in a good mood, although Arema had lost. They wanted to get home to their other daughter, 14, who had stayed home.She started to feel alarmed when she saw police charging onto the field. And when they started firing tear gas directly at the stands, near where she was seated, she started to panic.“The gas burned my throat, and it was stinging my eyes and skin,” she said. “They just kept firing and firing.”Desperate for the family to escape the thick cloud of tear gas, her husband, Rudi Hariyanto, 34, picked up Virdy as they tried to leave via gate 13. It was obstructed, allowing only one person at a time to pass through, Elmiati remembered. As people around her pushed to escape, she became separated from her husband and son.AdvertisementAfter getting outside, Elmiati learned from another family member who had also been at the game that Hariyanto and Virdy were still inside. She gave a photo of them to local authorities to see if they could help to identify them. Just after 11 p.m., about an hour after police first started firing tear gas, she got a call.Virdy was at Kanjuruhan Hospital, and Hariyanto was at Wava Husada hospital. Both had died.At Kanjuruhan Hospital, Elmiati held Virdy’s body, stroking his hair. His head had been bandaged and dried blood streaked from his nose. His face was pale and his eyes closed.“We were planning to send him to kindergarten next year,” Elmiati said. “Now he’ll never get the chance.”Malang police chief Ferli Hidayat was dismissed Tuesday over the disaster, along with nine commanders from the Mobile Brigade Corps, a paramilitary arm of the Indonesian National Police that was present at Kanjuruhan stadium during the clearing of supporters.

15,"SINGAPORE — At Love Handle, a deli that labels itself a butcher shop in downtown Singapore, there is no meat for sale. Instead, jackfruit pastrami is sliced into razor-thin strips, minced soy beef is drenched in teriyaki sauce and mushroom steaks are cut into filets.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightThe shop, whose black-and-white checkered interiors hold a butcher block, slicer and mincer, labels itself Asia’s first plant-based meat “butchery.” It caters to those who want to give up animal meat without sacrificing the comfort of a double cheeseburger and greasy nuggets.“Our inspiration was McDonald’s chicken nuggets,” said chef and co-founder Addis Tan, pointing to a steaming batch of breaded chicken substitutes. “We want customers to comfort eat food they can associate with memories or things their mom cooked.”Love Handle estimates that half of its customers are meat eaters experimenting with plant-based protein. The shop hopes to ease them into meat alternatives with products they can easily identify, such as substitutes for Italian herb meatballs and sausages.AdvertisementAlternative meats, which may include plant-derived products and animal meat grown from cells in labs, are becoming increasingly popular with consumers and investors. Market revenue is expected to roughly double, to $12.3 billion by 2029, according to market-research consultants Fortune Business Insights. However, some traditional-meat producers are skeptical that substitutes will continue to see rapid growth. They say alternatives fail to replicate the taste of animal meat and are likely to be eaten regularly only by a small group of consumers.In regions such as Southeast Asia that have fast-growing populations and are grappling with food export restrictions, substitutes for traditional meat are emerging as a reliable protein alternative. And it’s not just attracting vegetarians: The meat alternatives industry is becoming a darling of food security experts, venture capitalists and companies trying to protect themselves from supply chain crunches.The robots are here. And they are making you fries.Such alternatives often require less space, water, time and materials to make, according to researchers, making them more resilient to the supply chain shocks that have recently plagued the animal meat industry. In parts of the world, such as Northern Europe, some alternatives are becoming as cheap as traditional meat, a shift investors hope will reach more price-conscious consumers in less wealthy countries that are increasingly consuming meat.Advertisement“Soon having a meat steak will be a premium experience, a treat for a special occasion,” Tan said.Alternative meats, once considered a costly novelty, have become particularly attractive in the wake of avian flu outbreaks in Europe, pandemic lockdowns in China and the war in Ukraine, all of which battered the global supply of animal protein. In Asia, supplies were further restricted in May when Malaysia announced a ban — since loosened — on chicken exports and India placed curbs on wheat exports, a major ingredient in animal feeds.Global meat prices reached an all-time high in June, according to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization’s meat price index. (Prices have dropped slightly since but are still sharply up from a year ago.) The price of a dozen large eggs in U.S. cities also hit a record high of $3.11 in August.AdvertisementBy contrast, industry professionals say better technology and larger scale have allowed them to sell alternative meats at increasingly lower costs. In the Netherlands, meat substitutes became less expensive than animal protein in 2022, according to a study commissioned by a Dutch nonprofit organization that promotes meat alternatives. Some alternative egg products have also reached price parity with animal eggs.But on average, plant-based meat is two times as expensive as beef, and more than four times as expensive as chicken per pound, according to a 2021 report by the Good Food Institute nonprofit that cited Nielsen data.Some makers of meat substitutes in North America and Britain, such as Beyond Meat, have also struggled with higher costs and were unable to rapidly grow sales this year as inflation gives cost-conscious customers in key markets pause.For those who have long searched for meat substitutes, lower prices have been a game changer.Audrey Seah, 54, has been looking for alternative meats to create Southeast Asian dishes such as chicken rice and pulled beef rendang for her vegan husband. A few years ago, the products were too expensive for her budget and hard to find. Now, they have their own section in the frozen food aisle at her local supermarket.Advertisement“Prices have gone down, and in some supermarkets, you can now find alternatives at the same price as meats,” she said. Lower prices mean the Seah family eats more alternative proteins than ever.Investors are betting that these trends will continue, and as production of the alternatives increases and prices fall, new markets will open up. “We can’t compete with cheap chicken in Indonesia, but it is only a matter of scale,” said Michal Klar, a founding partner of Better Bite Ventures, a fund that invests in meat substitute start-ups in Asia. “It’s a Tesla model. You start high end, the scale is not quite there, but we are hoping that some countries can leapfrog the transition as people increase meat consumption.”Production of meat alternatives can also be more responsive to changes in demand, said Helga Angelina Tjahjadi, co-founder of Green Rebel, an Indonesian start-up that produces whole cuts of meat substitutes from mushroom fibers and soy. Scaling up production can be as easy as keeping a machine running longer or investing in larger equipment, she said. The company is also able to use the same machines to produce beef or chicken alternatives, allowing them to flip between products to cater to changing demand.The hype over plant-based foods overlooks a key ingredient: PlantsFor William Chen, developing an alternative to meat is a question of national security.AdvertisementThe food science professor at Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University has spent years developing a climate-resilient urban farming system, including a mushroom that he says can grow with no light and little water. Potential use cases include feeding a population through droughts, pandemics and even during a nuclear apocalypse.“You can literally grow them in your cupboard,” he said. “They are independent of all these conditions affecting us, like climate change or war.”Singapore, a small, densely populated country, imports some 90 percent of the food it needs to feed its 5.6 million people. With land scarce, most farming must be done vertically, in rooftop gardens and stacked greenhouses. The country hopes to use alternative proteins, including meat grown in labs and mushrooms bred in urban basements, to help grow 30 percent of its own food by 2030.AdvertisementThe Southeast Asian city-state is also courting companies looking to experiment with new ways of making food. In 2020, it became the first country in the world to allow cultivated meat to be sold to the public. Such meats are produced when cells extracted from living animals multiply in a lab and grow into an edible-size piece of meat.In June, food tech company Eat Just broke ground on a multimillion-dollar facility in Singapore, the largest cultivated meat production center in Asia, according to the company. The facility will have the capacity to produce tens of thousands of pounds of meat grown from animal cells.Eat Just also makes mungbean protein eggs, which require 98 percent less water and 80 percent less land to produce, the company said. This summer, it was able to match premium animal egg prices in many markets for the first time, offering its mungbean protein eggs for $3.99 a bottle, the equivalent of eight eggs.Advertisement“It’s not that we’re completely insulated from the global supply chain … but we are just less impacted than an egg company would be because we are not relying on a commodity that’s going up and down based on all these factors,” Eat Just founder Josh Tetrick said.“A conventional animal protein system is not built for the world of increasing climate risk,” said Tetrick. “It’s not built for a growing population or a world of water scarcity. It’s not built for a world that needs more food security.”But for some consumers, the trade-off remains too costly.“It’s trying too hard and charging too much,” said Clare Chua, a 31-year-old business developer, as she bit into a $17 double cheeseburger with a soy patty and plant-based cheddar slices at Love Handle. “If you want to go vegetarian, just eat vegetables.”",Marina Lopes,"Supply chain woes boost meat substitutes in Asia, and investors are biting"
16,"As the summer of 1989 approached, a 35-year-old official in southern Fujian province named Xi Jinping was scrambling to contain local offshoots of nationwide protests that would become the biggest crisis for the Chinese Communist Party since Mao Zedong’s rule.Students were calling for democratic freedoms. They wanted an end to official corruption and censorship of the press.Xi, the Ningde city chief, and other Fujian officials struggled to figure out what to do as some 100,000 people took to the streets over several months starting in April, fired up by reports of students occupying Beijing’s Tiananmen Square. Some piled into the railway station in Fujian’s provincial capital, bringing trains to a standstill. Fujian police arrested thousands, according to local official histories. But more kept coming.AdvertisementBy the time Xi emerged 23 years later in 2012 as China’s top leader, many thought he represented a party that had mellowed in its advancing years. Since 1989, the Chinese leadership had moved toward what outside observers saw as a more stable system of collective rule. To prevent Mao-style personality cults, senior leaders shared power and the head of state was confined to two five-year terms. Xi, they prophesied, would be a liberal reformer.These predictions proved badly misguided.Xi Jinping’s crackdown on everything is remaking Chinese societyRather, the party was seriously concerned about its survival. Under the lax leadership of Xi’s predecessor, Hu Jintao, rampant corruption, factionalism and mounting social discontent were undermining legitimacy. Xi was brought in to clean up the mess.Over the last decade, Xi has reversed political changes of the 1980s designed to prevent over-centralization of power. He has done away with presidential term limits, reasserted party control and elevated his personal status to a level unseen in at least 30 years, if not the Mao era.At a crucial party congress beginning Oct. 16, Xi is set to complete his elevation to uncontested paramount leader. “Xi Jinping is somebody who has spent years making the whole ideological apparatus say that the party only works with him as leader, and only his way of thinking about things is accurate,” said Joseph Torigian, a China historian at American University in D.C.From early in his career, including in Fujian, Xi demonstrated a commitment to defending the party from perceived threats. After taking power, he launched a cleanup campaign that mirrored the party’s actions following Tiananmen, when it slammed the brakes on political change and rallied around a strongman leader, Deng Xiaoping, to steer the nation out of crisis.Now, it is increasingly unclear when Xi will consider his role as savior of the party completed. He speaks regularly of a world undergoing “changes unseen in a century” and warns of the grave dangers of relaxing political authority. Only with the party in command, Xi says, can China achieve its “great rejuvenation.”As crackdown eases, China’s Xinjiang faces long road to rehabilitationIt won’t be easy. As he begins his third term, he must contend with a severe economic slowdown and spiraling tensions with the United States and its allies. And many of the challenges Xi faces are related to his choices.Strict “zero covid” policies have hammered the economy. After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, his close partnership with Vladimir Putin has fueled concern in Western nations over Beijing’s intentions, following harsh security clampdowns in Hong Kong and Xinjiang. And China’s military aggression toward Taiwan is threatening to destabilize the region and bring tension with the United States to a head.AdvertisementBut early indications suggest Xi is preparing to ramp up, not tamp down, his policy ambitions after the meeting. In the last year, Xi has intensified policy initiatives to promote China’s vision of global development and security as well as an ambitious drive to deliver “common prosperity” by tackling inequality at home.Aside from being reappointed general secretary of the party and chairman of the party’s Central Military Commission (and therefore almost certainly staying on as president from early next year), analysts predict that Xi will probably achieve a “supermajority” of politicians within his network on the 25-member Politburo that sits at the apex of power. Pekingologists are watching to see if he receives a new official title such as “people’s leader” or “party chairman.” Few expect a successor to emerge at the twice-per-decade conclave.“Counterintuitively, the more problems that the system faces, the more of a case that Xi Jinping can make that it was right” for the party to give him broad decision-making powers and authority as the “core” of the leadership, Torigian said.China’s State Council Information Office and Foreign Ministry declined to answer questions for this article.Party manIn 2012, as Xi was preparing to be confirmed as China’s next top leader, the party was struck with one of the largest political earthquakes it had faced since 1989. Bo Xilai, a contemporary of Xi’s and contender for a top leadership position, fell from power in a scandal that revealed deep fractures and glaring abuses of authority in the senior ranks.As the Arab Spring was deploying social media and promises of democratic reforms to topple authoritarian regimes, official corruption was everywhere in China. And an angry public was increasingly calling it out online, posting pictures of cadres with Rolexes and fueling rule-of-law activism.AdvertisementAs a “princeling” son of a revolutionary leader with a record of loyalty, Xi was brought in to put the nation back on track. “There was a broad consensus that the party was at an existential turning point and that something needed to be done,” said Christopher Johnson, a former senior China analyst at the Central Intelligence Agency and CEO of China Strategies Group.After taking power, Xi immediately warned officials about the seriousness of the situation. In internal speeches, he said that tackling corruption was a question of survival for the party.In contrast to other authoritarian leaders including Mao, who occasionally ran roughshod over established institutions to grab power, Xi has largely worked within the party to strengthen its levers of power while placing himself in a unique position to operate them.One example is how he turned an anti-graft campaign designed to enforce discipline and punish excess after Bo’s downfall into an expanded and permanent National Supervisory Commission, established in 2018. “That’s why he is so powerful now. If he controls that institution, then he can compel consent from colleagues on policies and decisions of his preference with the threat of disciplinary investigation,” said Ling Li, a lecturer on Chinese politics and law at the University of Vienna, adding that the extent to which Xi has achieved complete personal control over the anticorruption apparatus is unclear.In January 2013, two months before he assumed the presidency, Xi advised against denigrating either Mao or Deng for fear that the People’s Republic could collapse like the Soviet Union. He oversaw a mass education campaign for cadres who watched a documentary about the Soviet regime’s final years. It warned of the need to be “vigilant in peacetime” and spoke of “bitter lessons” from Mikhail Gorbachev’s failure to prevent the party from unraveling.AdvertisementThe moral of the Soviet Union’s demise continues to animate Xi’s leadership today. In July, the docuseries was rereleased by the official social media account of World Socialism Studies, a research institute under the state-run Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.After Gorbachev’s death on Aug. 30, Chinese nationalists called him a “villain of history.” The propaganda department of Zhejiang province said that “he did indeed bear unavoidable responsibility” for the Union’s breakup.U.N. report: China may have committed crimes against humanity in XinjiangIn the name of preventing “separatism,” Xi imposed draconian national security legislation on Hong Kong to end protests over creeping interference from Beijing. He has pursued a policy of mass detention and forced assimilation in Xinjiang, which the U.N.'s human rights commissioner recently ruled may constitute crimes against humanity. He has declared that self-governing Taiwan “must and will” come under Chinese Communist Party rule.Xi’s dedication to the party is apparent in little-known essays and speeches reviewed by The Washington Post from his 17 years in Fujian — as is his tendency to respond to periods of uncertainty with more-concentrated control.AdvertisementOne lesson Xi took from Tiananmen was that art and literature could be a threat to the party, presaging the shift to stricter censorship under his rule. In October 1989, Xi wrote in local literary magazine “Caibei” that art could not be allowed to be used “as a political tool.” He criticized an avant-garde exhibition held in Beijing before the protests, where one artist had squatted over eggs like a chicken and another washed his feet in a bowl.Unmentioned by Xi was the most notorious part of the show: A 26-year-old art student had illegally fired a gun, as part of her performance art, after which she was immediately arrested. “It’s impossible for any nation’s government or ruling party to not meddle at all in literature and the arts,” Xi wrote. “The difference is only in the extent of the interventions. Standards vary.”At the same time as Xi led efforts to tamp down protests in Ningde, the party’s top leadership was creating a hard-line position against political liberalization that would persist until Xi and sharply intensify under his tenure.“Never Turn Back,” a recently published history of the 1980s in China by Harvard scholar Julian Gewirtz, shows that substantive debates about political reform, led by then general secretary Zhao Ziyang, took place throughout the decade, but hard-liners within the party swiftly ended them after Tiananmen.Propaganda directives from the time gathered by Gewirtz describe how the crisis awakened the party to the failure of ideological and political work during the 1980s. A report by state investigators noted a “loss of faith” in the party and socialism, prescribing targets for ideology and politics like those for the economy.AdvertisementTo reassert control after the purge of Zhao, Deng was designated as the “core” of the party, a title he conferred to his chosen successor, Jiang Zemin. In May 1989, Deng advised that leaders should “not be dissatisfied with each other, do not deplete your own power. … The key is the leadership core.”Xi has ruled by that same mantra. He was crowned “core” leader in 2016, a title that eluded his predecessor. An important resolution on party history passed in November secured Xi’s position as the unquestioned leader for the foreseeable future, when it ruled that establishing Xi Thought as guiding ideology and establishing Xi as core of the party “expressed the deepest wishes of the whole party, the whole military, and the peoples of the whole country.”Ideological focusWeeks after the Tiananmen crackdown, in July 1989, Xi hiked into the backcountry with a straw hat and walking stick, to visit the impoverished village of Xiadang. Xi had chosen the village, one of the most remote in Ningde, for the center of his poverty alleviation push.It was the carrot to the stick of a security buildup to tamp down political unrest, as recorded in local gazetteers. Even as Xi hiked the hills touting economic opportunity, the county where Xiadang was based had just built a munitions warehouse and started twice-a-year patriotic training for militias. Soon after, provincial authorities announced police may take anyone who did not produce their national ID card back to a police station.Xi would report incredibly rapid success: More than 96 percent of destitute people in his district pulled out of abject poverty in two years.AdvertisementXi has since brought a similar deal to China’s people on a larger scale. Poverty alleviation has been one of his hallmark campaigns, capped by his declaration in early 2021 that China had eradicated extreme poverty. As with his experiment in Xiadang, the nationwide poverty relief campaign came with parallel measures to quell political dissent, with some of the harshest execution reserved for ethnic minorities in Xinjiang.In Xiadang village today, the myth of Xi the man blends seamlessly into the nationwide initiatives he is credited with creating. Xi’s quotations sprawl across walls and buildings in large, red characters. Local museums show photos of Xi personally leading the charge, walking through fields with a hoe slung over his shoulder.Central to Xi’s mode of rule is renewed enforcement of the ideological “mass line” within the party — shorthand for following directions set by the top leadership. His eponymous philosophy, Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, is taught in schools and pored over by economic planners, People’s Liberation Army generals and diplomats.“Ideological control is not a supplement, but arguably the foundation of political control, because if an autocrat can control people’s ideas and beliefs, there would be no need for coercion,” said Yuen Yuen Ang, a professor of politics at the University of Michigan.The fear is that Xi has over-centralized power, making criticism of his policies tantamount to criticism of the party itself. Ang sees this dynamic at play with the sidelining and silencing of voices that criticized Xi’s “no limits” partnership with Russia — a move that escalated Western perceptions of China as a threat.Taming TaiwanIn 1995, the 42-year-old Xi found himself on the front lines of a different crisis. The United States had allowed Taiwan’s President Lee Teng-hui to visit, infuriating Beijing, which claimed Taiwan as a runaway province. The People’s Liberation Army mobilized troops in Fujian.Pelosi’s Taiwan visit ushers in new phase of China’s pressure campaignXi was head of Fujian’s capital Fuzhou, and also held a military title. While it’s unclear if he was directly involved in the barrages of missiles fired from Fujian into the waters around Taiwan that year, he must have keenly followed events. When Xi was promoted to governor, he ordered a buildup of military installations, citing Lee’s trip and the threat of Taiwan “separatism,” according to an essay he published in 2000.Since becoming president, Xi has expressed impatience on Taiwan, saying in 2019 “we should not allow this problem to be passed down from one generation to the next.” He has ramped up naval drills near Taiwan, raising alarms that he could be flirting with the idea of invasion.In August, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) visited Taiwan, plunging U.S.-China ties to fresh lows. China’s ambassador to France declared that Taiwan’s people would need to be reeducated after unification, in line with Xi’s broader push for ideological allegiance.Loyalty enforcing mechanisms have been strengthened from the top to bottom rungs of the party. Low-level members are encouraged to attend study sessions where they learn about ideology and pledge fealty. At the highest level, the members of the Politburo since 2018 have been required to present annual reports to Xi for his approval and feedback.AdvertisementXi first adopted a similar practice in April 1989 when he set up a “responsibility system” for Ningde officials, including himself. They would be assessed on progress toward self-set goals and be “severely punished” for inaction, according to a front-page article in the official Fujian Daily newspaper from the time.As students filled the streets in May 1989, Xi called a news conference in Fujian. He reminded local journalists of the chaos of the Cultural Revolution, and argued that restricting personal freedoms was necessary for society to function. The elision of freedom with lawlessness was an easy one to make, and one that Xi’s party still makes today.“If everyone just does what they want,” he said, “do you still have guarantees of your democracy and security? Can it really be done this way? So democracy cannot be absolute. It must have certain constraints.”Dou reported from Ningde, China.

17,"TOKYO — North Korea has ramped up its missile tests this year as it expands its weapons program, conducting 23 launches since January. In the past two weeks, it fired five rounds of missiles.But its test on Tuesday raised the stakes: It flew a missile over Japan for the first time since 2017. It didn’t warn Tokyo in advance. And that missile flew farther than anything previously launched by North Korea.Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine.ArrowRightMissile tests can serve many purposes, including improving technical capabilities and sending a political message, both domestically and globally. They also serve as a reminder of the lack of progress on jump-starting nuclear negotiations with the regime and how Pyongyang’s military capabilities have evolved during the stalemate.So what’s going on?Flying over JapanOn Tuesday, residents in northern Japan woke to sirens warning them of the missile launch. North Korea fired an intermediate-range ballistic missile at 7:22 a.m. Japan time, which flew 4,600 kilometers (2,858 miles) for 22 minutes over Japan’s Aomori prefecture before landing in the Pacific Ocean, Japanese officials said. It reached an altitude of 1,000 kilometers (621 miles).AdvertisementIt’s not clear what type of weapon it was. Japanese Defense Ministry officials say it may be similar to the Hwasong-12, which can reach Japan and Guam, a U.S. territory in the Pacific Ocean. The missile may be an upgrade from the Hwasong-12, given its trajectory and the distance it traveled, according to Kim Dong-yup, a former South Korea Navy officer who teaches at Kyungnam University in Seoul.Why has North Korea stopped boasting about its missile tests?North Korea has been aggressively testing its weapons in line with leader Kim Jong Un’s five-year plan. Earlier this year, Kim said he would “strengthen and develop” his country’s nuclear and weapons program at the “highest possible” speed.North Korea typically lofts missiles high in space, which then land in the waters in between the country and Japan to avoid threatening the security of its neighbors. Launching one across Japan may have been intended to make a political point, some experts say.Why now? Why Japan?We don’t exactly know what that point may be; North Korea is one of the most closed-off countries in the world, and it hasn’t publicly talked about its missile launches in six months. But there are clues that can help experts understand what message it may be trying to send.AdvertisementFor the past two months, the U.S., South Korean and Japanese militaries have been conducting military exercises designed to demonstrate their readiness to work together in the event of a conflict. While the allies say the drills are defensive in nature, Kim’s regime has long viewed them as hostile acts and used them to justify its weapons development and nuclear program.After Tuesday’s test, the U.S., South Korean and Japanese militaries launched air, sea and land drills in response.The United States and South Korea held live-fire drills on Oct. 5 after North Korea fired a ballistic missile over Japan for the first time in five years. (Video: Reuters)Security dynamics in Northeast Asia have become increasingly volatile with China’s growing military threats and in the aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Since the invasion, North Korea has drawn closer to Russia, while Japan’s relations with Russia have deteriorated.South Korea, U.S. begin military drills likely to draw North’s ireAs U.S.-China competition intensifies, China has drawn North Korea closer. South Korea and North Korea have grown further apart, with a new conservative government in Seoul eager to side with Washington to take a harder line toward Pyongyang.AdvertisementGiven this backdrop, North Korea may see an opportunity to exploit the instabilities in the region and remind a world focused on Russia’s war in Ukraine that it still matters, said Robert Ward, senior fellow for Japanese Security Studies at the International Institute for Strategic Studies.China, Russia draw North Korea closer than ever“The missile launch intensifies the security threat along Japan’s western flank — Russia to the north, North Korea in the center and China to the south. One important strategic threat to watch for is cooperation between Russia-China-North Korea, which amplifies the risk to Japan,” Ward said.From the North Korean perspective, there are not many flight-path options for a missile with a range exceeding 4,000 kilometers other than the route over northern Japan and toward the Pacific Ocean, said Masashi Murano, a Japan chair fellow at the Hudson Institute in Washington. The other options would be seen as an effort to strike the U.S. mainland or to reach Guam.Pending nuclear testA familiar cycle of escalation appears to be taking shape.AdvertisementTo some analysts, Tuesday’s test was reminiscent of the ramped-up tensions and rapid diplomacy that began five years ago. In August 2017, North Korea launched a ballistic missile over Japan amid threats from President Donald Trump that he would unleash “fire and fury” if Pyongyang kept ratcheting up tensions with repeated missile tests. In September 2017, North Korea conducted a nuclear test.What does North Korea’s new monster ballistic missile test mean?Again, North Korea is probably gearing up for its first nuclear test since 2017. According to commercial satellite images and statements from intelligence officials, North Korea apparently completed preparations for its seventh nuclear test and is waiting for the right political moment to hit the button.The United States and its allies intend to seek an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council to discuss the North’s latest provocation. But China and Russia, two of the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, have sided with North Korea since Pyongyang started its volley of ballistic missile tests in violation of the council’s resolutions banning them.AdvertisementMeanwhile, diplomatic relations between the United States and North Korea have hit a wall.Since denuclearization talks collapsed at the 2019 summit between Trump and Kim, U.S. and South Korean negotiators have urged North Korea to return to negotiations, saying they have no preconditions to resume dialogue. But the Biden administration has not shown it is willing to grant the sanctions relief that Kim seeks.",Michelle Ye Hee Lee,North Korea is turning up the heat again. Here’s why.
18,"Russian President Vladimir Putin is betting that an impending infusion of drafted troops can change the dynamic on the battlefield in Ukraine, but analysts say he is losing time, as his military operation succumbs further to Ukrainian advances and shows signs that it needs more than just raw personnel to regain the initiative.Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine.ArrowRightPutin has distracted attention from the bleak battlefield picture in recent days by orchestrating referendums, declaring annexations and making nuclear threats — all part of an attempt to freeze Russian territorial gains amassed since February that are unraveling by the day.But those political machinations in Moscow, carried out with great fanfare and bluster, have been unable to mask the reality some 600 miles away in Ukraine: Russia’s force is beleaguered and poorly managed — and in the immediate future, there may not be a silver bullet to fix it.AdvertisementMilitary analysts agree that Russia’s haphazard mobilization of at least 300,000 reservists is unlikely to help Putin on the battlefield in a matter of days. Whether it can aid Moscow in stabilizing the situation longer term — into the late fall, winter and spring — is an open question, they said.Searching for bodies with the Ukrainian captain collecting Russian corpsesThe impact of the new soldiers depends partly on whether they can be trained effectively — and how the Russian military organizes and deploys them.“People are not beans. Units are not units, except on a map,” said Frederick Kagan, a senior fellow and director of the critical-threats project at the American Enterprise Institute. “If you take a bunch of pissed-off, demoralized, scared, untrained humans, give them weapons and throw them into a fighting force, you don’t have soldiers.”Putin will have to focus first on restoring basic fighting capability to a military with badly depleted units that need to be reequipped at scale, which is difficult, Kagan said. “Before we are talking about flooding the zone, we are really talking about restoring combat units to anything like combat capability,” he said.AdvertisementHow much territory the Russians lose before the reinforcements arrive isn’t entirely down to Moscow. Ukraine has been beating back the Russians on two major fronts for more than a month. It is unclear how long Ukrainian forces, which are suffering losses of their own, can sustain the push.“One of the hardest things to know is when to stop,” said Christopher Doherty, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security. “Just as you’ve made this huge gain, you’ve stretched all of your logistical line, many people have been in combat for days on end. There is a psychological bump you get from winning and being on the offensive, but everybody runs out of juice at some point.”At the moment, Ukraine is keeping up its momentum. In the east, its forces wrested back the city of Lyman over the weekend and are advancing into the occupied Luhansk region. The Ukrainian counteroffensive in the south, meanwhile, has quickened in recent days, with forces moving down the Dnieper River toward Kherson.AdvertisementWhere and when the Ukrainian counteroffensive ultimately pauses will also depend on weaponry and ammunition, much of it coming from the United States.On Tuesday, the Biden administration announced an additional $625 million in aid to Ukraine, including four more HIMARS rocket launchers, 16 155-mm Howitzers and 75,000 155-mm artillery rounds. Ukraine has asked for longer-range rockets and tanks but so far hasn’t received them. The United States has committed more than $16.8 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since the start of the Russian invasion on Feb. 24, according to the White House.Russia regularly warns of consequences if the United States and its allies continue to arm Ukraine but has proved unable to disrupt the flow of weaponry. The Russian Foreign Ministry said Tuesday that the amount of American arms being given to Kyiv had reached a “dangerous line.”AdvertisementDisappointment about Moscow’s battlefield position has seeped into the public sphere in Russia, primarily through Telegram channels but also at times on tightly controlled state television.Russian military blogger Maxim Fomin, who posts under the pseudonym Vladlen Tatarsky, said in a video uploaded Tuesday to Telegram that the situation on the front for Russian forces is “not great, to put it mildly.”Russia doesn’t have enough forces on the battlefield “to solve the Ukrainian question decisively,” he said, expressing concern that draftees about to be sent to the front in many cases are not receiving proper training.“You can fight with unprepared people, but it’s fraught with big losses,” he said.Andrei Marochko, a Russia-backed militia official in Luhansk, told the Russian state television show “60 Minutes” that the Ukrainians backed by NATO were operating with superior battlefield intelligence capabilities.Advertisement“They literally look in real time online with satellites at our movements, our fortification structures,” Marochko said. “That gives them certain privileges and makes their chances of success a lot higher than ours.”He said the Russian side had fewer forces than the Ukrainians in a number of locations, offering up a rationale for Putin’s recent mobilization.Rapid loss of territory in Ukraine reveals spent Russian militaryThere are few indications that any of the major problems that have been dogging the Russian military since the start of the invasion have been solved. For months, it has faced difficulty carrying out combined ground and air attacks, leading troops with a variable will to fight and organizing a complicated logistics pipeline to get supplies to the front.More than seven months in, no clear commander of the Russian campaign has emerged in public, and recent reports have suggested that Putin is intervening personally to make battlefield decisions. Hard-liners within Russia have attacked the country’s generals publicly for poor decision-making.AdvertisementThe problems Putin is facing in Ukraine are compounded by risks at home. The mobilization has made the war in Ukraine real for many Russians who had been paying little attention.The result is likely to be many more Russians — including those with sons, brothers and husbands now headed to the front — searching out information about how Russian forces are faring.“They have given people a reason to pay attention to what is happening on the battlefield,” said Sam Greene, a professor of Russian politics at King’s College London. “When you are not being sent there, you can just kind of get news off the television, and the television isn’t going to tell you much. Now all of a sudden it matters to you.”At the same time, the Russian state has fumbled in its execution of the draft, calling up men meant to be disqualified.AdvertisementRussia restructured its military 10 years ago and dismantled a lot of the mobilization system, which was expensive to maintain and seen as largely unnecessary — and now it is showing, said Dara Massicot, a senior policy researcher at the Rand Corp.Massicot said there is little reliable public information about how Russia intends to train and deploy the draftees, making it too early to say exactly what kind of impact the mobilization is likely to have. She said the new troops are likely to have poor combat capability but could free up personnel in the rear to fight at the front, assuming there are soldiers to free up.“Creating a tank battalion out of these guys is going to go how we all would expect,” Massicot said. But if they are used in an auxiliary or noncombat role, she said, they could help Moscow hold on to territory.AdvertisementThe situation has demonstrated the limits of Putin’s ability to control the functions of his own government and military.“One of the things that we should have learned through this is that there are things that Putin doesn’t know — one of which is how good is his army, how effective is his state,” Greene said. “He has never tried this stuff before. So, he is not going to know how effectively it’s going to work until push comes to shove.”",Paul Sonne,Putin faces limits of his military power as Ukraine recaptures land

Ukrainian forces accelerated their advances on territories occupied by Russian troops and their separatist proxies, liberating towns in the southern Kherson region while also moving toward Luhansk in the east. After taking back Russian-controlled areas in the northeast Kharkiv region in a lightning campaign last month, Ukraine is hoping to remove Russia’s last footholds north and west of the Dnieper River, which will cripple the Kremlin’s already-waning ability to mount its own campaign on the strategic Ukrainian port of Odesa.“The Ukrainian armed forces commanders in the south and east are throwing problems at the Russian chain of command faster than the Russians can effectively respond,” said a Western official who briefed my colleagues about sensitive security information on the condition of anonymity. “And this is compounding the existing dysfunction within the Russian invasion force.”AdvertisementMorale and unit cohesion among the Russian brigades on the front are in tatters, with Ukrainian strikes on Russian ammunition and supply depots exacting a critical toll.

Some estimates found that 700,000 people — about 1 out of every 200 Russians — left the country in the space of less than two weeks since President Vladimir Putin ordered a “partial mobilization” of troops to reinforce his faltering invasion.The current state of play follows the Ukrainian recapture over the weekend of the city of Lyman, a key transit hub in eastern Donetsk. My colleagues journeyed there and spoke to locals as gunfire echoed in the distance. “Well, they’re either hunting pheasants, rabbits or Russians,” a retired schoolteacher quipped to them.Refuting annexation, Ukrainian forces push on from Lyman toward LuhanskPutin is trying to create his own facts on the ground. By Tuesday, motions had passed through Russia’s rubber-stamp parliament accepting the “accession treaties” Putin signed last week announcing the absorption of the Ukrainian regions of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia — all only partially occupied by Russian troops — into the Russian Federation. Russian-backed separatists in these four so-called republics had staged sham referendums to join Russia, outraging Kyiv and the international community.AdvertisementThe annexations only heighten the awkwardness for Kremlin officials, who as of yet could not detail where their borders lay as Ukrainian forces pushed through wilting Russian defenses.“Ukraine’s victory in Lyman will remain symbolic for the message it sent to the Kremlin: Putin’s annexation of the partly occupied regions was a farce,” my colleagues reported from the front lines. “Lyman was very much part of the lands that Putin claimed in a ceremony in Moscow on Friday, but just one day later, his soldiers left in a hurry — some dying on the way out.”Putin, of course, seems undeterred. His 37-minute speech Friday waved away criticism of Russia’s violations of international law and reprised his conspiratorial raging at the agendas of the United States and its European allies. He called for “a liberation anti-colonial movement against unipolar hegemony,” casting the annexations as an act of resistance to the “parasitic,” “neocolonial system” of the West, while also detailing the historical legacies of “plunder” and “genocide” carried out by various Western powers in centuries past.Today I spoke with President Zelenskyy to underscore that the U.S. will never recognize Russia’s purported annexation of Ukrainian territory.I reaffirmed my commitment to continue supporting Ukraine, including through today's new $625 million security assistance package. pic.twitter.com/0ZP2uopn4n— President Biden (@POTUS) October 4, 2022

As war fails, Russia’s authoritarian grandmaster backs himself into a cornerOn one hand, none of this rhetoric should be surprising. Such grousing is standard for Putin, who always seeks to place Russia on equal footing with the United States and its partners. Moreover, dogmatic “anti-imperialism” was stock-in-trade under the Soviet Union, which for decades sought to back and mobilize revolutionaries and leftists across the colonized or decolonizing world. In some instances, such as its support of opposition to the apartheid regime in South Africa, the Kremlin found itself on the right side of history far sooner than its adversaries in the West.AdvertisementBut all of this is ephemeral when set against the war unleashed by Putin, the documented atrocities conducted by his troops in Ukraine, and the overarching colonial project of using brute force to bring Ukrainians to heel while denying their nation-state’s very right to exist. “Putin is apparently oblivious to the absurdity of condemning imperialism while at the same time committing the most brazen act of imperial aggression in modern European history,” noted Peter Dickinson of the Atlantic Council.Putin is also silent about his own nation’s ruthless, bloody history of imperial conquest, let alone the horrors of Stalinism. While Western empires were setting up their systems of exploitation and extraction in various parts of the world, Russia’s czars were waging merciless wars of expansion in places not far from the current battles in Ukraine.“In 1818, when Russian forces attempted to conquer the Northern Caucasus, they encountered a population that refused to be subdued,” wrote Lynne Hartnett, a historian of Russia at Villanova University. “In answer to the guerrilla warfare that the indigenous population unleashed against the invaders, Russia burned villages to the ground, incinerated forests and took civilians as hostages.”Advertisement“There’s no attempt to deal with the oppressions of the Russian and Soviet past, the way the Kremlin repeatedly colonizes, ethnically cleanses, deports, starves and mass murders other nations, and the way it kills and arrests and humiliates masses of its own people too in labor camps, gulags, and the killing cellars of the KGB,” wrote Soviet-born British journalist Peter Pomerantsev, nodding to how Putin last year shuttered Memorial, a major Russian civil society organization that investigated the misdeeds of the Soviet past.Instead, Putin is on his own revanchist journey of restoring Russia’s empire. “He is ‘gathering in the lands’ as did his personal icons — the great Russian tsars — and overturning the legacy of Lenin, the Bolsheviks, and The Post-Cold War settlement,” wrote Fiona Hill and Angela Stent in the latest issue of Foreign Affairs. “In this way, Putin wants Russia to be the one exception to the inexorable rise and fall of imperial states.”For now — as his citizens seek to flee, his nation’s geopolitical isolation deepens and his military teeters — Putin’s mission seems more delusional than ever.",Ishaan Tharoor,Annexations show the depth of Putin’s imperial delusion
20,"Iran’s bold and bracing protests, stretching across an unsettled nation for more than two weeks, have been marked by defiant acts and daring slogans that challenge the country’s clerical leadership and its stifling restrictions on all aspects of social life.Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine.ArrowRightGovernment security forces have responded with deadly, uncompromising force. At least 52 people have been killed, according to Amnesty International, including women and children.The ongoing protests began in response to the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman who fell into a coma after being detained by the country’s hated “morality police.”In videos that began circulating online Oct. 2, armed police and protesters are seen running near Sharif University while explosions can be heard. (Video: Reuters)Anger against Iran’s ‘morality police’ erupts after death of Mahsa AminiIran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, claimed Monday that the unrest had been instigated by foreign powers and blamed protesters for the violence: “The ones who attack the police are leaving Iranian citizens defenseless against thugs, robbers and extortionists,” he said.AdvertisementKhamenei gave his full backing to the security forces, signaling a further wave of repression could be coming.To understand the extent of the government’s crackdown against protesters, The Washington Post analyzed hundreds of videos and photographs of protests, spoke to human rights activists, interviewed protesters and reviewed data collected by internet monitoring groups. The Post geolocated videos of protests in at least 22 cities — from the Kurdistan region, where the protests began, to Bandar Abbas, a port city on the Persian Gulf, to Rasht on the Caspian coast.The investigation focused on three key tactics used by the government to crush the protests — the apparent use of live ammunition by security forces, targeted arrests and the throttling of internet service.The Post interviewed protesters in Marivan, Balo and Tehran, who corroborated the findings. All spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals by security forces.AdvertisementThe protester in Marivan, a city of 50,000 people in the Kurdish west, described the scene on Saturday as akin to martial law. “All of the security forces were out. … I would say more than 1,000. They filled every square and intersection and major street.”Indiscriminate forceThe Post geolocated videos from seven cities that appear to show security forces shooting at protesters. Though it was impossible to verify the type of rounds used from the videos alone, “it’s extremely likely [security forces] were using live rounds against protesters during the events of recent days and weeks,” said N.R. Jenzen-Jones, the director of Armament Research Services, who reviewed the videos for The Post.Videos show Iran’s violent crackdown as protests intensifySecurity forces have been firing indiscriminately at demonstrators since the start of the protests, 1500 Tasvir, an anti-government monitoring group, told The Post. Videos recorded Sept. 17, according to 1500 Tasvir, in the Kurdish city of Saqqez — Amini’s hometown — appear to corroborate the claim. They show protesters marching through the center of the city on the same day as Amini’s funeral. They are quickly dispersed by officers on motorcycles firing in the direction of the crowd.A video posted on Sept. 17 shows an injured protester in Saqqez, Iran, being rushed to a medical facility. (Video: Twitter)A video filmed on side streets nearby captures a frantic group carrying a young man, unconscious and covered in blood, into a medical facility.AdvertisementAnalysts with Janes, a defense intelligence provider, also reviewed videos for The Post and determined that at least two videos likely showed the use of live ammunition.Videos posted online Sept. 20 in Rasht and Sept. 23 in Tehran show officers firing at crowds, using what are likely live rounds, according to analysts. (Video: 1500 Tasvir; Telegram)In a video posted Sept. 20, officers fire pistols in the air and at retreating crowds in the northern city of Rasht. The officer to the left is likely firing off live rounds into the air where there is no point of impact, according to Andrew Galer, head of land platforms and weapons at Janes.A video posted Sept. 23 in Tehran shows a man in army fatigues calmly taking aim and shooting a variant of an AK-47 assault rifle, according to Janes. While blank cartridges are made for the AK-47, Janes said, it has no record of any less-lethal or riot-control rounds being made for the gun. “On probability, [these] are assessed as being live rounds,” Galer concluded.AdvertisementA leaked document from the general headquarters of Iran’s armed forces on Sept. 21 — obtained by Amnesty International and reviewed by The Post — ordered security forces to “severely confront” protesters. Another document, issued two days later by the commander of armed forces in Mazandaran province, went even further, ordering security forces to “confront mercilessly, and while going as far as causing deaths, any unrest by rioters and anti-Revolutionaries.”The protesters interviewed by The Post in the western cities of Marivan and Balo told The Post they had witnessed security forces firing on demonstrators.“Security forces fired directly at the people in Darai Square,” said the protester in Marivan, describing a crackdown on Oct. 1. “They had no intention to arrest or to calm the situation. They only wanted to shoot.”AdvertisementThe protester from Balo described a chilling “ambush” on Sept. 21 by the Basij, a paramilitary force under the command of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps. “Members of the Basij were already on the roofs of nearby buildings,” the protester said. “They started shooting in the air, and the crowd scattered.” Other Basij fighters came out onto the streets, shooting into the air at first, and then directly at the fleeing protesters, he told The Post.Two young men were killed in the barrage of bullets, he said — one was shot in the stomach, another in the throat. Their deaths were corroborated by Hengaw, a Kurdish rights group, and videos from their funerals were shared with The Post.ArrestsThe Post verified and geolocated five videos showing security forces violently arresting protesters in five cities across Iran over the past two weeks. The videos show security forces often detaining protesters away from the crowds, on side streets. Some arresting officers traveled on motorbikes, allowing them to quickly descend on demonstrators and whisk them away.AdvertisementThe protester in Balo recounted members of the Basij making arrests in the middle of the night on Sept. 21 and using tear gas to force civilians out of their homes.“They [the Basij] come with civilian clothes and cover their faces. It creates fear,” the protester said.As of Sept. 30, security forces had arrested at least 50 people in Balo, and the majority are still in custody, according to the protester. “There are no more protests in Balo because of the fear they created,” the protester said. “After 10 p.m., you don’t see anybody out.”Prisoners in Iran are routinely subjected to torture and other inhumane treatment, rights groups have found, and families often struggle to get information about loved ones who have been detained. “The documented acts of torture and other ill-treatment raise concerns that hundreds of people arrested since the start of the protests risk similar treatment in custody,” Amnesty said.Videos shared by anti-government monitoring group 1500 Tasvir and verified by The Post show violent arrests of protesters in cities across Iran. (Video: 1500 Tasvir)In a video from Gorgan, the capital of Golestan province in the northeast, officers on motorcycles surround and beat a protester in front of a closed storefront at night before arresting him.AdvertisementIn Tehran, a video shows officers walking a man in a black shirt, his hands behind his back, to a busy downtown street. They then force him onto the back of a motorcycle driven by an officer.In another video from Kermanshah, in the west, a protester surrounded by officers on motorcycles is placed into a police vehicle and driven away.Internet restrictionsIran has frequently employed internet disruptions during times of unrest, making it more difficult for protesters to communicate with one another and with the outside world. But the cuts over the past two weeks have been more targeted and appear to show a greater level of sophistication.Network traffic data from Iran to Google’s web search product shows significant disruptions in the evenings beginning Sept. 21, the bloodiest night of protests so far and a crucial turning point in the government’s response, according to Raha Bahreini, Amnesty’s Iran researcher. The majority of the deaths recorded by Amnesty took place Sept. 21.AdvertisementAccording to The Post’s analysis of internet data, traffic patterns show a cyclical nature to the disruptions, beginning every afternoon around 4 p.m. local time — the end of the Iranian workday, when most protests begin — and returning to normal levels after midnight.Instagram and WhatsApp, major platforms for sharing video, were also shut down Sept. 21, according to NetBlocks, a London-based group that monitors global internet access. These restrictions have coincided with sudden decreases in visual evidence coming out of Iran.The Post tracked the number of protest videos coming from a Telegram account that regularly posts and circulates clips. The count revealed the direct impact of the throttling of internet connectivity, with the number dropping from around 80 new clips on Sept. 21 to just 40 the day after.1500 Tasvir told The Post that in the first few days of the protests, the group received more than 3,000 videos per day. After the increase in internet disruptions, that number dropped dramatically, to about 100 to 200 videos per day.The protesters who spoke to The Post confirmed the internet restrictions observed in the data.“Most of the people don’t have internet at home,” said the protester in Balo. “They only have internet on their sim card, and it’s cut between 4 and 10 p.m. And even when it comes back, it’s still very bad.”That account was echoed by the protester in Marivan: “The internet gets cut every day at 3 or 4 p.m. and doesn’t come back until around midnight or 1 a.m.,” the protester said. “None of the big apps like Instagram or WhatsApp or Telegram work.”As Iran protests persist, supreme leader blames foreigners for unrestDespite the violence by security forces — and the daily blackouts — protesters are still in the streets. To some, the crackdown has only made them more determined. The protester in Tehran recalled a scene from a recent protest, where he and his compatriots dragged trash cans into the street and set them on fire. As security forces approached on motorcycles, they began to chant:“We didn’t have our people killed in order to compromise.”Kareem Fahim in Istanbul contributed to this report.",Joyce Sohyun Lee,Tactics of repression: How Iran is trying to stop Mahsa Amini protests
21,"Yusuf al-Qaradawi, an influential Islamic cleric whose views reached across the Arab world on Qatar’s Al Jazeera network, backing the Arab Spring uprisings and denouncing al-Qaeda while facing condemnation from some leaders who saw him as a threat, died Sept. 26 in Qatar’s capital, Doha. He was 96.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightThousands of mourners attended Mr. Qaradawi’s funeral in Doha on Sept. 27, a day after his death was announced by his family and state-run media in Qatar, where Mr. Qaradawi had lived in exile for decades after leaving his native Egypt. No cause was given, but the cleric had been largely out of the public eye since falling ill with the coronavirus last year.Mr. Qaradawi’s ideology was largely a self-made amalgam of Islamic schools — some moderate-leaning and others backing violence as a necessary tool — giving him a reputation as an independent voice that could sway in various, and at times apparently contradictory, directions.AdvertisementAt the core of his beliefs was an adherence to the Muslim Brotherhood, a group forged during his boyhood in Egypt that held Islam as a foundation for government, education and other key aspects of civil life. That itself made him a hugely polarizing figure.The Brotherhood is seen as the enemy of many Western-allied regimes across the Muslim world, which made Mr. Qaradawi a pariah for leaders in places such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.In 2015, an Egyptian court sentenced Mr. Qaradawi in absentia to death. Two years later, Qatar faced a full-scale blockade by Egypt and several Persian Gulf neighbors, partly for providing haven for Mr. Qaradawi and others.The pressure and persecution only elevated his stature among many followers. He wrote more than 100 books, including some highly regarded volumes on Islamic jurisprudence, and helped lead a website, Islamonline.net, that offered what some called e-fatwas on politics and personal conundrums.AdvertisementBut his platform on Al Jazeera gave him the self-crafted title of “global mufti,” bringing him into hundreds of millions of homes. He delivered sermons, gave interviews and hosted a call-in show, “Shariah and Life,” that dispensed guidance on topics ranging from euthanasia by Muslims (not acceptable), women’s role in politics (fine as long as traditional Islamic codes are followed) and whether it’s permitted to sterilize cats (yes, if done humanely).Maverick cleric is a hit on Arab TVHis multimedia reach gave his bigger pronouncements resonance unmatched by nearly any other Islamic scholar. He denounced al-Qaeda and the 9/11 attacks, but also declared that suicide bombings by Palestinians against Israelis were “heroic martyrdom” and that retaliation against U.S.-led forces in Iraq was legitimate defense. In 2009, he described the Holocaust as part of “divine punishment” against Jews.In 2016, Mr. Qaradawi revised his fatwa on Palestinian suicide attacks, saying they were no longer permissible because Palestinians had other options to resist Israel.“He is regarded by many as a ‘moderate’ — a possible bridge between the West and Islam,” Tommaso Virgili, now a researcher on Islamic issues at the Berlin Social Science Center, wrote in 2018. “However, many of his tenets show very little ‘moderation.’”Mr. Qaradawi dismissed contentions that his views fed tensions in the region. He described Muslims as part of a “single nation” that is not at odds with the West, but is also compelled to fight back against perceived injustices.Advertisement“I was the first who condemned the crimes of Sept. 11, even before it was clear to many that al-Qaeda was behind the attacks,” he told Der Spiegel in 2005. “There is certainly a difference if violence is used in a blind terrorist act or if it is used in rebellion against a foreign occupying force.”The interviewer asked if Mr. Qaradawi felt the Muslim world is morally superior.“We condemn the excessive materialism of the West. We deplore the loss of solidarity and brotherliness, the decay of morals and the daily violations of human dignity,” he replied. “God has disappeared.”Religious educationYusuf al-Qaradawi was born on Sept. 9, 1926, in the Nile Delta village of Saft Turab, the only child in a farming family. When he was 2, his father died and he was sent to live with his uncle, who became impressed with the boy’s ability to memorize long passages of the Quran.AdvertisementMr. Qaradawi was enrolled in a religious school in Tanta, about 60 miles northwest of Cairo, to prepare for Cairo’s al-Azhar University, regarded as the center of Sunni Muslim scholarship.In Tanta, Mr. Qaradawi’s first encountered the ideas of the Muslim Brotherhood, which was fast becoming a political force in Egypt between the world wars. Mr. Qaradawi often recounted how he was spellbound by a lecture from the group’s founder, Hassan al-Banna.The Muslim Brotherhood soon faced crackdowns by authorities worried about its rise. In 1948, it became a hunted group after a follower assassinated Egypt’s prime minister, Mahmoud an-Nukrashi Pasha. Banna was then killed by suspected government loyalists.Mr. Qaradawi graduated from al-Azhar in 1953 and became active in Brotherhood affairs. He was arrested and jailed at least three times, during which he claimed he was tortured. In the early 1960s, he left Egypt for Qatar, where the ruling dynasty offered him sanctuary and a position as an Islamic scholar.AdvertisementIn Qatar, Mr. Qaradawi publicly renounced some of the more radical elements of the movement. He rejected the teachings of renowned Muslim Brotherhood firebrand Sayyid Qutb, whose support of armed struggle helped give the ideological underpinnings for al-Qaeda, Egypt’s Islamic Jihad and, later, some leaders of the Islamic State.The Arab Spring protests that began in 2010 seemed a capstone to his calls for political reforms across the Muslim world — although he was always careful not to encourage any dissent that would upset his patrons in Qatar.“Our manner of protesting should reflect sense and reason,” Mr. Qaradawi said in a sermon in Doha in 2012.He used Al Jazeera to rally behind groups that overthrew and killed Libyan dictator Col. Moammar Gaddafi in 2011, and urged on demonstrations against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who managed to maintain control with the help from allies Iran and Russia.AdvertisementIn Egypt, Mr. Qaradawi made a triumphant return after President Hosni Mubarak was overthrown by protests in early 2011. “Don’t let anyone steal this revolution from you,” he told crowds in Cairo’s Tahrir Square. “Those hypocrites who will put on a new face that suits them.”His prominence in Islamist circles rose even higher when presidential elections in 2012 brought Muslim Brotherhood stalwart Mohamed Morsi to power. But many Egyptian activists and secular reformists strongly opposed Morsi and his allies, including Mr. Qaradawi.Egypt's ousted strongman Hosni Mubarak dies at 91Egypt’s military ousted Morsi in 2013 and opened a relentless purge against the Brotherhood. Mr. Qaradawi and his seven children were declared terrorists. His daughter Ola al-Qaradawi and her husband were arrested in 2017.In 2017, in an essay published 100 days after his daughter’s arrest, Mr. Qaradawi offered words of encouragement and said Egypt was “punishing your father through you.”Advertisement“A day would feel like eternity,” he wrote. “These days of injustice will, if God wills it, become part of your past.” (She was released in late 2021, but her husband remains jailed.)In addition to Ola, Mr. Qaradawi is survived by his third wife, Aicha; three other daughters, Siham, Ilham and Asmaa; three sons, Mohamed, Abdel-Rahman and Osama; and 12 grandchildren. Many of his children studied at British or U.S. universities.Mr. Qaradawi spent his recent years working on a unified compilation of his books and representing various organizations, including the International Union of Muslim Scholars.In a 2004 interview, Mr. Qaradawi reflected on the power of television to give him a voice that few other could match. He was unabashed about seizing the chance.“There are some preachers who can shake the very pulpit but cannot write. I know some sheikhs like that,” he told Arab Media & Society in 2004. “Some people can write very well; but put them up in the pulpit and they stutter and stammer. They can’t perform. … I think Allah has granted to me something of both.”",Brian Murphy,"Yusuf al-Qaradawi, influential Islamic scholar, dies at 96"

23,"ZAPORIZHZHIA, Ukraine — Alone in his apartment in the Russian-occupied city of Enerhodar in southeastern Ukraine, nuclear plant security guard Serhiy Shvets looked out his kitchen window in late May and saw gunmen approaching on the street below. When his buzzer rang, he was sure he was about to die.Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine.ArrowRightShvets, a former soldier in Ukraine’s military who was loyal to Kyiv, knew the gunmen would either kill or abduct and torture him. He thought briefly about recording a farewell to his family, who had fled to safety abroad, but instead lit a cigarette and grabbed his gun.Six Russian soldiers broke down his door and opened fire, which he returned. Wounded in the hand, thigh, ear and stomach, Shvets began to lose consciousness. Before he did, he heard the commander of the group tell his men to cease fire and call an ambulance.AdvertisementShvets, who survived the shooting, is among workers from the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant recounting their fears of being abducted and tortured or killed by Russian forces occupying the facility and the city of Enerhodar. Ukrainian officials say the Russians have sought to intimidate the staff into keeping the plant running, through beatings and other abuse. but also to punish those who express support for Kyiv.On Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin declared that Russia was taking ownership of the plant. With his decree, he ordered the creation of a state company to manage the facility and said all workers now need Russian permission to work there.Ukraine’s state nuclear operator, Energoatom, said it considers Putin’s decree “worthless” and “absurd.” It said the plant would continue to be operated by Energoatom as part of the Ukrainian energy system.AdvertisementA GOOD LIFE BEFORE THE WARLife was good for employees of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant before the Russian invasion of Feb. 24. They were guaranteed a financially secure and stable life for their families.And even though Ukraine still bears the psychological scars of the world’s worst atomic accident at Chernobyl in 1986, the Zaporizhzhia plant — Europe’s largest nuclear facility with its six reactors — provided jobs for about 11,000 people, making Enerhodar with its prewar population of 53,000 one of the wealthiest cities in the region.But after Russia occupied the city early in the war, that once-comfortable life turned into a nightmare.The invaders overran the ZNPP, about 6 kilometers (nearly 4 miles) from Enerhodar, but kept the Ukrainian staff in place to run it. Both sides accused the other of shelling the plant, damaging power lines connecting it to the grid and raising international alarm for its safety. Ukrainian officials say the Russians used the plant as a shield as they shelled nearby towns.AdvertisementReports of intimidation of the staff and abductions began trickling out over the summer. Rafael Mariano Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N.’s atomic watchdog, told The Associated Press about reports of violence between the Russians and the Ukrainian staff.Grossi traveled to Kyiv on Wednesday and will be in Russia later to hold consultations on Moscow’s intention to take over the plant and to continue his push for a safety zone to be established around it, the IAEA said in a statement.About 4,000 ZNPP workers have fled. Those who stayed cited threats of kidnap and torture — underscored by the abduction Friday of plant director Ihor Murashov, who was seized and blindfolded by Russian forces on his way home from work.He was freed Monday after being forced to make false statements on camera, according to Petro Kotin, head of Energoatom. He told AP Murashov was released at the edge of Russian-controlled territory and walked about 15 kilometers (9 miles) to a Ukrainian-held area.Advertisement“I would say it was mental torture,” Kotin said of what Murashov suffered. “He had to say that all the shelling on the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant was made by Ukrainian forces and that he is a Ukrainian spy ... in contact with Ukrainian special forces.”Enerhodar’s exiled Mayor Dmytro Orlov, who spoke to Murashov after his release, said the plant official told him he had spent two days “in solitary confinement in the basement, with handcuffs and a bag on his head. His condition can hardly be called normal.”President Volodymyr Zelenskyy described Murashov’s abduction as “yet another manifestation of absolutely uncovered Russian terror.”‘TERRIBLE THINGS HAPPEN THERE’More than 1,000 people, including plant workers, were abducted from Enerhodar, although some have been released, Orlov estimated. He fled to Zaporizhzhia, the nearest city under Ukrainian control, after refusing to cooperate with the Russians. Kotin estimated that 100-200 of those abducted are still being held.AdvertisementOrlov said the first abduction was March 19, when Russians seized his deputy, Ivan Samoidiuk, whose whereabouts remain unknown. The abductions then accelerated, he said.“Mostly, they took people with a pro-Ukrainian position, who were actively involved in the resistance movement,” he said.Orlov alleged they were tortured at various locations in Enerhodar, including at the city’s police station, in basements elsewhere and even in the ZNPP itself.“Terrible things happen there,” he said. “People who managed to come out say there was torture with electric currents, beatings, rape, shootings. ... Some people didn’t survive.”Similar sites were seen by AP journalists in parts of the Kharkiv region abandoned by Russian troops after a Ukrainian counteroffensive. In the city of Izium, an AP investigation uncovered 10 separate torture sites.AdvertisementPlant worker Andriy Honcharuk died in a hospital on July 3 shortly after the Russians released him, beaten and unconscious, for refusing to follow their orders at the facility, Orlov said.Oleksii, a worker who said he was responsible for controlling the plant’s turbines and reactor compartment, fled Enerhodar in June when he learned Russian troops were looking for him. He asked not to be identified by his full name for fear of reprisal.“It was psychologically difficult,” Oleksii told the AP in Kyiv. “You go to the station and see the occupiers there. You come to your workplace already depressed.”Many plant employees “visited the basements” and were tortured there, he said.“Graves appeared in the forest that surrounds the city. That is, everyone understands that something horrible is happening,” he said. “They abduct people for their pro-Ukrainian position, or if they find any Telegram groups on their phone. This is enough for them to take a person away.”AdvertisementAnother employee who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of his safety said he was unafraid of working at the plant despite the shelling but decided to flee in September after colleagues were seized. He said Russians visited his home twice while he was away, and the possibility of torture was too much for him.The plant’s last reactor was shut down in September to guard against a disaster from constant shelling, which cut reliable external power supplies needed for cooling and other safety systems. Kotin said the company could restart two of the reactors in a matter of days to protect safety installations as winter approaches and temperatures drop.But the power plant sits in one of four regions that Russia declares it has annexed, making its future uncertain.Kotin on Tuesday renewed his call for a “demilitarized zone” around the plant, where two IAEA experts are based.Advertisement‘FREEDOM OR DEATH’For Serhiy Shvets, whose apartment was raided May 23, it was only a matter of time before the Russians came for him during the occupation of Enerhodar, he said. He had signed up to serve in Ukraine’s territorial defense forces shortly after the invasion and had sent his wife and other relatives abroad for safety.He said the Russian forces who shot him called the ambulance “so I could die in the hospital.”Doctors initially gave him a 5% chance of survival after he lost nearly two-thirds of his blood. But following several operations, he was well enough to leave Enerhodar in July and is living in Zaporizhzhia.Shvets, whose right hand is in a metal brace, quietly exhaled from pain as he moved it and said the only thing he regrets now is that he is too disabled to fight.“I’m a descendant from Zaporozhian Cossacks,” he said, referring to his ancestors who lived on the territory of Ukraine from the 15th to 18th centuries and defended it from invaders. “There was no such thing as surrender for them — just freedom or death.”He added: “Why would I want such a life if I don’t have my freedom?”___Yuras Karmanau in Tallinn, Estonia, contributed.___Follow AP’s coverate of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",Hanna Arhirova | AP,"Ukraine nuclear workers recount abuse, threats from Russians"
24,"STOCKHOLM — Three scientists were jointly awarded this year’s Nobel Prize in chemistry on Wednesday for developing a way of “snapping molecules together” that can be used to explore cells, map DNA and design drugs that can target diseases such as cancer more precisely.Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine.ArrowRightAmericans Carolyn R. Bertozzi and K. Barry Sharpless, and Danish scientist Morten Meldal were cited for their work on click chemistry and bioorthogonal reactions.“It’s all about snapping molecules together,” said Johan Aqvist, a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences that announced the winners at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm.Sharpless, 81, who previously won a Nobel Prize in 2001 and is now the fifth person to receive the award twice, first proposed the idea of connecting molecules using chemical “buckles” around the turn of the millennium, Aqvist said.Advertisement“The problem was to find good chemical buckles,” he said. “They have to react with each other easily and specifically.”Meldal, 68, based at the University of Copenhagen and Sharpless, who is affiliated with Scripps Research in California, independently found the first such candidates that would easily snap together with each other but not with other molecules, leading to applications in the manufacture of medicines and polymers.Bertozzi, 55, who is based at Stanford University “took click chemistry to a new level,” the Nobel panel said, by finding a way to make the process work inside living organisms without disrupting them.The goal is “doing chemistry inside human patients to make sure that drugs go to the right place and stay away from the wrong place,” she said, speaking by phone at a news conference following the announcement.AdvertisementThe award was a shock, she said. “I’m still not entirely positive that it’s real, but it’s getting realer by the minute.”Later, speaking to The Associated Press by Zoom, Bertozzi said one of the first people she called after being wakened by the call around 2 a.m. was her father, William Bertozzi, a retired physicist and night owl, who was still awake watching TV.“Dad, turn down the TV, I have something to tell you,” she said she told him. After she assured him nothing was wrong, he guessed the news. “You won it, didn’t you?”One of three daughters, Bertozzi said she was “fortunate because I grew up with parents that were very supportive, evangelical almost, about having their girls participate in the sciences.”Bertozzi, who is paid by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, which also supports The Associated Press’ Health and Science Department, said she was grateful for the energy and enthusiasm that a Nobel Prize win will inject into the field.AdvertisementMeldal said he received the call from the Nobel panel about half an hour before the public announcement. “They ... told me not to tell anyone,” he told the AP, adding that he just sat in his office, shaking a bit. “This is a huge honor.”Meldal started out as an engineer, “but I wanted to understand the world so I thought chemistry would give me the solutions.”Jon Lorsch, director of the U.S. National Institute of General Medical Sciences, which supports the work of Bertozzi and Sharpless, described click chemistry and bioorthagonal chemistry as “sort of like molecular Lego — you have a group on one molecule that specifically attaches to a group on another molecule,” like Lego clicking together.“That makes it possible to attach molecules in very specific pre-defined ways,” he said, and gives scientists a very precise tool to build complex new molecules that can be used for drugs, synthetic materials and other uses.AdvertisementHowever, the first iteration of click chemistry could not be used with living cells. “The original click chemistry used copper as a catalyst to join molecules,” Lorsch said. “But the trouble is that copper is toxic to most living systems at higher concentrations.”Bertozzi then devised a way to jumpstart the reactions without copper or other toxic solvents — broadening the applications of the molecular Lego to human and animal tissues.“Being able to work without dangerous solvents, opened many news doors — it enabled scientists to work on new types of reactions that actually take place within the human body,” said Angela Wilson, president of the American Chemical Society.For example, that has allowed scientists to attach dyes to cancer cells to track their movements and analyze how they differ from healthy tissue.AdvertisementWilson believes that the advances of this year’s Nobel laureates “will allow more individualized medicine in the future because we can really track things much better within the human body.”M.G. Finn, a chemist now at Georgia Tech who collaborated with Sharpless on his Nobel-winning work, said click chemistry’s use in biology and drug development was still “at its infancy,” with more exciting discoveries to come.Meldal agreed.Winning the Nobel is “very much an opportunity ... when you get this kind of award to argue for our young people to take chemistry as a discipline at the university,” he said at a news conference in Copenhagen. “Chemistry is the solution to many of our challenges.”Last year the prize was awarded to scientists Benjamin List and David W.C. MacMillan for finding an ingenious and environmentally cleaner way to build molecules that the Nobel panel said is “already benefiting humankind greatly.”AdvertisementA week of Nobel Prize announcements kicked off Monday with Swedish scientist Svante Paabo receiving the award in medicine for unlocking secrets of Neanderthal DNA that provided key insights into our immune system.Three scientists won the prize in physics Tuesday. Frenchman Alain Aspect, American John F. Clauser and Austrian Anton Zeilinger had shown that tiny particles can retain a connection with each other even when separated, a phenomenon known as quantum entanglement, that can be used for specialized computing and to encrypt information.The awards continue with literature on Thursday. The 2022 Nobel Peace Prize will be announced Friday and the economics award on Monday.The prizes carry a cash award of 10 million Swedish kronor (nearly $900,000) and will be handed out on Dec. 10.

25,"CAIRO — The U.S. envoy to Yemen on Wednesday blamed rebel Houthi leaders for the recent failure to extend the country’s cease-fire agreement, accusing them of making last-minute ‘maximalist demands’ that derailed constructive negotiations.Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine.ArrowRightYemen’s warring sides failed to reach an agreement to extend the nationwide truce Sunday, threatening to reignite the country’s bloody civil war after a six-month cessation in front-line fighting.During a news conference, U.S. Special Envoy to Yemen Tim Lenderking said the Houthis ‘hijacked’ the negotiations by suddenly demanding the salaries of their military and security personnel be paid before that of Yemeni civil servants. Lenderking did not provide any other reason for the failure of the negotiations.The U.N.-backed truce took effect in April, as the war entered its eighth year. The ruinous conflict began in 2014 when Iranian-backed Houthi forces seized the capital of Sanaa and much of northern Yemen, pushing the government into exile. In response, a Saudi Arabia-led coalition — which included the United Arab Emirates — intervened in 2015 to try to restore the internationally recognized government to power.AdvertisementFollowing the passing of the cease-fire deadline, small exchanges of fire were reported in the western governorate of Al Dhalea, while military reinforcements were deployed by both sides in the front-line cities of Marib and Taiz. The reports post-cease-fire could not be immediately confirmed by The Associated Press.A Houthi official told the AP on Sunday that the U.N.’s unwillingness to provide written guarantees for several of the group’s demands proved the major obstruction to negotiations. The demands included the payment of employee salaries and the opening of Sanaa airport and the Houthi-held port of Hodeidah, the official said, who spoke on the condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to brief the media.April’s truce had originally established the partial opening of the capital’s airport and the Red Sea port of Hodeida, as well as the lifting of the Houthi blockade on Taiz, the country’s third largest city. However, disagreements over the opening and control of Taiz’s key entry roads has meant the city has remained under a Houthi-imposed siege. Both sides have reported several violations of April’s cease-fire agreement.AdvertisementAnalysts say the Houthis’ withdrawal from cease-fire talks is a reflection of the Shia group’s belief that they had greater political leverage in recent cease-fire talks and were more willing to return to war.However, Farea Muslimi, an associate fellow at British think tank Chatham House specializing in Yemen, told The Associated Press it is still likely Houthi leaders will be forced back to the negotiation table.“In not backing down from their position, the Houthis face expanded military pressure from U.S. and Saudi allies, along with greater internal economic difficulties,” he said.The Houthi forces have deployed an increasingly effective arsenal of weapons against Saudi Arabia and other rivals in recent years, including cruise missiles and drones, akin to those manufactured by their major backer Iran. Many of these larger weapons types were displayed in a Houthi military parade in late September. The Saudi-led coalition remains the dominant aerial force and has launched thousands of airstrikes on Houthi positions since 2015, resulting in the deaths of thousands of civilians, rights groups say.AdvertisementHouthi forces are also responsible for civilian casualties. Officers from their military have previously admitted to The Associated Press of recruiting children into their ranks arguing that boys as young as 10 are considered men.Meanwhile, factional infighting within the anti-Houthi coalition has surfaced in the country’s southern provinces. In August, United Arab Emirates-supported militia groups seized vital southern oil and gas fields controlled by other forces fighting with the Saudi-led coalition. Clashes between them and other forces from within the alliance have killed dozens.On Tuesday, The U.N. joined scores of other non-governmental organizations and international aid groups calling for Yemen’s warring parties to extend the truce and “build on the gains achieved over the last six months.”AdvertisementThe conflict, which in recent years turned into a regional proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran, has killed in excess of 150,000 people, including over 14,500 civilians, according to The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project. The fighting has thrown Yemen into one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises, pushing it into deeper poverty and near famine.“Yemen needs not just a military cease-fire, but a truce with hunger,” said Muslimi.",Jack Jeffery | AP,US envoy blames Houthis for failure to extend cease-fire

Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency published video of Namazi boarding a Royal Oman air force jet in Tehran and later Omani state TV aired video of his arrival in Muscat.Namazi’s release is the first of an American by Iran since President Joe Biden took office, although his son, Siamak, 50, and several other Americans remain in Iranian custody. Baquer Namazi’s release on humanitarian grounds, which was brokered by the United Nations, comes as talks have stalled on reviving the tattered 2015 Iran nuclear deal with world powers.AdvertisementJared Genser, a Washington-based lawyer representing the Namazi family, shared a photo of Namazi on the plane in a suit and tie.“Today is a good day for the Namazi family, but the work is far from over,” Genser said in a statement. “We now need the United States and Iran to act expeditiously to reach an agreement that will finally bring all of the American hostages home.” In addition to Siamak Namazi, there are at least three other Americans still held by Iran.After a brief stop in Oman, Namazi will undergo a procedure at the local branch of the Cleveland Clinic in Abu Dhabi to clear a severe blockage to his left internal carotid artery, Genser said. That blockage put Namazi at high risk of a stroke.The Biden administration said it was pleased that Namazi had been allowed to leave Iran and his son had been given a temporary release from prison.Advertisement“We welcome reports that U.S. citizen Baquer Namazi has left Iran, and his son Siamak has been granted furlough from prison,” State Department deputy spokesman Vedant Patel said.He thanked “all of the countries and organizations that have helped our wrongfully detained citizens” but did not specifically mention Iran.Namazi is a former UNICEF official who served as governor of Iran’s oil-rich Khuzestan province under the U.S.-backed shah. He was arrested in 2016, apparently drawn to Iran over fears about his incarcerated son detained in 2015.He was placed under house arrest for medical reasons in 2018 but prevented from leaving Iran despite his family’s pleas that he travel to receive emergency heart surgery after suffering multiple hospitalizations.Last October, he underwent surgery in Iran to clear a blockage in an artery to the brain that his family and supporters described as life-threatening.AdvertisementSecurity forces arrested his son, Siamak Namazi, an advocate of closer ties between Iran and the West, while he was visiting Iran on a business trip.Both Namazis were sentenced to 10 years in prison in Iran on what the U.S. and U.N. say were trumped-up spying charges.The U.N.’s Working Group on Arbitrary Detention dismissed the cases against the two men, saying in 2017 their case is part of “an emerging pattern involving the arbitrary deprivation of liberty of dual nationals.”“There is no evidence either Mr. S. Namazi or Mr. B. Namazi had a criminal record, including in relation to national security offenses,” their report read. “There is nothing to indicate that they have ever acted against the national interests of the Islamic Republic of Iran.”___Lee reported from Washington.",Matthew Lee and Jon Gambrell | AP,"Detained Iranian-American, 85, leaves Iran for major surgery"

Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine.ArrowRightIf Debretsion Gebremichael attends the proposed talks between the Tigray and Ethiopian sides, it will be the highest-level effort yet to end the two-year war that has killed thousands of people from conflict and starvation. In a statement, he said he is ready to send a negotiating team but has questions about who else might take part, “considering that we were not consulted prior to the issuance of this invitation.”Ethiopia’s government has accepted the invitation, national security adviser Redwan Hussein said. In a separate statement, the government called it “consistent with the Ethiopian government’s prior positions” that talks be mediated by the AU and be held without preconditions. The statement does not say who might attend.AdvertisementThe letter from the chair of the AU Commission says the AU-convened talks would be “aimed at laying the foundation for a structured and sustained mediation” between the two sides toward a “durable resolution of the conflict.”The AU letter says the talks would be facilitated by AU special envoy and former Nigerian President Olesegun Obasanjo with the support of former Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta and former South African Deputy President Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka.A diplomat in Addis Ababa said representatives from the European Union, the United Nations and the regional Intergovernmental Authority on Development are expected to attend the talks as observers in support of the AU’s mediation team. The diplomat spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.The talks come more than a month after fighting in Tigray renewed following months of relative calm. Forces from neighboring Eritrea, allied with Ethiopia’s government, are again joining the fighting in what Tigray forces have described as a large-scale offensive.AdvertisementOn Tuesday, an airstrike hit the Tigray town of Adi Daero where displaced people were sheltering, a humanitarian worker who visited the site afterward told the AP. They described the scene as “total carnage” and said health workers reported more than 50 people killed. The worker spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.The Tigray region has been largely cut off from the world since the war began in November 2020, with more than 5 million people without basic services including electricity, phone, internet and banking. Medicines have run desperately low. On Thursday, the U.N. said trapped staffers were finally able to rotate out of the region for the first time since the fighting renewed.The fighting also has spilled over into Ethiopia’s neighboring regions of Amara and Afar as Tigray forces have tried to pressure the government, putting hundreds of thousands of other civilians at risk.AdvertisementUnited Nations-based investigators have said all sides have committed abuses.There is also deep suspicion on both sides. A member of the Tigray negotiation team, Tsadkan Gebretensae, told a U.S. think tank last week that “we have agreed on an African-led process, but that should not be carte blanche for the AU to impose what should be a peace process.”Tsadkan said Tigray representatives had met three times with Ethiopian authorities — in Djibouti and Seychelles — and he thanked the United States government for organizing the meetings, which he said produced a “clear proposal for a cessation of hostilities.” But after that, he asserted, the Tigray side was “betrayed.” He didn’t give details.The Tigray authorities seek unfettered access for humanitarian aid, the resumption of basic services, respect for constitutional boundary arrangements and the withdrawal of foreign forces, Tsadkan said.The Tigray authorities “will accept whatever comes out” of an impartial, agreed-upon peace process, he said.",Cara Anna | AP,"Ethiopia, Tigray head invited to peace talks in South Africa"

They were sparked by the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini after her arrest for allegedly violating the Islamic Republic’s strict dress code.Some of the Iranian demonstrators have publicly hacked off locks of hair at the protests, and the gesture has spread.Images of women elsewhere cutting their hair to show solidarity with Iranian women have gone viral — from Turkish singer Melek Mosso on stage last week, to women in Lebanon and Syria, to Swedish lawmaker Abir Al-Sahlani in the halls of the European Parliament in Strasbourg on Tuesday. A museum in Rome is collecting locks of hair to present to the Iranian Embassy.Advertisement“For women to cut their hair in Iran is a form of protest ... a symbol to stand against the mandatory hijab,” said Dorna Javan, an Iranian political scientist based in France and specialized in Iran. Such a visual gesture is a way for women across the world to rally around the Iranian women’s plight, she added.The video of Cotillard, Binoche and dozens of other women cutting off locks of their hair was released on an Instagram account, “soutienfemmesiran” — which translates as “support women in Iran.”“These women, these men are asking for our support. Their courage and their dignity obliges us,” said a post with the video.“We have decided to respond to the appeal made to us by cutting — us too — some of these locks.”Some of the other women who took part included actors Charlotte Rampling and Charlotte Gainsbourg, who was also filmed cutting off a lock of hair from the head of her mother, singer Jane Birkin.AdvertisementThis highly symbolic gesture also echoes Iranian history and folklore in which for women to chop their hair is a sign of protest. The Shahnameh (“The Book of Kings”), a national epic of Iran, Afghanistan and Tajikistan written by the Persian poet Ferdowsi between 977 and 1010 A.D., refers to a princess chopping her hair to protest against the death of her husband seen as unfair.“Women cutting their hair is an ancient Persian tradition also found in the Shahnameh, when the fury is stronger than the power of the oppressor,” tweeted Shara Atashi, an Iranian writer based in Wales.Researcher Javan described it as a “benevolent gesture,” and called for more robust political action from the international community to support Iranian protesters.“We can’t reduce the fight of Iranian women for their rights — which dates back to the second half of the 19th century — to the gesture of cutting their hair,” she said. “But these viral videos are a way to give an international impact to their fight.”___This story has been corrected to restore the correct spelling in the surname of Swedish lawmaker Abir Al-Sahlani.",Jade Le Deley and John Leicester | AP,France: Oscar winners cut off their hair for Iran protesters

The annexation followed Kremlin-orchestrated “referendums” in Ukraine that the Ukrainian government and the West have dismissed as illegitimate.The Russian president defended the validity of the vote, saying it’s “more than convincing” and “absolutely transparent and not subject to any doubt.”“This is objective data on people’s mood,” Putin said Wednesday at an event dedicated to teachers, adding that he was pleasantly “surprised” by the results.On the ground, Russia faced mounting setbacks, with Ukrainian forces retaking more and more land in the eastern and southern regions that Moscow now insists are its own.The precise borders of the areas Moscow is claiming remain unclear, but Putin has vowed to defend Russia’s territory — including the annexed regions — with any means at his military’s disposal, including nuclear weapons.AdvertisementShortly after Putin signed the annexation legislation, the head of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s office, Andriy Yermak, wrote on his Telegram channel that “the worthless decisions of the terrorist country are not worth the paper they are signed on.”“A collective insane asylum can continue to live in a fictional world,” Yermak added.Zelenskyy responded to the annexation by announcing Ukraine’s fast-track application to join NATO. In a decree released Tuesday, he also ruled out negotiations with Russia, declaring that Putin’s actions made talking to the Russian leader impossible.In the eastern Kharkiv region, more disturbing images emerged from areas recently reclaimed from Russia.Serhiy Bolvinov, who heads the investigative department of the national police in the region, said authorities are investigating an alleged Russian torture chamber in the village of Pisky-Radkivski.AdvertisementHe posted an image of a box of what appeared to be precious metal teeth and dentures presumably extracted from those held at the site. The authenticity of the photo could not be confirmed.Ukraine’s prosecutor general also spoke of new evidence of torture and killings found Wednesday in the Kharkiv region.Andriy Kostin told The Associated Press on the sidelines of a security conference in Warsaw that he had just been notified of four bodies found with signs of possible torture. He said they were believed to be civilians but an investigation was still needed.Two bodies were found in a factory in Kupiansk with their hands bound behind their backs, while two other bodies were found in Novoplatonivka, their hands linked by handcuffs.During his public speech, Kostin said officials found the bodies of 24 civilians, including 13 children and one pregnant woman, who had been killed in six cars near Kupiansk. It was not clear when the discovery was made.AdvertisementOn the battlefield, Russia and Ukraine gave conflicting assessments of a Ukrainian counter-offensive in the Russian-occupied southern Kherson region. A Moscow-installed regional official insisted that Ukrainian advances had been halted.“As of this morning ... there are no movements” by Kyiv’s forces, Kirill Stremousov said Wednesday in comments to state-run Russian news agency RIA Novosti. He vowed the Ukrainian fighters would not enter the city of Kherson.However, the Ukrainian military said the Ukrainian flag had been raised above seven Kherson region villages previously occupied by the Russians. The closest of the liberated villages to the city of Kherson is Davydiv Brid, some 100 kilometers (60 miles) away.The deputy head of the Ukrainian regional government, Yurii Sobolevskyi, said military hospitals were full of wounded Russian soldiers and that Russian military medics lacked supplies. Once they are stabilized, Russian soldiers were getting sent to Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014.Advertisement“Not everyone arrives,” Sobolevskyi wrote.In the neighboring Mykolaiv region, the governor said Russian troops have started to withdraw from Snihurivka, a city of 12,000 that Moscow seized early in the war and annexed along with the Kherson region. A Russian-installed official in Snihurivka, Yury Barbashov, denied that Russian troops had lost control of the city, a strategic railway hub, but said the Ukrainian forces were advancing.In the Moscow-annexed eastern Donetsk region, where Ukrainian forces still control some areas, Russian forces shelled eight towns and villages, the Ukrainian presidential office said.After reclaiming the Donetsk city of Sviatohirsk, Ukrainian forces located a burial ground for civilians and found the bodies of four people, according to Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko.In the Luhansk region, also in the eastern Donbas, Gov. Serhiy Haidai said Ukrainian forces have retaken several villages. He did not name the villages, but said the retreating Russian forces are mining the roads and buildings.AdvertisementIn central Ukraine, multiple explosions rocked Bila Tserkva, a city about 80 kilometers (50 miles) south of the capital, Kyiv. Regional leader Oleksiy Kuleba said six Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones struck the city and set off fires at what he described as infrastructure facilities. One person was wounded.Russia has increasingly employed kamikaze or suicide drones in recent weeks, posing a new challenge to Ukrainian defenses. The unmanned vehicles can stay aloft for long periods of time before diving into targets and detonating their payloads at the last moment.Many of the earlier attacks with the Iranian-made drones happened in the south of Ukraine and not near the capital, which hasn’t been targeted for weeks.___Hanna Arhirova reported from Kyiv, Ukraine.___Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",Adam Schreck | AP,Putin signs annexation of Ukrainian regions as losses mount
