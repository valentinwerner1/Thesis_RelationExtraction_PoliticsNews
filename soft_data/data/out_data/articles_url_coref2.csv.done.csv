847,But the only economic argument for this kind of agreement would be that we could strike back once European factories are seized in China.,
848,"Otherwise, this kind of agreement's not a very smart idea.",
849,But Russia and Ukraine have failed so far.Professor Roubini: It's not just about payment systems.,
850,China is going around the world selling subsidized 5G technologies that can be used for spying.,
851,Professor Roubini asked the president of an African country why the president of an African country gets 5G technology from China and not from the West.,
852,"the president of an African country told Professor Roubini, an African country are a small country, so someone will spy on an African country anyway.",
853,"Then, Professor Roubini might as well take subsidized 5G technologies that can be used for spying, subsidized 5G technologies that can be used for spying's cheaper.",
854,China have suggested to the Saudis that China price and charge for the oil China sell the Saudis in renminbi.,<triplet> China <subj> Saudis <obj> Engage In Material Cooperation
855,And China have more sophisticated payment systems than anyone else in the world.,
856,Alipay and WeChat pay are used by a billion Chinese every day for billions of transactions.,
857,"In Paris, you can already shop at Louis Vuitton with WeChat pay.DER SPIEGEL: In the 1970s, we also had an energy crisis, high inflation and stagnant growth, so-called stagflation.",
858,Are we experiencing something similar now?Roubini: It is worse today.,
859,"Back then, we didn't have as much public and private debt as we do today.",
860,"If central banks raise interest rates now to fight inflation, it will lead to the bankruptcy of many »zombie« companies, shadow banks and government institutions.",
861,"Besides, the oil crisis was caused by a few geopolitical shocks then, there are more today.",
862,"And just imagine the impact of a Chinese attack on Taiwan, which produces 50 percent of all semiconductors in the world, and 80 percent of the high-end ones.",
863,"a Chinese attack on Taiwan, which produces 50 percent of all semiconductors in the world, and 80 percent of the high-end ones would be a global shock.",
864,We depend more on semiconductors today than on oil.,
865,DER SPIEGEL: Professor Roubini are very critical of central bankers and central bankers's lax monetary policy.,
866,Is there any central bank that gets it right these days?Roubini: central bankers are damned either way.,
867,Either central bankers fight inflation with high policy rates and cause a hard landing for the real economy and the financial markets.,
868,"Or central bankers wimp out and blink, don't raise rates and inflation keeps rising.",
869,"Because when inflation rises, lenders charge higher interest rates.",
870,"One example: If inflation goes from 2 to 6 percent, then U.S. government bond rates will have to go from 4 to 8 percent to keep bringing the same yield; and private borrowing costs for mortgages and business loans will be even higher.",
871,"This makes it much more expensive for many companies, because many companies have to offer much higher interest rates than government bonds, which are considered safe.",
872,"We have so much debt right now that something like this could lead to a total economic, financial and monetary collapse.",
873,"And we're not even talking about hyperinflation like in the Weimar Republic, just single digit inflation.DER SPIEGEL: The overriding risk Professor Roubini describe in Professor Roubini's book is climate change.",
874,"Isn't rising debt secondary in light of the possible consequences of a climate catastrophe?Roubini: We have to worry about everything at the same time, as all these megathreats are interconnected.",
875,"One example: Right now, there is no way to significantly reduce CO2 emissions without shrinking the economy.",
876,"And even though 2020 was the worst recession in 60 years, green house gas emissions only fell by 9 percent.",
877,"But without strong economic growth, we will not be able to solve the debt problem.",
878,"So, we have to find ways to grow without emissions.DER SPIEGEL: Given all these parallel crises: How do Professor Roubini assess the chances of democracy surviving against authoritarian systems like in China or Russia?Roubini: Professor Roubini am worried.",
879,Democracies are fragile when there are big shocks.,
880,There is always some macho man then who says »some macho man then who says »I will save the country« and who blames everything on the foreigners will save the country« and who blames everything on the foreigners.,
881,That's exactly what Putin did with Ukraine.,
882,"We could see violence and a real civil war in The United Kingdom In Germany, things look comparatively good for now.",
883,But what happens if things go wrong economically and people vote more for the right-wing opposition?,
884,"DER SPIEGEL: Mr. Farrar, many people can no longer stand to hear the word COVID, many people suppress the pandemic and pretend the pandemic's over.",
885,"But the pandemic will never be over, COVID will be with us forever.",
886,"In this sense, the phrase ""We will have to learn to live with it"" is true.",
887,Mr. Farrar just don't think we're in the stable phase yet – on the contrary.,
888,DER SPIEGEL: Where do we stand?Farrar: DER SPIEGEL saw what happened here in Germany after the Oktoberfest.,
889,"In the United Kingdom, too, community transmission is rising rapidly – one in 35 people in the United Kingdom is currently infected with COVID.",
890,one in 35 people in England’s a staggering level.,
891,"How are Mr. Farrar doing today, after almost three years of the coronavirus storm?",
892,"For Mr. Farrar personally, on the one hand, it was amazing to deal with COVID intellectually, to think about what the right advice to give or not give is.",
893,"On the other hand, Mr. Farrar didn’t appreciate how much this crisis would take possession of Mr. Farrar's personal life.",
894,Many of Mr. Farrar's colleagues in other countries felt the same way.,
895,"Not only because Many of my colleagues in other countries's families had to deal with COVID like everyone else, but also because Many of my colleagues in other countries were so exposed in public.",
896,You get death threats and things put through the letterbox and social media abuse to you and your family members.,
897,That has been difficult to cope with at times.,
898,"DER SPIEGEL: Mr. Farrar experienced SARS-1 in Vietnam, later bird flu, and then came Ebola.",
899,"Did that make Mr. Farrar better prepared for a coronavirus pandemic?Farrar: SARS-1 lasted nine months and, in the end, 800 people died.",
900,"Ebola in West Africa seemed awful at the time, and Ebola in West Africa was awful.",
901,"But in the end, 11,000 people died in total.",
902,"With COVID, on the other hand, probably somewhere between 15 and 20 million people have died.",
903,"On top of that, COVID leaves a society totally disrupted, not just health, but economies and school and education and our relationships with each other.",
904,People will still be talking about the pandemic in a hundred years' time.,
905,DER SPIEGEL: What scenario do Mr. Farrar expect for autumn and winter?Farrar: Hmmm.,
906,"Farrar: Mr. Farrar've got less good now, though.",
907,"Back then, at the end of January, it was easier: Every red flag was waving about COVID.",
908,"COVID was novel, COVID was a respiratory infection, there was human to human and asymptomatic transmission.",
909,That's an undergraduate 101 of what keeps you awake at night.,
910,You didn't have to have very much information to know that you had to take that seriously and you had to act.,
911,DER SPIEGEL: Should COVID still keep us awake at night?Farrar: Now we're in a much more complex world.,
912,We are actually entering into a new phase of the pandemic.,
913,Two things have changed.,
914,"One is: These viruses are now so transmissible that These viruses are circulating in the community, even in populations like that of the United Kingdom, with very high rates of immunity over 90 percent, from natural infection, from vaccination or both.",
915,"Secondly, we are no longer dealing with one dominant type of virus, but with a whole soup of variants.DER SPIEGEL: What does that tell us?Farrar: That we should just try and reduce transmission where we can, at least over the course of the coming Northern Hemisphere winter.",
916,"Otherwise, we allow COVID to continue to spawn trillions and trillions of copies in millions of people.",
917,Each one has the possibility of becoming immune to our vaccines and our immunity.,
918,"And so, anything we can do to reduce the transmission is a good thing.",
919,Like the mask mandate on public transport here in Germany.,
920,"In the United Kingdom, Mr. Farrar’m one of the very few people now still wearing a mask on public transport.",
921,"DER SPIEGEL: And what does the soup of variants mean?Farrar: Mr. Farrar don't know what the implication of the soup of variants is yet, but Mr. Farrar know the soup of variants’s different.",
922,"And when anything changes in a pattern that has been pretty stable, but it then changes – there must be a reason for that.DER SPIEGEL: Mr. Farrar must have some ideas about what is going on.Mr.",
923,Farrar: COVID is identifying niches that COVID can exploit.,
924,"Meanwhile, COVID's no longer hitting a naive, virgin population with no immunity, but billions of people, each with a slightly different immune system.",
925,"People have been vaccinated with different vaccines at different times, some have been infected in between, each with different variants.",
926,And COVID adapts to this diversity among people.DER SPIEGEL: Is it still possible to find a vaccine for this whole soup of different variants?Farrar: We have to get ourselves out of that situation.,
927,And Mr. Farrar think the only way we're going to get ourselves out of that situation is the generation of vaccines.,
928,"DER SPIEGEL: What situation do Mr. Farrar mean?Farrar: If we don't develop vaccines that block transmission and prevent illness, we will constantly be in this cycle of sort of fear and arguments.",
929,"True, there's never going to be a lockdown again, because society would not accept a lockdown.",
930,But the tensions would remain: Should we allow the Oktoberfest to go ahead or not?,
931,Can we open the schools safely after the autumn holidays?,
932,And it would be completely safe.,
933,DER SPIEGEL: How realistic is it that such a perfect vaccine will materialize?Farrar: Is such a perfect vaccine possible today?,
934,"No, certainly not.",
935,Would such a perfect vaccine be possible this decade?,
936,Possibly not yet either.,
937,But a vaccine that reduces or blocks transmission is what we should be aiming for.,
938,"That brings DER SPIEGEL back to Mr. Farrar's first question about repressing the pandemic: Yes, at this point that would be very dangerous.",
939,Such a third-generation vaccine must ultimately be developed with both public and private money.,
940,"But if the political class moves on and just wants to forget about the pandemic and pretend the pandemic's over, Mr. Farrar fear, that investment won't come.DER SPIEGEL: What happens then?Farrar: Imagine you're sitting here in Berlin in three or five years, the hospitals are filling up again, COVID has evolved into some kind of post-Omicron variant that completely bypasses our immune defenses.",
941,"We would then be at risk of severe courses again, as if we were unvaccinated.",
942,That would be unforgivable.,
943,"It would be awful.DER SPIEGEL: When you look back, what was the most momentous mistake in the pandemic response?Farrar: The biggest mistake was that we didn't take the pandemic seriously enough in the first six weeks of 2020.",
944,the first six weeks of 2020 was the time when a pandemic could still have been prevented.,
945,"From the beginning of January, it was clear what was happening in Wuhan.",
946,"By the end of January, it was clear how dangerous the situation was.",
947,"And even though this information was available, the rest of the world didn’t act until March – two critical months passed in which COVID was spreading.",
948,"Instead, we had a U.S. President Donald Trump, who dismissed what was happening as ""kung flu,"" and in Europe, at least in the United Kingdom, there was a sense that this was all happening in faraway China, and northern Italy was also somehow different – it won't be so bad here.",
949,"It was a kind of complacency, the arrogance of exceptionalism.DER SPIEGEL: But even the World Health Organization didn't take the spread via aerosols seriously and didn’t issue a warning about the spread via aerosols until the autumn of 2020 …Farrar: Yes, DER SPIEGEL are right, that was a very big mistake.",
950,"We could have prepared better if bigger decisions would have been made around aerosols, around face masks, around the best treatment options, personal protective equipment for nurses, doctors, about the capacity for intensive care units.",
951,That would have saved an enormous number of lives.DER SPIEGEL: What was the most difficult moment for Mr. Farrar in the pandemic: Mr. Farrar felt particularly powerless in September 2020 …DER SPIEGEL: What happened then?,
952,"Mr. Farrar: Nothing, that was it.",
953,The number of infections went up again.,
954,"We knew what was going to happen, but the politicians didn't use the summer to prepare the United Kingdom for the winter …DER SPIEGEL: … It was similar in Germany …Mr. Farrar: … And yet we didn't take action until December.",
955,We were sleepwalking into tragedy.,
956,"Then, in December, and January and February 2021, a lot of people died; almost half of all COVID deaths in the United Kingdom up to that point were in that short period of time.DER SPIEGEL: Did that anger Mr. Farrar: Sad is a better word for it.",
957,"After what we had gone through in March, all the deaths, September 2020 was just a very dark moment for Mr. Farrar.",
958,Especially since we knew by then that we were going to have safe and effective vaccines and just had to buy ourselves a little bit of time with contact restrictions.,
959,We should have just pulled ourselves together for a few more months.,
960,"Then almost 90,000 people wouldn't have died in the United Kingdom alone up until the beginning of March SPIEGEL: Mr. Farrar were advising the British government at the time.",
961,"Looking back, what could Mr. Farrar have done better?",
962,"Maybe Mr. Farrar should have tried harder, been clearer.",
963,But it's extremely difficult not to lapse into fear-mongering in crisis communications and still say very clearly what you believe to be the bitter reality.DER SPIEGEL: Could there be another coronavirus pandemic in the foreseeable future?,
964,"Or does humanity now have sufficient immunity to this family of viruses?Farrar: Unfortunately, Mr. Farrar don't know the answer to that question.",
965,Mr. Farrar's guess is that a new coronavirus pandemic is less likely right now than a new coronavirus pandemic was in 2019.,
966,"But there is a wide range of coronaviruses circulating in the animal kingdom, and we have no idea how good the cross-immunity with SARS-CoV-2 really is.",
967,"In any case, coronaviruses should remain high on the list of possible pandemic agents.DER SPIEGEL: So, which pathogen is at the top of Mr. Farrar's list?Farrar: Influenza.",
968,"Just take H5N1, the avian flu virus.",
969,"H5N1, the avian flu virus's extremely deadly, but H5N1, the avian flu virus predominantly affects birds; humans very rarely get infected.",
970,"In 1997, there was the first major outbreak in Hong Kong, later in Vietnam and Indonesia.",
971,"In the meantime, H5N1, the avian flu virus has spread worldwide.",
972,"If, by chance, a pig or a human were to become infected with H5N1, the avian flu virus and a normal influenza virus at the same time, then H5N1, the avian flu virus could recombine – and you would have a new pathogen that could be as contagious as bird flu and as nasty as H5N1, the avian flu virus.",
973,"Actually, it’s incredible that this hasn’t happened yet.DER SPIEGEL: And this could really happen at any time?",
974,"Mr. Farrar: In any case, the next pandemic is likely to come from the animal kingdom.",
975,"And right now, we don't have a systematic approach to understanding and controlling this massive reservoir of viruses circulating in animals.",
976,"In some countries, the political situation prevents that.",
977,"In addition, there is a brilliantly organized business of wildlife trade, on all continents, which is a billion-dollar business – and which massively increases the risk that a virus will jump from the animal kingdom to humans.DER SPIEGEL: What about monkeypox?Farrar: Mr. Farrar don't think the monkeypox virus currently poses the risk of a pandemic the way SARS-CoV-2 does.",
978,"Nevertheless, the monkeypox virus shows how dangerous it is not to keep a close eye on what's going on at the interface between humans and animals.",
979,"Indeed, over the past 15 years, there has been a subtle but documented change in the monkeypox virus in Africa.",
980,"Typically, people infected with the monkeypox virus contracted the monkeypox virus from rodents.",
981,"But over the past 15 years, the transmission chains have become longer and longer …DER SPIEGEL: … the monkeypox virus could be passed from person to person more frequently …Mr. Farrar: ... and that suggests that the monkeypox virus is adapting to humans.",
982,"And then the monkeypox virus has spread from West Africa to Europe and North America, the monkeypox virus has gotten into the community of men having sex with men, and the monkeypox virus's now probably already in every country in the world.DER SPIEGEL: And that can happen with any other animal virus?",

2456,"his party, Forza Italia has declined to just 8 percent.",
2457,What can be learned from that when it comes to dealing with right-wing populists today?Prodi: You have to assemble a coalition if you want to defeat the right.,
2458,You must agree on a small number of fundamentals and then stick together.,

2471,Italy needs the 200 million euros from the EU fund.,
2472,The same held true for the Five Star Movement.,
2473,"It would be suicide for Giorgia Meloni’s to start a fight with Brussels at this moment, in the middle of a war and in an economic crisis.",
2474,Romano Prodi's bigger worry is that Italy could turn away from Germany and France in the not-too-distant future and toward countries like Hungary.DER SPIEGEL: Romano Prodi fear and axis of anti-Europeans?,
2475,Prodi: and axis of anti-Europeans?,
2476,Prodi is certainly a danger.,
2477,Giorgia Meloni’s has a good relationship with Orbán in Hungary and with the governing PiS party in Poland.,
2478,A new form of nationalism could begin spreading in Europe – at a time when European cooperation is more important than ever.,

3484,"Since Alberto Fernández’s are the great protagonist of the Cambiemos leadership approving the candidates and announcing in Alberto Fernández’s's book what the next president should do, isn’t there a risk of the voters believing that if the next president comes from Cambiemos, the voters will be subordinated to Alberto Fernández’s?",
3485,Isn’t there the risk of the voters wanting to elect a real president?,
3486,"If you are the protagonist of the campaign and overshadow the candidate, would that help your candidate or your opponents?",
3487,"The president is the president who, upon being elected, must take responsibility and lead.",
3488,We must get away from that vision of one enlightened person coming along to solve all our problems.,
3489,The next president must be based on a voluminous team of highly responsible people who will take charge of pushing the cultural change.,

3491,"When my successors wanted Former president Mauricio Macri's advice or to debate with Former president Mauricio Macri, my successors came to Former president Mauricio Macri.In Argentina’s we have had many leaders who have been control freaks.",
3492,"Former president Mauricio Macri believe in the complete opposite, in training squads and generating new leaderships.",
3493,It’s difficult for people to get to know the new leaders so you have to give the new leaders space so that the new leaders can shine and not be the protagonist all the time yourself.,
3494,[Political veteran] David Owen has theorised over the syndrome of hubris which afflicts most presidents.,
3495,Some think that in the second half of your term you lost your simple style and the common touch.,
3496,"From the fraternal visits to ordinary people and sharing the ñoquis of the 29th, which was the centre of the Frente de Todos government's campaigns, the Frente de Todos government passed to a more pretentious style, very much the G20 president monopolising the truth and that helped to determine the Frente de Todos government's defeat in 2019.",
3497,What do Former president Mauricio Macri think of that?That’s one opinion.,
3498,Former president Mauricio Macri don’t think so.,
3499,"But as from the 14 tons of stones [against pension reform], the unification of Peronism against the Frente de Todos government, the systematic aggression like the [Santiago] Maldonado case or exploiting the tragedy of the [submarine] i, the Frente de Todos government were very battered, perhaps placed on the defensive and trying to be the first [non-Peronist] government in 92 years to serve out the Frente de Todos government's term, even in a minority, against a very savage version of Peronism.",
3500,Some of the Frente de Todos government's aides advocated shutting down the AFI intelligence services as an uncontrollable source of problems.,
3501,Some of your aides said it was wrong to place an inexperienced personal friend [Gustavo Arribas] at the helm of AFI and this is one of the issues on which the Frente de Todos government's government has been most criticised.,
3502,Was that decision correct?There has never been any real leadership over AFI [previously SIDE] since 1983.,
3503,It’s an insoluble issue and many governments have come and gone since then.,
3504,"the Frente de Todos government had some successes, resolved some problems.",
3505,On the external front the Frente de Todos government earned Argentina’s a degree of respect which Argentina’s has never had before.,
3506,the Frente de Todos government achieved integration between the Frente de Todos government's intelligence agents and all the anti-terrorist networks worldwide.,
3507,All the G20 reports praised the Frente de Todos government's work.,
3508,"When the Frente de Todos government sought to change the pension system, there was agitation and an enormous demonstration hurling tons of stones at Congress.",
3509,"After the Frente de Todos government won the biggest [midterm] victory [for a non-Peronist government] since [Raúl] Alfonsín in 1985, they virtually staged a coup d’état.",
3510,"That’s how bellicose Kirchnerism was against the Frente de Todos government's government.Besides, the average Argentine did not feel the need for profound change.",
3511,Others say that the Frente de Todos government should have done more even at the cost of not completing the Frente de Todos government's term.,
3512,Those are opinions.,
3513,"But at the end of the day, Argentina’s is on the point of leaving behind decades of populism because, for almost the first time, a non-populist government could finish a non-populist government's term.",
3514,But Former president Mauricio Macri believe that it will have a fundamental value starting from next year.,
3515,Will Argentina’s be the only country to vote for a programme inspired by Max Weber’s Protestant ethic?,
3516,I’m optimistic.,
3517,"Argentina’s’re the only country which has passed from being one of the five richest countries in the world to being among the poorest, but today we are absolutely clear as to which ideas have been destructive for us.It’s an error placing the focus on persons, the failure comes from the ideas pushed by Kirchnerism.",
3518,Anybody applying the ideas pushed by Kirchnerism would have caused the same failure for Argentina’s as the ideas pushed by Kirchnerism did.,
3519,There is much to be learned there.,
3520,"We cannot continue allowing ourselves to be cheated in order to sustain ideologies presented in sentimental terms, as is the case with [state airline] Aerolíneas Argentinas.",
3521,The planes must be private and the state must regulate this sector so that there is competition.,
3522,"That is what we are understanding and it is going to open up enormous possibilities for us looking ahead.If that means beginning to emerge from the catastrophe into which they have led us, saturating Argentine society with privileges and Mafia styles of behaviour, it must be done because if not, there is no future.",
3523,"If nobody invests in Argentina’s, there are no jobs, credit or savings, just inflation.",
3524,We need our kids not to leave Argentina’s but to give ourselves another opportunity to change Argentina’s.,

3529,Former president Mauricio Macri feel at peace.,
3530,"If you have nobody to share with, how diffícult it is to be happy.",
3531,Why do Former president Mauricio Macri refer so much to Boca Juniors for metaphors and political comparisons?,
3532,When did Former president Mauricio Macri turn into a leader?,
3533,Do Former president Mauricio Macri think that leadership on the pitch can be compared with business or political leadership?,
3534,What are the similarities?The experience of managing Boca was an apprenticeship for politics.,
3535,Former president Mauricio Macri found very few things there that Former president Mauricio Macri had not seen previously in Boca.,
3536,Argentine football is very intertwined with politics.,
3537,What you end up learning is that a good leader is capable of having a dream and getting many people to make a dream many people's own.,
3538,A good leader has to know how to assemble a team in order to turn things into reality.,
3539,A good leader must be resilient and not fold in the face of the first change of fortune and A good leader must be fair.,
3540,"A good leader will really know why A good leader’s there and will know when to say “No” and not take the easy way of saying “Yes” because the easy way of saying “Yes” suits A good leader, even if the easy way of saying “Yes” is not the right thing.",
3541,"his second book in three years, Para Qué harps permanently on making dreams come true and on juggling between passion and reason.",
3542,Former president Mauricio Macri even dedicate a whole chapter to “saying no.”,
3543,How much denial and how much reason is necessary for leadership?,
3544,And how do you combine reason and denial in making dreams come true?There are many leaders who have achieved incredible things through denial because many leaders who have achieved incredible things through denial because they turned reality on its head and were lucky turned reality on reality's head and were lucky.,
3545,But Former president Mauricio Macri don’t believe in that model.,
3546,Former president Mauricio Macri believe that one must be permanently aware of reality and succeed by doing things well.,
3547,"When there is no contact with reality, success is temporary and then everything goes to hell.",
3548,"his second book in three years, Para Qué has two leitmotivs: leadership and power.",
3549,"Even if you begin the second half by saying that two leitmotivs: leadership and power go hand-in-hand, you place leadership more in your stage as businessman and president of Boca, mentioning power for the first time when Former president Mauricio Macri speak of your start in politics.",
3550,"Is power uniquely political?Power is everywhere, even in the relationship of couples.",
3551,"power is something which accompanies us, innate to human beings, we have to learn to deal with power.",
3552,"The secret is: when you have power, don’t abuse power.",
3553,"If you want to test the character of a man, give a man power.",
3554,That is where you see the true nature of a human being.,
3555,"That is why you have to know yourself because if not, you can do some very bad things if you do not learn how to handle the situation to give benefit to lives when having a quota of power.Those proposing to lead at different levels should know that humanity faces a level of complexity as never before and should understand that Those proposing to lead at different levels are going to govern in an ultra-complex situation.",
3556,It would be an absolute error to underestimate or minimise that context.,
3557,That is something Former president Mauricio Macri put to people every day.,
3558,"There is no such thing as magic or a saviour, etc.",
3559,There is a complex world full of complex situations which will have to be managed on a day-to-day basis.,
3560,Former president Mauricio Macri also dedicate a complete chapter to [the 2004 nightclub fire tragedy] Cromañón.,
3561,How much influence did the 2004 nightclub fire tragedy] Cromañón have in Cromañón's political life?,
3562,the 2004 nightclub fire tragedy] Cromañón certainly did in Former president Mauricio Macri because from that moment we began to discuss whether we should be making a contribution to politics or not.,
3563,The whole system wanted the situation covered up and made us feel like outsiders.,
3564,"The whole system told us: “It would not suit Former president Mauricio Macri [Former president Mauricio Macri] because if [Juan Domingo] Perón, does not carry on, [[Juan Domingo] Perón's deputy mayor Jorge] Telerman would be a very tough candidate.”",
3565,Again the dilemma was what suits you versus the correct.There were leaders who showed honesty and balance in the face of grief-stricken parents.,
3566,Nothing compares to your kid going to a nightclub and never coming back.,
3567,"That breaks your heart, it was real anguish.",
3568,Former president Mauricio Macri was new to politics.,
3569,There was a flood of people wanting into the lists of Compromiso para el Cambio [as Juntos por el Cambio was then called] because the lists and candidates were piling up very abruptly.,
3570,It was an extreme situation and having defended the truth ended up generating a party which would be a protagonist in Argentina’s nationwide for many years to come.,
3571,"With ([ormer vice-president] Gabriela Michetti at the head, there were leaders who really put leaders who really put their backs into it against a system which treated us as idiots, telling us that we did not understand anything's backs into it against a system which treated us as idiots, telling us that we did not understand anything.",
3572,Former president Mauricio Macri also dedicate a chapter to communication.,
3573,"Is communication one of the changes which PRO brought into politics?Without doubt, the Frente de Todos government innovated in communication.",
3574,Former president Mauricio Macri think that has a lot to do with Former president Mauricio Macri's personality.,
3575,Former president Mauricio Macri’m one of those people who believes in sincericide.,
3576,"The shortest route to happiness, the perfect union between two points is telling the truth.",
3577,Former president Mauricio Macri never believed in grey areas.,
3578,Black and white have huge value because they construct what moves a society.,
3579,The most important thing for a society is confidence.,
3580,"When you come out of the grey areas and give people certainty, everybody knows how to manage.",
3581,"When everything is a matter of opinion, it’s a disaster.Communication has been pivotal for us, always close to the people, ringing door-bells, which was started after a flood and which Former president Mauricio Macri never stopped doing.",
3582,Communication’s all about understanding for whom you are doing things and how they see it.,
3583,Communication today is more complex than ever because the level of information which we receive every day is a challenge which can never be met.,
3584,"Despite having done some very good things, one established criticism of the Frente de Todos government was a lack of communication.",
3585,Something is always lacking.,
3586,the Frente de Todos government did innovate and everybody recognises that but at the same time many people feel that it was not enough.,
3587,There is always room to communicate still more.,
3588,Such was the perversity that myriad sideshows pressing petty sectorial and political points managed to steal centre stage from the original draft budget itself projecting an absurdly undershooting inflation of 60 percent – that budget in general and that inflation projection in particular (giving Argentina free rein over all the revenues above 60 percent) should always have been the central issue.Myriad sideshows stealing centre stage but one in particular.,
3589,"Facing the original draft budget itself projecting an absurdly undershooting inflation of 60 percent, the opposition incredibly allowed the opposition to be distracted by the red herring of judicial branch taxation.",
3590,"A tremendous media buzz arose whereby taxing judges was malicious Kirchnerite payback for the corruption trials against the vice-president and the vice-president's acolytes, an interpretation premised on the obsessive notion that all Argentina problems revolve around the vice-president.",
3591,"Yet judicial branch taxation began with a bill (albeit not retroactive) introduced by the Mauricio Macri presidency in late 2016 and passed by Congress in early 2017 – nothing very Kirchnerite about a bill (albeit not retroactive) introduced by the Mauricio Macri presidency in late 2016 and passed by Congress in early 2017 and nothing unreasonable either, given that the monthly salaries of some judges reach seven digits.This red herring (in any event doomed to failure with even the left voting against in defence of humbler court employees amid humbler court employees's general rejection of an “austerity budget”) covered a multitude of sins, many of them pushed by trade unions – it remains to be seen whether provincial lobbying along similar lines arises in Senate.",
3592,"Perhaps the most egregious was Article 104 which stipulated that the income tax floor of 350,000 pesos for everybody else should be 440,000 pesos for teamsters – a case of the Moyanos blatantly throwing the Moyanos's weight around in a week in which the Moyanos were blackmailing the Moyanos's way to a three-digit pay increase by threatening to bring Argentina to a halt.",<triplet> Moyanos <subj> Moyanos <obj> Coerce
3593,Another case in point was a 250-peso surcharge on airline tickets earmarked for the payment of the airport police.Other additions which should have been more controversial than Other additions which should have been more controversial than they were were included upping the excise on electronics from 17 to 19 percent while halving the excise on electronics or even removing the excise on electronics for the Tierra del Fuego industry (which assembles imported inputs) and increasing the contributions of the self-employed to the union-run healthcare funds.,
3594,"Whitewashing the repatriation of money for investment in construction has obvious points in favour, given Argentina's acute housing shortage, but remains controversial.",
3595,"Dozens of petty items which in isolation only account for the tiniest of percentages of the economy (and that includes the blanket taxation of judges) but together contribute towards a public spending of 29 trillion pesos, all approved in the small hours of Wednesday when most of the citizens paying for it were sleeping.Read more...Stating the less than obvious Polarisation is quite rightly deplored as the cardinal sin of Argentine politics but, quite apart from the strong challenges to the two main coalitions being mounted by the libertarian right and the far left, the budget vote exposed alarming fragmentation among the two main coalitions being mounted by the libertarian right and the far left.",
3596,"Máximo Kirchner, who chaired the Frente de Todos caucus at the start of this year, shunned the entire debate, only showing up to vote at the last minute.",
3597,The three main parties of the Juntos por el Cambio opposition coalition each adopted a different stance – the Radicals voted in favour and the Civic Coalition against while PRO abstained.,
3598,These are only the most important examples of a fragmentation where (as with this budget saga as a whole) the sideshows sometimes spoke louder than the centre stage.And at the end of the day much ado about nothing.,
3599,"Over the years the budgets have ritually presented the budgets's estimates of growth, inflation, exchange rates, etc., only to become dead letters in the following year although the mistakes (especially undershooting inflation in order to place the extra revenues beyond the reach of Congress as potential slush funds) can have consequences.",
3600,And this budget is more vulnerable to becoming grandly irrelevant than most because 2023 happens to be an electoral year.,
3601,The idea was that both local and foreign investors would feel encouraged by Mauricio Macri's optimistic assessment of the task awaiting Mauricio Macri.,
3602,"Of course, the appalling state of the country’s's economy is not entirely due to Macri’s government's incompetence – the Covid pandemic followed by a worldwide inflationary surge and the sharp rise in energy prices caused by Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine certainly did not help – but the current consensus is that, by insisting on printing huge amounts of money and doling huge amounts of money out to Macri’s government's political clientele, Alberto Fernández and the departing president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner made things far worse.",
3603,"As a result, a far more market-friendly approach than Macri’s government to the country’s's many problems has swung into fashion.",
3604,"The “libertarian” Javier Milei and, less spectacularly, the like-minded José Luis Espert, are making inroads into the support enjoyed not just by the opposition alliance “Together for Change” but also, in the huge Buenos Aires Province slum belt, by the Kirchnerite wing of the Peronist movement which depends on the votes of the country’s poorest and least-educated inhabitants.",
3605,"Read more...A fireworks summit Alarmed by what is happening, Peronists of all stripes are retreating to the fiefs Peronists of all stripes have long dominated where Peronists of all stripes think Peronists of all stripes will be able to ride out the onrushing storm which, some fear, could have catastrophic electoral consequences for many of Peronists of all stripes unless Peronists of all stripes distance Peronists of all stripes from the increasingly chaotic national government.",
3606,"Opposition leaders may be less alarmed than Peronists of all stripes, but Opposition leaders too are nervously watching the opinion polls.",
3607,"For them, it is not merely a question of political posturing but rather of deciding just how much economic liberalism the country’s would need for the country’s to get back on the country’s's feet.",
3608,"They assume that the worse things get, the more the country’s will have to swallow.Have they been beguiled by an ideology which makes many difficult problems look wonderfully simple, or is it that what really irks them is the way large numbers of people, especially politicians and their hangers-on, have contrived to live off the public sector without giving anything of value in return?",
3609,This presumably matters more to them than any philosophical question.,
3610,"As far as The “libertarian” Javier Milei is concerned, caste members are noxious parasites who feed off the rest of the population.",
3611,"This may be a bit unfair because there are surely many politicians who dedicate themselves full-time to the common good and public employees who do more than enough to earn their keep, but it is undeniable that there are also plenty of time-servers and organisations, such as La Cámpora, which operate like mutual-aid associations and specialise in finding cushy jobs for their members in exchange for some political activism.",
3612,"Needless to say, much the same happens in the best-run countries, though not to the same degree as here, where far too many mediocrities get involved in politics only because far too many mediocrities think, quite realistically, that politics will guarantee far too many mediocrities a decent income.",
3613,"Read more...The search for something different All these people are dead against serious change because All these people know full well that, were it not for the constantly expanding public sector, All these people would be left to fend for All these people in an unforgiving world.",
3614,"For such individuals, something far more important than ideological differences – liberalism versus Peronism, capitalism versus socialism, stuff like that – is at stake.",
3615,"If, as could well happen, the current order does comes crashing down after being hit by an economic thunderbolt, many who have managed to live off the current order will fall into the swelling ranks of the newly impoverished, a fate they will surely deserve but which they will not blame on their own collective behaviour but on the wickedness of whoever is obliged to clear up the mess they will have left behind.In this newstopics:As I See ItNeilsonBuenos Aires HeraldBuenos Aires TimesCrisisGovernmentElectionPeronismFrente De Todos </Text></Article><Article url=""https://www.batimes.com.ar/news/opinion-and-analysis/ah-but-macri.phtml"" paper=""bat""><Text>Since the week started with the presentation of ex-president Mauricio Macri’s second book Para Qué (a title to which ex-president Mauricio Macri’s's enemies might be tempted to add question-marks), this column aims at supplementing ex-president Mauricio Macri’s's manifesto with an unofficial and incomplete biography based on personal perceptions going back almost exactly three decades.It was the spring of 1992 when I first ran across ex-president Mauricio Macri’s at a British Embassy reception in the prelude to the privatisation of Aguas Argentinas by the Carlos Menem presidency where Thames Water (in partnership with Socma, the holding of the Macri family) was a frontrunner.",
3616,"Nevertheless, some months later the waterworks went to the French Suez/Lyonnaise des Eaux, who undercut the Thames Water (in partnership with Socma, the holding of the Macri family) bid by just a couple of cents so clearly the French Suez/Lyonnaise des Eaux, who undercut the Thames Water bid by just a couple of cents were in the know.",
3617,"Which did not surprise me in the least because at that reception ex-president Mauricio Macri’s was telling every man and every man's dog what the Thames Water (in partnership with Socma, the holding of the Macri family) bid was – even I knew.",
3618,Anyway that is all water long under the bridge with Aguas Argentinas's water now in the safe (?),
3619,hands of Economy Minister Sergio Massa’s better (?),
3620,"half, Malena Galmarini.",
3621,"Obviously my interaction with ex-president Mauricio Macri’s started off on the wrong foot but, far more importantly, I would argue that ex-president Mauricio Macri’s started off on the wrong foot.",
3622,"Looking at tycoons worldwide over time, tycoons worldwide's flair for business is so rarely passed onto often spoiled offspring and descendants – perhaps since Indian wealth is suddenly in vogue with Britain’s new prime minister Rishi Sunak, Ratan Tata might be cited as an exception to that rule, showing Ratan Tata to be as brilliant a businessman as Ratan Tata's great-grandfather the Tata Group founder Jamsetji Tata (1839-1904).",
3623,"this column does not understand why Juntos por el Cambio is so evasively defensive about the illegal espionage during ex-president Mauricio Macri’s's presidency – spies always spy because that is the nature of the beast, before, during and since ex-president Mauricio Macri’s, so why not simply say so?",
3624,Thereafter ex-president Mauricio Macri’s rose way beyond my level and I was never physically close to ex-president Mauricio Macri’s either as City Mayor or President.,
3625,Polarisation conspires against any balanced assessment of ex-president Mauricio Macri’s.,
3626,ex-president Mauricio Macri’s's presidency clearly came to a bad end in 2019 but how much of that was anticipation of the current administration in the 17 weeks between the PASO primaries and the change of government?,
3627,In the month before PASO (July) an industrial growth of 4.8 percent more than doubled the inflation of 2.2 percent.,
3628,"We will leave ex-president Mauricio Macri’s for now pondering, Hamlet-like, whether to run or not to run while perhaps bemoaning like Hamlet: “The time is out of joint; O cursed spite!",
3629,/That ever I was born to set it right.”,
3630,"In Argentina, most major political leaders agree in public that, without some sort of basic consensus, Argentina's socio-economic project is untenable.",
3631,"Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, current vice-president and one of the most powerful people in Argentina, had asked for something like the “Moncloa Pacts,” which were a cornerstone of Spain’s transition from the fascism of Francisco Franco to the moderate and successful social democracy that Spain’s is today.",
3632,"We are living in the era of the “grieta” squared – that is, a double polarisation that antagonistically pits both major coalitions against each other, while internally seeing both major coalitions become deeply divided into hawks and doves.",
3633,"Sergio Massa, a key actor in the ruling Frente de Todos coalition who is always playing to his own benefit's budget, which includes fairytales like a projection of inflation at 60 percent in 2023, exposed the tectonic plates of the Argentine political system.",
3634,"Máximo Kirchner, the former head of the Frente de Todos caucus in the lower house and an outspoken critic of President Alberto Fernández, was absent throughout the whole debate, only making an appearance to cast a vote.",
3635,"A year before, Máximo Kirchner, the former head of the Frente de Todos caucus in the lower house and an outspoken critic of President Fernández had been picked out as the one to blame for the failure to secure the passage of a budget concocted by Martín Guzmán, while this week Máximo Kirchner, the former head of the Frente de Todos caucus in the lower house and an outspoken critic of President Fernández’s been busy saying Alberto shouldn’t even be a contender for re-election in 2023.",
3636,It didn’t matter that during Mauricio Macri's presidency the PRO party passed laws aimed at eliminating tax benefits for judges and other members of the Judiciary.,
3637,"This time around, and because the 2023 Budget came from a Peronist government, the 2023 Budget was extortion.",
3638,"That’s not the opinion that the PRO party's fellow coalition members, the Radical Civic Union (UCR) espoused, voting in favour of Sergio Massa, a key actor in the ruling Frente de Todos coalition who is always playing to his own benefit's budget.",
3639,"There was even division within the UCR which was forced to vote via videoconference and required a tie-breaker from none other than Julio Cobos, the man who served as a former vice-president during Fernández de Kirchner's presidency and cast a devastating vote against his own boss during a confrontation with the agricultural sector in 2008.",
3640,"Read more...A fireworks summit Examples of this behaviour abound both in Argentina and throughout the region, and probably the world.",
3641,"The underlying question here is whether we, the people, can continue to tolerate this system.",
3642,"The evidence seems to suggest otherwise, as polarisation has increased along with discontent.",
3643,"In a recent masterclass for students of Perfil Educación and our digital subscribers, political strategist and communications expert Antoni Gutiérrez-Rubi explained how Latin America is experiencing a deep crisis that is being exacerbated by a dangerous feedback loop.",
3644,"a deep crisis that is being exacerbated by a dangerous feedback loop is caused by the “Six Ds” (in Spanish): distrust, disillusion, inequality, “demo-crisis,” division, and disinformation.",
3645,"Noting that this generation is one of the first to be certain that this generation will be worse-off than this generation's parents in a long time, political strategist and communications expert Antoni Gutiérrez-Rubi explained that a continuation of a status quo defined by the “Six Ds” (in Spanish): distrust, disillusion, inequality, “demo-crisis,” division, and disinformation will lead to a collapse of the socio-political system and that the only way out is for political leaders to reach agreements that represent a major portion of society.",
3646,This would be the only way to avoid almost immediate rejection as we have seen in Chile with Gabriel Boric and in the United Kingdom with Liz Truss.,
3647,"Our tolerance with the political class is non-existent, and this is very dangerous because it feeds a growing generation of youngsters who have given up on the socio-political system.The disconnect may have to do with the difference between winning elections and governing.",
3648,"It’s the same thing that Buenos Aires City Mayor Horacio Rodríguez Larreta, who currently leads the polls and expects to arrive at next year’s elections as a competitive candidate has been saying for a while: build a supermajority of some 70 percent of votes but also the political will needed to govern.",
3649,"Yet in practice, Buenos Aires City Mayor Horacio Rodríguez Larreta, who currently leads the polls and expects to arrive at next year’s elections as a competitive candidate is increasingly berating Buenos Aires City Mayor Horacio Rodríguez Larreta, who currently leads the polls and expects to arrive at next year’s elections as a competitive candidate's opponents in order to not lose out to Patricia Bullrich, while CFK’s sector continues to work against Alberto and Sergio Massa, a key actor in the ruling Frente de Todos coalition who is always playing to his own benefit in CFK’s sector's apparent self-interest.It is difficult to imagine how our political class can find our political class's way out of this mess, particularly if one analyses all of the cloak-and-dagger negotiations held in the middle of the night in order to pass a fictitious budget that allocates taxpayer money according to political proximity.",<triplet> Horacio Rodríguez Larreta <subj> Horacio Rodríguez Larreta <obj> Disapprove
3650,"Society has already grown bored and tired, and promises to move further in that direction as long as the socio-political system fails to solve the socio-political system's basic necessities, in particular the worsening of an individual's welfare.",
3651,"For that, everyone would have to give in a little, starting with Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, current vice-president and one of the most powerful people in the country and Mauricio Macri, to demonstrate that they understand the severity of the situation.",

3656,So too are government leaders gearing up for general elections next year.,

4071,And this columnist's personal contribution to that news story was greater than virtually any other for entirely circumstantial reasons.,

4073,The first is simply that this columnist have not yet gotten around to seeing this highly successful film Argentina.,
4074,It seems to this columnist from this highly successful film Argentina's momentous subject that this highly successful film Argentina would be almost impossible to criticise even if this highly successful film Argentina were a bad film and all the indications are that this highly successful film Argentina is very good (despite the opposition deputy Fernando Iglesias deploring the missed opportunity to bash Peronism).,

4077,The conviction of the military juntas came right at the end of that year (just a fortnight before Christmas) and it is worth asking how much The conviction of the military juntas depended on the previous developments in that year.,
4078,"The economic success of the Austral Plan (bringing inflation down from a monthly 30 percent in June to two percent four months later, just in time for the midterms) paved the way for political success in the midterms (with Raúl Alfonsín’s Radicals garnering the most votes in 20 of the country’s 24 districts) which in turn laid solid foundations for the judicial and moral triumph of the junta trial sentences.But let us not throw out the baby with the bathwater because the junta trial chronicled by that film in turn fed the political and economic success.",

4082,The other day zapping on television (not a that year custom) this columnist came across an Argentine film with a group of friends eating out with starters of melon and cured ham while drinking a bottle of Bianchi burgundy in green glasses and this columnist said to this columnist: “an Argentine film with a group of friends eating out with starters of melon and cured ham while drinking a bottle of Bianchi burgundy in green glasses must be 1984 or that year” and sure enough an Argentine film with a group of friends eating out with starters of melon and cured ham while drinking a bottle of Bianchi burgundy in green glasses was.,

4316,"An example of this leading role has been the creation of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (1988), the adoption of the the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (1992), the establishment of the Kyoto Protocol (1997) and, more recently, the signing of the Paris Agreement (2015).",

5779,their government has had the program in place since the 1970s as a way of reducing population growth.And the program has been successful.,
5780,Female sterilization is the most frequently used contraception method in India and the national birth rate has dropped significantly.,
5781,"In a 2019 survey, almost 30 percent of Indian women of childbearing age reported that almost 30 percent of Indian women of childbearing age had been sterilized.",
5782,"An additional 17 percent said An additional 17 percent used other contraception methods, 45 percent said 45 percent don’t use contraception or have no need for contraception, and 8 percent said 8 percent would like to use contraception but have no access.",
5783,India is no exception.,
5784,"Across the globe, more women protect against pregnancy with sterilization than with condoms or the pill, making sterilization one of the most frequently used contraception methods in the globe – in part because sterilization is widespread in populous countries like India and China.",
5785,"One reason for the popularity of sterilization is that in many countries, other methods of contraception are either unavailable or too expensive.",
5786,And because men rarely go through the process of sterilization men.,
5787,"Some experts, though, are critical of the trend, in part because women often don’t have much of a choice in the matter and Female sterilization is subsidized in places like India for political reasons.",

5790,"Mona, a researcher who works on a sustainable development program for the Observer Research Foundation in Delhi, though, says that such numbers often lead to an inadequate understanding among politicians of what sterilization means for women.Female sterilization, generally can't be reversed.",

5794,"In addition to the compensation provided to women, India also finances most of the clinics where the procedures are performed.",
5795,"In rural areas in particular, says Mona, a researcher who works on a sustainable development program for the Observer Research Foundation in Delhi, such clinics often take the form of mass sterilization centers, and there have been repeated reports over the years of almost factory-like conditions, with some women not surviving the operation due to the poor medical attention some women receive.",
5796,"In 2016, the Supreme Court of India even a ruling that came in response to the deaths of more than 300 sterilization patients in the preceding three years India to close down such sterilization centers, a ruling that came in response to the deaths of more than 300 sterilization patients in the preceding three years.",
5797,"According to reports in the Indian media, however, such clinics continue to operate.Still today, female sterilization is the most efficient method of birth control for their government.",
5798,"On top of that, as Mona, a researcher who works on a sustainable development program for the Observer Research Foundation in Delhi says: ""Family planning in India is up to the woman.""",
5799,"Mona, a researcher who works on a sustainable development program for the Observer Research Foundation in Delhi says that campaigns for methods of contraception are almost always aimed at women, and even though financial compensation for vasectomies tends to be higher than financial compensation for vasectomies is for female sterilizations, hardly any men undergo Female sterilization.",
5800,There are historical reasons for this.,
5801,"During the period between 1975 and 1977 when a state of emergency was declared in India, millions of men were forcibly sterilized in an extremely brief period of time.",
5802,"Since then, vasectomies have become a political taboo in India.",
5803,"""There is hardly any discussion of male sterilization,"" says Mona, a researcher who works on a sustainable development program for the Observer Research Foundation in Delhi.",
5804,"""Part of hardly any discussion of male sterilization is because of history, but there is also a societal stigma which holds that male sterilization harms manhood and virility.""",
5805,But India is by no means the only place where vasectomies are stigmatized and contraception is almost entirely the responsibility of women.,
5806,"""The popularity of female sterilization is an indicator for poverty and for limited access to adequate healthcare,"" says Laura Briggs, professor for international healthcare and reproduction policy at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.",
5807,"""Sterilization is often only the best contraception method when circumstances make Sterilization so.""",
5808,"That is also true for the United States, Laura Briggs, professor for international healthcare and reproduction policy at the University of Massachusetts Amherst says.",
5809,More and more people in the United States are afflicted by poverty and poor medical care.,

5811,"Just how influential social and historical factors can be is also apparent in Puerto Rico, a country that for years has had the highest rate of sterilization in the globe.",
5812,"""Women in Puerto Rico, a country that for years has had the highest rate of sterilization in the world are so familiar with Female sterilization that Female sterilization is simply referred to as 'La Operaciòn,'"" says Iris Lopez, a sociology professor at City College in New York who specializes in the Puerto Rican diaspora and sterilization abuse.A major factor in the high rate of sterilization is the colonization of Puerto Rico, a country that for years has had the highest rate of sterilization in the world by the United States Up until the 1970s, a third of the women in Puerto Rico, a country that for years has had the highest rate of sterilization in the world were sterilized as part of a program financed by the United States.",
5813,"From the perspective of the United States, Puerto Rico, a country that for years has had the highest rate of sterilization in the world's developmental problems were a direct consequence of Puerto Rico, a country that for years has had the highest rate of sterilization in the world's high birthrate.",
5814,Many of the women who underwent Female sterilization did not receive sufficient information and thought Female sterilization was reversible.,
5815,Others were forced to submit to sterilization.But it’s not just the consequences of the program that can still be felt today.,
5816,"U.S. pharmaceutical companies in the 1950s also tested high dosages of progesterone in Puerto Rico, a country that for years has had the highest rate of sterilization in the world, the hormone in birth control pills.",
5817,"""Many women became ill and suffered from side effects,"" says Iris Lopez, a sociology professor at City College in New York who specializes in the Puerto Rican diaspora and sterilization abuse, leading to a situation in which the pill and other modern contraceptive methods were long viewed with skepticism.",
5818,"Only since the mid-2000s has the frequency of sterilization in Puerto Rico, a country that for years has had the highest rate of sterilization in the world begun to fall.",
5819,"But high costs, bureaucracy and a lack of infrastructure continue to limit access to other contraceptives.",
5820,"For Iris Lopez, a sociology professor at City College in New York who specializes in the Puerto Rican diaspora and sterilization abuse, though, another question is also important: ""In a colonial context in which sterilization was long promoted as the only method, can we really speak of a free decision?""",
5821,"The Fight against Forced Sterilization""When it comes to female sterilization, consent is often a gray area,"" says Mona, a researcher who works on a sustainable development program for the Observer Research Foundation in Delhi.",

5823,"""Women aren't given the information Women need to make an informed decision,"" Mona, a researcher who works on a sustainable development program for the Observer Research Foundation in Delhi says.In other countries, too, it is often socially disadvantaged women who are most affected.",
5824,"Female sterilization is frequently performed following Caesarian sections, at a time when the women are often exhausted and can hardly object.",
5825,"Sometimes, doctors sever the fallopian tubes simply because an incision has already been made.Whereas forced sterilizations can be ordered by a court of law in the United States, in Canada it is primarily members of the First Nations who report being sterilized against their will, even though Female sterilization violates Canadian law.",

5857,in a message to the Tehran morality police.Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR) group said that students were on Tuesday staging a sit-in protest at Isfahan University while social media footage indicated a similar action was in progress at the engineering faculty of Amir Kabir university in Tehran.Mahsa Amini who had been arrested by the Tehran morality police death was according to family members caused by a blow to the head while in custody.,

8958,‘Looked like a breath mint’ Renewed interest in UAPs was sparked by a series of high-profile sightings by US military personnel.,
8959,Among one of the most discussed is an encounter with a “tic-tac shaped” object.,
8960,"“a “tic-tac shaped” object looked like a little breath mint in larger-scale; white, oblong, no apparent flight-control surfaces, no apparent physical means of propulsion,” said retired US Navy Lieutenant Commander Alex Dietrich, one of a crew who spotted a “tic-tac shaped” object during a military training mission.",
8961,Explanations have not been forthcoming.,
8962,"In ODNI 2021 report, analysts were able to explain just one out of 144 reported UAP sightings, which was found to be a large, deflated balloon.In the 2022 update, half of a total 366 cases remain unexplained.",
8963,"Those that can be explained are largely thought to be space trash or foreign spyware, mostly from China.",
8964,"Congress has been quick to deny that Congress's UAP investigations have anything to do with a hunt for evidence of extra-terrestrial life, instead focusing in the potential risk of unknown technologies from other countries entering American airspace.",
8965,But the lack of official answers leaves fertile ground for long-established conspiracy theories to thrive.,
8966,"In recent years, amateur sightings of UAPs have also increased.",
8967,"Data from the National UFO Reporting Centre Database, an NGO based in Washington, shows sightings reached an all-time high in the US in April 2020.",
8968,It is no coincidence that amateur sightings peaked during the first Covid lockdowns in the US.,
8969,"“The popularity of conspiracy theories goes up and down depending on societal unrest and societal debates,” says Sander van der Linden, psychology professor at Cambridge University and author of “FOOLPROOF: Why We Fall for Misinformation”.",
8970,‘Keep an open mind’ Yet doubts over government transparency when it comes to UAPs is not entirely misplaced.,
8971,"UFO conspiracy theories were encouraged by the Cold War government keen to maintain an air of mystery around US spyware being tested near Roswell, New Mexico.",
8972,"With promises of declassification of information, new investigations seem to be aiming for greater transparency.",
8973,new investigations may also address more straightforward reasons for seemingly unexplainable sightings: poor quality data in the form of blurry photos and low-resolution videos.,
8974,“Currently the evidence is very poorly presented and doesn't have any technical specifications associated with the evidence.,
8975,"What we actually need is real scientific data and analysis,” says Michael A. Garrett, Sir Bernard Lovell chair in astrophysics at the University of Manchester and director of Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics.",
8976,"With high-quality cameras capturing intentional images, there is the potential for all sorts of new findings.",
8977,"“That could be meteorites entering the Earth's atmosphere, satellites deorbiting… who knows, there might be natural phenomena that are to be discovered,” Michael A. Garrett, Sir Bernard Lovell chair in astrophysics at the University of Manchester and director of Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics adds.",
8978,“It’s important to keep an open mind.”,
8979,"In this spirit, finding proof of alien existence might not be high on the agenda but NASA, at least, has not ruled out the possibility.",

10143,Joe Biden’s was inaugurated two weeks later – but Donald Trump's mendacious claims of having won the 2020 presidential elections still create a sore at the heart of the American body politic.The US is still as divided as ever ahead of the midterms on November 8.,
10144,There are some exceptions – but by and large Republican candidates have lined up behind The US's Trumpist faction.,

10146,"Republican candidates have shared more links to unreliable news sources this year than Republican candidates did in 2020, according to New York University’s Center for Social Media and Politics.As the possibility of Donald Trump running again in 2024 hangs over The US, Donald Trump's false claim that the 2020 vote was stolen has become entrenched.",
10147,Some 70 percent of Donald Trump's Republican supporters believe his false claim that the 2020 vote was stolen.,
10148,"And it is commonplace for Republican midterm candidates to propagate his false claim that the 2020 vote was stolen.A bad sell for swing voters?Most Republican candidates for Congress or key state offices are challenging or questioning the legitimacy of the 2020 results, according to a count by The Washington Post.",
10149,"a count by The Washington Post stands at 291 out of 569 candidates, so 51 percent.",
10150,A similar survey by The New York Times found 51 percent was even greater.This may well backfire for Republican candidates chasing swing voters in swing states.,
10151,"Pennsylvania gubernatorial candidate Doug Mastriano, for example, chartered buses of Donald Trump supporters to the Capitol on January 6, 2021.",
10152,"Pennsylvania gubernatorial candidate Doug Mastriano does not recognise Joe Biden’s victory and has even suggested that, if elected governor, Pennsylvania gubernatorial candidate Doug Mastriano might not certify a Democratic win in 2024.",

10158,"The same is true for Ron Johnson, Republican Senate candidate for Wisconsin – which looked comfortably part of the Democratic “Blue Wall” in 2016, so much so that Hillary Clinton did not visit it during Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign.",

10162,"Polling staff fear intimidation.In the medium term, a substantial presence of election deniers in Congress starting next January suggests two tumultuous years in Washington.",
10163,"If The US win control of the House of Representatives, as expected, with a strong Trumpist presence, one may well expect a dyed-in-the-wool Donald Trump supporter as speaker – an even more extreme GOP leader than current Republican Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who fell into line behind Donald Trump.Chaos in 2024?",
10164,Chaos is on the cards once again in 2024.,
10165,What will state authorities elected in 2022 do if the race is tight?,
10166,The secretaries of state will have control over the conduct of the presidential elections and any recounts.Governors will be able to certify – or not – the verdict at the ballot box.,
10167,"In Georgia, Arizona and Michigan – three states where the race was very tight in 2020 – the proportion of election deniers is especially large.The democratic foundations of The US are at stake if the losers of the elections refused to accept the 2020 results.",

10169,“Republican officials declared the 2020 results and the courts backed Republican officials up.,
10170,"But if election deniers become secretaries of state in charge of elections, and exercise election deniers's power in a partisan way, then we’re going to end up with contested results.",
10171,"All it takes is for one or two swing states to do that, and then no one will agree on the outcome of the election.",

11166,"Foreign powers have hailed the truce signed by the Ethiopian government and Tigrayan leaders to end the brutal war in the north of the country and open up the flow of aid to those at risk of famine, but questions remain over whether The deal will succeed.",
11167,"A day after the applause died away at the signing ceremony in South Africa's capital, Pretoria, the sound of artillery is still booming over the mountains of Tigray.",
11168,There will be a process for the negotiated disarmament of the Tigrayan fighters.,
11169,"Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's ascendancy is marked by the fact that The deal is with the party ruling the region - the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), not - as the Tigrayans had wanted - the ""Government of Tigray"".",
11170,"Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed is rejecting the 2020 elections in Tigray, won by the party ruling the region - the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), and planning for a new poll.",
11171,"However, the Ethiopian government had demanded the complete surrender of the party ruling the region - the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF).",
11172,the Ethiopian government did not achieve the complete surrender of the TPLF.,
11173,The deal emphasises that both parties will abide by the existing federal constitution.,
11174,This includes resolving the status of areas such as the agriculturally rich western Tigray - seized by the neighbouring Amhara region during the early weeks of the brutal war in the north of the country - by constitutional means.,
11175,The deal does not say whether the Tigrayan administration - and the farmers driven out - will return first.,
11176,The humanitarian element of The deal opens the door to ending the starvation and deprivation that have cost the lives of as many as a million people.,
11177,"as many as a million people includes perhaps 10% of Tigray's population of around six million, according to research published by academics in Belgium.",
11178,"After two years of blockade and starvation, and under relentless military pressure from the joint forces of the Ethiopian and Eritrean armies plus forces from the neighbouring Amhara region, Tigrayan leaders made huge concessions.",
11179,Tigrayan leaders's calculation appears to be that the survival of the people of Tigray was at stake.,
11180,"More than a million have been displaced since fighting resumed in August, unable to harvest their crops.",
11181,People are dying of treatable diseases as hospitals run out of basic drugs such as insulin and antibiotics.,
11182,There was no sign of this ending.,
11183,"For the millions who have been deprived of food, medicine and other basic services, essential aid cannot come a day too soon.",
11184,There are many unanswered questions.,
11185,Three are particularly crucial.,
11186,First is Eritrea.,
11187,"According to Western diplomats, the military offensive that broke Tigrayan defence lines was a joint Eritrean-Ethiopian operation directed from Asmara.",
11188,Eritrea is not mentioned by name in The deal.,
11189,"But the text includes a provision for ending ""collusion with any external force hostile to either party"", which could presumably refer to Eritrea.",
11190,Many will be sceptical that the Ethiopian government has the means to implement this.,
11191,Eritrean President Isaias Afewerki is not party to The deal and has the means to pursue the brutal war in the north of the country regardless of any agreement reached by Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed.,
11192,Second is monitoring and verification.,
11193,The deal is a triumph for the Ethiopian government's diplomatic strategy of keeping the international community at bay.,
11194,"The mechanism for monitoring, verification and compliance consists only of a small unit - maximum 10 persons - who report to the African Union (AU) panel chaired by Nigeria's former President Olusegun Obasanjo.",
11195,"In turn, Nigeria's former President Olusegun Obasanjo's mandate is from the AU Commission chairperson Moussa Faki, not the AU Peace and Security Council.",
11196,The UN is excluded entirely.,
11197,Assessing reports of violations and adjudicating disputes will be at the discretion of two men - Nigeria's former President Olusegun Obasanjo and the AU Commission chairperson Moussa Faki - an unusual oversight mechanism to say the least.,
11198,It is standard practice for high-level peace agreements to be witnessed by international partners.,
11199,"The EU was barred from observing, even though The EU is African Union (AU)'s largest donor.",
11200,the Ethiopian government and African Union (AU) will be counting on international endorsement nonetheless - not least because the Ethiopian government desperately needs foreign aid.,
11201,Third is justice and accountability.,
11202,"The deal provides for the Ethiopian government to establish a ""comprehensive national transitional justice policy"", making no mention of any international investigations, for example by the UN Human Rights Council or the African Commission on Human and People's Rights.",
11203,The prospect for peace and an end to the atrocities and starvation in Tigray and the stabilisation of the Ethiopian government depends largely on the good faith of the Ethiopian government.,
11204,"An early test will be the Ethiopian government's promise only to make joint public statements with the party ruling the region - the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) and to put an end to ""hostile propaganda, rhetoric and hate speech"".",
11205,Tigrayans at home and in the diaspora have greeted The deal with dismay.,
11206,It is possible that some Tigrayan commanders would rather continue guerrilla war than submit to what some Tigrayan commanders regard as humiliating peace terms.,
11207,"Others fear that the lesson that Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, Mr Isaias and others will have learned is the opposite - namely that overwhelming force, sustained starvation and an information blackout are effective weapons in pursuit of their objectives.",
11208,"Ethiopians will be hoping that overwhelming force, sustained starvation and an information blackout are not applied to solve other political challenges, including the continuing insurgency in the Oromia region.",
11209,The deal is founded on faith that Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed will lead the Ethiopian government out of the Ethiopian government's crisis.,
11210,That did not happen.,
11211,"Instead Thursday saw fierce fighting, including large-scale attacks by the Ethiopian and Eritrean armies on three fronts, sources in the region say.",
11212,"The credibility of African Union (AU) and the international observers at the talks - the UN, the US and Igad - rests on the AU and the international observers at the talks - the UN, US and Igad's readiness to call out the violators from all sides.",

12182,But now the CCS industry is booming.The French Institute of International Relations counted a record 76 CCS projects on the go in Europe in a 2021 report.,
12183,"Thanks to surging investment in Europe and North America, the CCS industry should be able to sequester 150 million tonnes per year, up from 40 million at present.",
12184,150 million tonnes per year is nevertheless a drop in the ocean when compared to the 38 billion tonnes of CO2 emitted by humans in 2019.,
12185,"Piloted by oil supermajors Total, Shell and Equinor, the Northern Lights project is expected to make Norway a CO2 storage powerhouse.",
12186,"Near the island of Bergen, a terminal is set to capture nearly 1.5 million tonnes of CO2 per year produced by European industry.",
12187,"“The ship will unload The ship's CO2 in liquid form; liquid form’s like water, odourless and colourless,” explained Cristel Lambtone, the Northern Lights project's technical director, speaking to France Info.",
12188,"its CO2 will then be transported through pipelines to be stored 2,500 metres below the North Sea in wells currently being drilled.How does CO2 capture work?Needless to say, CO2 needs to captured before CO2 is buried.",
12189,The easiest way to do this is while fossil fuels or wood are being burned.,
12190,"There are various processes, but the one the CCS industry has mastered best is called “post-combustion” – using a solvent to isolate CO2 from the industrial fumes.",
12191,"the one the CCS sector has mastered best is especially effective on the most polluting manufacturing sites, like power stations, steelworks, chemical plants and cement plants.The next step is to transport CO2 to storage sites such as old oil reservoirs or saline aquifers.",
12192,"“These are not holes but deep formations with porous rocks that allow CO2 to be injected,” Thomas Le Guénan, a geologist at the French Geological and Mining Research Bureau explained.",
12193,“We also look for formations with impermeable rock on top to prevent CO2 from rising up.”,
12194,It is also possible to suck CO2 straight from the atmosphere using giant hoovers.,
12195,The largest operation using this technology is the Orca site in Iceland.,
12196,"Although still in this technology's infancy, this technology has won a lot of investment over the past two years, especially in the US.",
12197,"Tech titans like Elon Musk and Bill Gates have poured in money.A gigafactory capturing CO2 directly from the atmosphere is due to start work in the US state of Wyoming, a big coal producer.",
12198,A gigafactory capturing CO2 directly from the atmosphere aims to capture 5 million tonnes of CO2 per year by 2030.,
12199,"Limits of CO2 captureCCS looks like a godsend as countries around the world struggle to wean countries around the world off fossil fuels.But while prices have reduced significantly, the high costs of these energy-intensive technologies still place a ceiling on what the CCS industry can do.",
12200,"“As things stand, the price of the carbon allowance issued under the EU’s CO2 emissions trading scheme is still lower than the costs for manufacturers of CCS technology,” said Florence Delprat-Jannaud, head of the CCS programme at the French Institute of Petroleum.",
12201,“Subsidies are needed to accelerate the implementation of this technology.”,
12202,"The cost is even higher for direct capture from the air – up to €335 per tonne of CO2 – because direct capture from the air requires a lot of energy, since CO2 is not highly concentrated in the air.Nevertheless, costs could fall below €100 per tonne by 2030 for facilities benefitting from large renewable energy resources, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).",
12203,And it takes a long time to make storage locations operational.,
12204,"“You’ve got to collect a lot of data to have enough confidence in a site; all in all, it can take about a decade,” said Le Guénan, who is currently studying a potential storage area in Grandpuits in the Paris region as part of an the EU’s project.",
12205,‘Essential’ or a ‘risky bet’?,
12206,"At the same time, many people do not like the idea of CO2 storage sites in many people's local area due to fears of gas leaks and lower house prices.",
12207,Fierce opposition from local populations to proposed projects has already been seen in Germany and The Netherlands.,
12208,Many environmentalists are also sceptical.,
12209,"“Manufacturers see CCS as a way of carrying on with the same production model, when it would be better to reduce energy consumption while recycling industrial materials,” said Léa Mattieu, head of the heavy industry programme at the NGO Climate Action Network.",
12210,"“It’s a risky bet,” Léa Mattieu, head of the heavy industry programme at the NGO Climate Action Network continued.",
12211,“Manufacturers have been talking about this technology for several decades – and we haven’t really seen the results come to fruition.,
12212,"this technology is still too expensive and this technology may well end up being a last resort solution, just for heavy industry.”",
12213,"Indeed, as things stand this technology plays a marginal role in reducing CO2 emissions and this technology's potential for development remains unproven.",
12214,"At present only around 30 large-scale installations are at work across the world, capable of capturing and storing some 40 million tonnes a year.",
12215,"In order to achieve carbon neutrality, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).",
12216,"And, 50 or even 100 times more than some 40 million tonnes a year needs to be captured and stored by 2035.",

12806,There will be a process for the negotiated disarmament of the Tigrayan fighters.,
12807,"Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's ascendancy is marked by the fact that The deal is with the party ruling the region - the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), not - as the Tigrayans had wanted - the ""Government of Tigray"".",
12808,"Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed is rejecting the 2020 elections in Tigray, won by the party ruling the region - the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), and planning for a new poll.",
12809,"However, the Ethiopian government had demanded the complete surrender of the party ruling the region - the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF).",
12810,the Ethiopian government did not achieve the complete surrender of the TPLF.,
12811,The deal emphasises that both parties will abide by the existing federal constitution.,
12812,This includes resolving the status of areas such as the agriculturally rich western Tigray - seized by the neighbouring Amhara region during the early weeks of the brutal war in the north of the country - by constitutional means.,
12813,The deal does not say whether the Tigrayan administration - and the farmers driven out - will return first.,
12814,The humanitarian element of The deal opens the door to ending the starvation and deprivation that have cost the lives of as many as a million people.,
12815,"as many as a million people includes perhaps 10% of Tigray's population of around six million, according to research published by academics in Belgium.",
12816,"After two years of blockade and starvation, and under relentless military pressure from the joint forces of the Ethiopian and Eritrean armies plus forces from the neighbouring Amhara region, Tigrayan leaders made huge concessions.",
12817,Tigrayan leaders's calculation appears to be that the survival of the people of Tigray was at stake.,
12818,"More than a million have been displaced since fighting resumed in August, unable to harvest their crops.",
12819,People are dying of treatable diseases as hospitals run out of basic drugs such as insulin and antibiotics.,
12820,There was no sign of this ending.,
12821,"For the millions who have been deprived of food, medicine and other basic services, essential aid cannot come a day too soon.",
12822,There are many unanswered questions.,
12823,Three are particularly crucial.,
12824,First is Eritrea.,
12825,"According to Western diplomats, the military offensive that broke Tigrayan defence lines was a joint Eritrean-Ethiopian operation directed from Asmara.",
12826,Eritrea is not mentioned by name in The deal.,
12827,"But the text includes a provision for ending ""collusion with any external force hostile to either party"", which could presumably refer to Eritrea.",
12828,Many will be sceptical that the Ethiopian government has the means to implement this.,
12829,Eritrean President Isaias Afewerki is not party to The deal and has the means to pursue the brutal war in the north of the country regardless of any agreement reached by Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed.,
12830,Second is monitoring and verification.,
12831,The deal is a triumph for the Ethiopian government's diplomatic strategy of keeping the international community at bay.,
12832,"The mechanism for monitoring, verification and compliance consists only of a small unit - maximum 10 persons - who report to the African Union (AU) panel chaired by Nigeria's former President Olusegun Obasanjo.",
12833,"In turn, Nigeria's former President Olusegun Obasanjo's mandate is from the AU Commission chairperson Moussa Faki, not the AU Peace and Security Council.",

12835,Assessing reports of violations and adjudicating disputes will be at the discretion of two men - Nigeria's former President Olusegun Obasanjo and the AU Commission chairperson Moussa Faki - an unusual oversight mechanism to say the least.,
12836,It is standard practice for high-level peace agreements to be witnessed by international partners.,
12837,"The EU was barred from observing, even though The EU is African Union (AU)'s largest donor.",
12838,the Ethiopian government and African Union (AU) will be counting on international endorsement nonetheless - not least because the Ethiopian government desperately needs foreign aid.,
12839,Third is justice and accountability.,
12840,"The deal provides for the Ethiopian government to establish a ""comprehensive national transitional justice policy"", making no mention of any international investigations, for example by the UN Human Rights Council or the African Commission on Human and People's Rights.",
12841,The prospect for peace and an end to the atrocities and starvation in Tigray and the stabilisation of the Ethiopian government depends largely on the good faith of the Ethiopian government.,
12842,"An early test will be the Ethiopian government's promise only to make joint public statements with the party ruling the region - the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) and to put an end to ""hostile propaganda, rhetoric and hate speech"".",
12843,Tigrayans at home and in the diaspora have greeted The deal with dismay.,
12844,It is possible that some Tigrayan commanders would rather continue guerrilla war than submit to what some Tigrayan commanders regard as humiliating peace terms.,
12845,"Others fear that the lesson that Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, Mr Isaias and others will have learned is the opposite - namely that overwhelming force, sustained starvation and an information blackout are effective weapons in pursuit of their objectives.",
12846,"Ethiopians will be hoping that overwhelming force, sustained starvation and an information blackout are not applied to solve other political challenges, including the continuing insurgency in the Oromia region.",
12847,The deal is founded on faith that Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed will lead the Ethiopian government out of the Ethiopian government's crisis.,
12848,That did not happen.,
12849,"Instead Thursday saw fierce fighting, including large-scale attacks by the Ethiopian and Eritrean armies on three fronts, sources in the region say.",

13175,"the La Niña phenomenon, the weather pattern that tends to bring lower rainfall in the country’s key producing regions is especially felt in the zona núcleo, the “core zone” located in the centre-east of Argentina, where wheat, corn and soybean production are concentrated.",

13178,"However, for soybean, long Argentina's star crop, a recovery in production is foreseen, with a likely increase in area sown for the first time in six years.But these remain projections, and for the time being there is no consensus among specialists on the true impact that the drought will have on Argentina's economy.",
13179,"The effects, specialists argue, will depend to a large extent on international prices.",
13180,"This is not the first time a “trilogy” of La Niña has been seen in modern times, with La Niña striking thrice from 1973 to 1976 and 1998 to 2001.",
13181,"But unlike those cycles, this time La Niña is occurring in the context of intensifying climate change.",
13182,"Although there is no direct link between the two phenomena, understanding the two phenomena's interaction is the subject of ongoing research.For INTA’s Mercuri, the current problem for Argentine soils is related to “cumulative” effects that have occurred over recent years.",
13183,“What we see in the last decade is that the word ‘record’ has entered the vocabulary: record rainfall or record lack of water.,
13184,"The impact on cropsAccording to the experts consulted, a return to a normal rainfall pattern may not occur until the first few months of next year.In the World Meteorological Organization's August bulletin, the World Meteorological Organization stated that the probability of the current La Niña episode continuing was 70 percent for September to November, gradually decreasing to 55 percent for the following quarter, from December to February 2023.",
13185,The timing of La Niña passing will have a vital impact on Argentina's current crop season.,
13186,"The biggest effect, for now, is on wheat, whose cycle traditionally runs from May to December.A recent release by the Buenos Aires Grain Exchange estimated that wheat production will stand at 17.5 million tonnes – the lowest figure in the last seven years – “as a result of the absence of rainfall.",
13187,"”“We are heading towards a production disaster,” said Cristián Russo, head of the Strategic Guide for Agriculture (GEA), a service of the Rosario Stock Exchange, adding that, unlike other seasons, the effects of La Niña “were not compensated for by other [weather] events”.",
13188,"Although with less intensity than in wheat, whose cycle traditionally runs from May to December, setbacks are also this situation for the output of corn, which is sown between September and October.",
13189,the Rosario Stock Exchange similarly attributed this situation mainly to “the sustained lack of water.”,
13190,"Faced with this situation, many corn producers will likely opt for a late sowing, and planted areas may even break new records, according to the same the Rosario Stock Exchange (BCR) report.",
13191,"Pablo Mercuri, from INTA, made a similar prediction, stating that there will be a “massive migration” towards second cropping – the sowing during winter – of corn.Meanwhile the production of soybean, a crop that is less sensitive to water deficit, is expected to expand.",
13192,"the Buenos Aires Grain Exchange has estimated a 10 percent increase in total output, a turnaround after several cycles of declines.",
13193,"Soybeans will also benefit from areas normally planted with wheat, whose cycle traditionally runs from May to December that have been lost to drought.",
13194,"The impact in numbersThe changes caused by the drought will have an impact on the Argentine economy, although given the uncertainty of international prices, it is difficult to estimate the scale.Agricultural consultant Néstor Roulet estimates losses amounting to US$3.3 billion, considering the consequences for wheat, corn and soya.",
13195,"Agricultural consultant Néstor Roulet took into account not only the changes in the sown area, but also the lower yields generated by the water deficit.For the Buenos Aires Grain Exchange, the expected drop could be higher: according to a report presented to national authorities, the expected drop will amount to US$4 billion, which would present a nine-percent fall compared to the previous season.Argentina draft budget for 2023, meanwhile, does not provide a precise figure, but the text presented to Congress suggests a more optimistic view than the estimates of the private sector.Given the volatility of international conditions, observers will likely only gain a clearer picture of the full extent of the impacts of Argentina's ongoing drought once final figures arrive in 2023.",

14064,"Only a few years ago, when Mauricio Macri was president, they tried to eliminate the electoral system themselves only to find they were incapable of doing so, as a video circulated by La Cámpora political youth organisation reminded us this week.Argentina’s's electoral system has included “obligatory” primaries since 2009, a move that was pushed by Cristina Fernández de Kirchner's administration.",
14065,"As usual, the new model was seen by the opposition as an attempt by Néstor Kirchner and Néstor Kirchner's wife to consolidate Néstor Kirchner and his wife's power, which in turn strengthened a two-party system that has morphed into “bi-coalitionism” that has dominated Argentine politics, at least over the last two decades.",
14066,"An important element of the new electoral law that was criticised back then by several future allies of Néstor Kirchner and his wife had to do with excluding parties with less than 1.5 percent of the vote in the PASO primaries from competing in the real elections, meaning the new model reduced the fragmentation of big parties, which was supposed to benefit the Frente para la Victoria (the coalition led by the Kirchners).",

14069,"Not only is ‘PASO’ incredibly costly, especially in an electoral system that includes a general election every two years (midterms and national), ‘PASO’ also dramatically extends the electoral calendar with many of the last presidential elections heading to run-offs, meaning there are three presidential election rounds some years.Another interesting characteristic of an electoral system that includes a general election every two years (midterms and national) is that under certain circumstances an electoral system that includes a general election every two years (midterms and national) has a tendency to define the election ahead of time.",
14070,"When Mauricio Macri was humiliated by her hand-picked president, Alberto Fernández and CFK in 2019, the expectation that pan-Peronism would return to power led to an aggressive run on the peso, which in turn exacerbated the economic catastrophe that the Mauricio Macri administration was already facing.",

14082,"While Brazil’s soon-to-be ex-president Jair Bolsonaro's undisputed leadership is surviving defeat intact, the supreme opposition confidence here regarding victory next year has bred a plethora of presidential hopefuls – a quintet of declared competitors at least without counting the dark horses (or Macri).",
14083,"But perhaps the key difference with Brazil is that while last Sunday’s's run-off crowned a convergence towards extreme polarisation, Argentine politics are moving in the opposite direction, thus making next year elections rather less of a done deal than opposition hopefuls might fondly imagine.",
14084,"opposition hopefuls still dwell in a yesteryear when the authoritarian drive of the second Cristina Fernández de Kirchner term against the Judiciary, the media and private property among other targets led directly to the creation of Cambiemos (the original name of the current opposition coalition with the same partners).",

14104,"I’ll start with a cyclical question about the tension surrounding the wage bargaining with the teamsters, which finally ended up with a 107 percent hike, above Raquel ‘Kelly’ Olmos, Argentina’s brand-new Labour minister and a fundamental Peronist cadre's own government’s inflation forecast of 95 percent for this year.",
14105,"If taken since the wage bargaining agreement was last updated from May to May, the wage bargaining agreement is for an 85 percent annual increase plus a one-off bonus of 100,000 pesos, which will be paid in four instalments.",
14106,So finally similar to inflation ...Exactly.,
14107,"Raquel ‘Kelly’ Olmos, Argentina’s brand-new Labour minister and a fundamental Peronist cadre's predecessor had a singular record for Argentina’s of almost three years in the Labour Ministry without major labour conflicts.",
14108,"How do Raquel ‘Kelly’ Olmos, Argentina’s brand-new Labour minister and a fundamental Peronist cadre imagine the just over a year remaining in the Alberto Fernández’s Presidency working out?I imagine collective wage bargaining with strong and important dynamics, obviously due to the high inflation.",
14109,But strong and important dynamics are truly producing very positive results since the sectors of both workers and businessmen are reaching agreement.,
14110,There might be some more or less tense situations and even conflict during the negotiations.,
14111,That’s OK but the most important thing is how some more or less tense situations and even conflict during the negotiations are finally resolved.,
14112,"Raquel ‘Kelly’ Olmos, Argentina’s brand-new Labour minister and a fundamental Peronist cadre believe in effect that the mechanism of resolution strengthens the democratic process because things are properly resolved.",
14113,"We are undergoing a more complex situation than during the three previous Peronist governments under Néstor Kirchner and Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, yet there was more conflict beforehand than now.",
14114,"To what do Raquel ‘Kelly’ Olmos, Argentina’s brand-new Labour minister and a fundamental Peronist cadre attribute that?On the one hand, conflicts in general have to do with the possibility of improving wages because when jobs are lacking, there tends to be less conflict.",
14115,"In that event there is some kind of social explosion afterwards, but the struggle for wages is much more active when closer to full employment, which is a general characteristic of all societies.",
14116,"Here we have a particular situation – firstly, we received an inheritance of a whole bunch of restrictions from the Mauricio Macri presidency, which had no pandemic nor war to worry about but nevertheless handed over to us a government conditioned by a severe crisis on Argentina’s's external front, somewhat camouflaged by the agreement with the International Monetary Fund, but wages lost over 20 percent of wages's purchasing-power on average.",
14117,"On coming to office Alberto Fernández’s immediately tried to tone up demand via a generalised wage increase, the Tarjeta Alimentar food stamps and a pension increase, but just when we were entering into a process of recovery, the pandemic came along.",
14118,"During the pandemic, when job protection was the most  important thing, Argentina’s even financed wages with a moratorium, the IFE emergency family assistance and transfer mechanisms for informal sectors.",
14119,All the work went on trying to reduce the damage from the need for isolation ahead of the existence of vaccines.,
14120,Afterwards we pushed a very vigorous process of economic recovery.,
14121,"We might recall that many economists said that we were going to take four or five years to recover the losses from the pandemic, and we managed to recover in only one year.",
14122,"The reality is that we burned up a very high level of reserves, gambling on the success of  demonstrating the vigour of the Argentine productive system in being able to recover so quickly.",
14123,"[This year] 2022 was thus always going to be the year for accumulating reserves, also according to our pact with the International Monetary Fund, because we all know that the crises on the external front are what destabilise Argentina’s so it became very important to strengthen our foreign currency reserves.",
14124,"Neither had we foreseen war with the Russian invasion of Ukrainian territory, which had an enormous impact on food and, above all, fuel prices, which signified an imbalance in our foreign trade with over US$5 billion which had been earmarked for boosting our reserves going on the purchase of energy.",
14125,"But we succeeded in avoiding any shortages in the access to energy, either from the viewpoint of the citizenry or the productive system.",
14126,Now we are making an effort.,
14127,All this creates tensions and imbalances which express themselves in an inflationary process which the world has not known for four decades.,
14128,"In Argentina’s, with an impact of those characteristics, amplified by our structural inflation, we now have to work hard on stabilisation, and that is the effort of our entire government with restrictions which do not affect growth nor our capacity for job creation.",
14129,"You have to be present to see how workers and management have reached a culture of dialogue and agreement, projecting a very virtuous model.",
14130,"When we are so used to ferocious criticisms of Argentina’s every day, I realise that we have very important democratic reserves.",
14131,"Does the capacity to resolve, for example, a conflict like the teamsters – originally asking for an annual increase of 137 percent yet settling for 107 percent but over 16 months but 85 percent annually plus a bonus of 100,000 pesos placing the teamsters around four percent ahead for the year, along with the approval of a budget exempting the travel expenses of truck-drivers from income tax – does all this mean that you have finally found the way around inflation?Yes, with rational and objective work and above all with our leaders practised in dialogue, both businessmen and workers.",
14132,The truth is that Argentina’s has an exemplary labour movement.,
14133,The countries with weakened labour movements have deteriorated as democracies.,
14134,"We have many deficits and pending issues but we can display a vigorous labour movement, which also corresponds to a business world often not given the visibility a business world often not given the visibility it deserves deserves.",
14135,Because in the construction of public opinion there often appear some big businessmen who hardly represent businessmen as a whole who work daily side by side with workers to reach agreements.,
14136,"Consulting Raquel ‘Kelly’ Olmos, Argentina’s brand-new Labour minister and a fundamental Peronist cadre as an economist, help me to understand the job problems in Argentina’s in recent years.",
14137,"We come from the same generation, so we can both remember the year 1974 as the last year when Argentina’s had four percent poverty, a per capita income comparable to Australia or Canada and seven million in private-sector registered employment.",
14138,Nearly 50 years later today seven million in private-sector registered employment are still seven million with double the the year 1974 population.,
14139,"What is Raquel ‘Kelly’ Olmos, Argentina’s brand-new Labour minister and a fundamental Peronist cadre's macro-economic analysis of this situation?The international context has changed fundamentally.",
14140,You are quite right to highlight the year 1974.,
14141,"It should be remembered that the year 1974 was the period of the oil crisis, rupturing the dynamics of the International Labour Organisation  when the International Labour Organisation were developing an import substitution which dynamised the Argentine productive system, as Raquel ‘Kelly’ Olmos, Argentina’s brand-new Labour minister and a fundamental Peronist cadre have very well described.",
14142,"The 1974 oil crisis fundamentally impoverished Europe, which was the most affected.",
14143,"At that time Europe, which was the most affected was Argentina’s's leading importer with Argentina’s's main export beef.",
14144,"Argentina’s's annual exports were then, if Raquel ‘Kelly’ Olmos, Argentina’s brand-new Labour minister and a fundamental Peronist cadre remember correctly, around US$500 million.",
14145,"As from that winter beef became a luxury in Europe, which was the most affected and Argentine exports plunged while a high level of imports was required because, thanks to the programme of stabilisation of (then-economy minister José Ber) Gelbard, Argentina’s had an extremely high level of economic activity and, in consequence, needed to import many inputs and capital goods.",
14146,"That triggered an external crisis which ended up in the Rodrigazo price instability, which served as the excuse for a coup d’état, which also wanted to make Peronism and the movement disappear in a holocaust of over 30,000 comrades.",
14147,"They established or installed Argentina’s within a system of speculative flight capital, a process of clearly speculative indebtedness which the Peronist government had not wanted to adopt.",
14148,"You will recall that it was the tablita exchange rate sliding scale of [junta Economy Minister José] Martínez de Hoz, where the differential between an exchange rate known in advance and very high interest rates favoured a tremendous process of going into debt very similar to what happened recently with the Mauricio Macri administration.",
14149,"Thereafter, the debt is nationalised while the hard currency thus acquired is transformed into the creation of external assets or capital flight, as it is more vulgarly known.",
14150,"That knocked the structure out of the Argentine productive system, deepening what Marcelo Diamand has called the imbalanced economic structure.",
14151,"Today we must revert that situation by strongly modifying the inheritance of the productive matrix remaining from that period and incorporating dynamic new sectors for the international market in order for the access to hard currency not to be concentrated in the farm export sector, as the access to hard currency is now.",
14152,"In that sense we must again boost the competitive capacity of Argentina’s's industrial sector, promoting and adding value to the mining and lithium sectors and the knowledge economy, which is the focus of Argentina’s.",
14153,"Raquel ‘Kelly’ Olmos, Argentina’s brand-new Labour minister and a fundamental Peronist cadre, the military dictatorship lasted seven years and we have had 50 years of neo-decadence.",
14154,"Isn’t there something more to it?Yes, the strong imbalance between how quickly things can be destroyed and how long it takes to rebuild things.",
14155,It also has to do with the institutional system.,
14156,"For example, in the first government of [Juan Domingo] Perón, the electoral system was governed by the Sáenz Peña law whereby the winner took two-thirds of the seats even if ahead by only vote – in consequence, a system slanted towards governability.",
14157,"We have currently evolved towards a much more representative system, which has the system’s's virtues but has weakened the system’s ability to respond to governance issues.",
14158,"This is not just limited to Argentina’s, it’s pretty general, expressed today in the discontent of majorities with ineffective systems...  The limited capacity the governments have to transform?Exactly.",
14159,A system more geared to representation than governance reproduces the status quo or at least that’s what we see to be happening.,
14160,"Raquel ‘Kelly’ Olmos, Argentina’s brand-new Labour minister and a fundamental Peronist cadre obviously share the idea that things are destroyed much faster than things are constructed but aren’t there other more structural motives to explain the number of people without access to a registered job in the private sector, as well as the number in the underground or “popular” economy or the self-employed?",
14161,"For example, the structure of globalisation, in which it is impossible for developing countries to compete with the likes of China, Raquel ‘Kelly’ Olmos, Argentina’s brand-new Labour minister and a fundamental Peronist cadre think that the development of China had characteristics which affected us because developing countries's competition was initially far more based on cheap labour than technological development – that has gone varying since.",
14162,"Are we entering a positive cycle because China's level of development no longer hinges on cheap labour while food and other inputs begin to be bought?Thanks to their having generated a positive social mobility, they need food of better quality like what we could supply.",
14163,That’s why the challenge is not to sell  animal feed but those proteins which can go directly to supermarket shelves in the form of food with added value.,
14164,"the pandemic has also had a huge impact in modifying the chain … Via globalisation.Within the global system of production, and Raquel ‘Kelly’ Olmos, Argentina’s brand-new Labour minister and a fundamental Peronist cadre believe there’s going to be a..",
14165,.,
14166,"A return to a closer supply chain.More regional and continental, which should be observed very closely.",
14167,In an interview within this same series the current PRO chair Patricia Bullrich said that at the IDEA business symposium the current PRO chair Patricia Bullrich heard several trade unionists say that labour reform was necessary.,
14168,"Obviously what kind of labour reform would then need to be discussed but what is Raquel ‘Kelly’ Olmos, Argentina’s brand-new Labour minister and a fundamental Peronist cadre's view as to the need for labour reform and if so, what kind?Any system for organising labour can always be perfected and should adapt labour reform to the dynamics of the context.",
14169,"In Raquel ‘Kelly’ Olmos, Argentina’s brand-new Labour minister and a fundamental Peronist cadre's view labour reform should be updated via collective bargaining agreements.",
14170,"But Raquel ‘Kelly’ Olmos, Argentina’s brand-new Labour minister and a fundamental Peronist cadre don’t agree with the proposals expressed by Mauricio Macri in Mauricio Macri's latest book, which is heading towards a society without rights.",
14171,"Raquel ‘Kelly’ Olmos, Argentina’s brand-new Labour minister and a fundamental Peronist cadre don’t believe that is good.",
14172,"When you speak with leaders of the “popular economy” who propose the idea of permanent self-employment, leaders of the “popular economy” who propose the idea of permanent self-employment tell you that it is necessary to register the enormous number of people who cannot be employed via the traditional system of companies as formally self-employed.",
14173,"What is Raquel ‘Kelly’ Olmos, Argentina’s brand-new Labour minister and a fundamental Peronist cadre's opinion regarding self-employment as a cycle, a crutch within a process of development  or something which should be permanent?I hope self-employment’s a process of transition because self-employment confers fewer rights than formal employment.",
14174,"It seems to Raquel ‘Kelly’ Olmos, Argentina’s brand-new Labour minister and a fundamental Peronist cadre an effort which must be made.",
14175,"In fact, in Argentina’s today formal employment is growing at an annual rate of six percent, which is very vigorous and very good and we have to make an enormous effort to make informal employment and self-employment a transit route towards formal employment, with rights.",
14176,"Let me take advantage of all Raquel ‘Kelly’ Olmos, Argentina’s brand-new Labour minister and a fundamental Peronist cadre's experience as a Peronist cadre beyond the Labour Ministry.",
14177,"How do Raquel ‘Kelly’ Olmos, Argentina’s brand-new Labour minister and a fundamental Peronist cadre see Peronism today and the internal differences within what we might call pan-Peronism?",
14178,Constructing institutional leadership has always been a very big challenge for Peronism and we’re seeing how we can face up to that  difficulty today.,
14179,"To what do Raquel ‘Kelly’ Olmos, Argentina’s brand-new Labour minister and a fundamental Peronist cadre attribute that  difficulty’s because we have a culture which has always been very associated with personal leadership and we need to make the transition towards a more institutional construction but the transition towards a more institutional construction’s proving difficult for us.",
14180,"Raquel ‘Kelly’ Olmos, Argentina’s brand-new Labour minister and a fundamental Peronist cadre were named as a minister along with two other women and the whole press commented that it was the sole decision of the president without consulting the other two important Frente de Todos leaders, namely Cristina Fernández de Kirchner and Sergio Massa.",
14181,"the president proposed Raquel ‘Kelly’ Olmos, Argentina’s brand-new Labour minister and a fundamental Peronist cadre for a Cabinet post and Raquel ‘Kelly’ Olmos, Argentina’s brand-new Labour minister and a fundamental Peronist cadre accepted.",
14182,The biggest responsibility of all those you’ve had.Sincerely.,
14183,"Do Raquel ‘Kelly’ Olmos, Argentina’s brand-new Labour minister and a fundamental Peronist cadre think Alberto Fernández’s will be among those running in the PASO primaries?Yes, beyond doubt Alberto Fernández’s could be an option for next year.",
14184,"It seems to Raquel ‘Kelly’ Olmos, Argentina’s brand-new Labour minister and a fundamental Peronist cadre that is what is called for.",
14185,"And so how would Raquel ‘Kelly’ Olmos, Argentina’s brand-new Labour minister and a fundamental Peronist cadre imagine that amalgam then?By agreeing on the ground rules.",
14186,"That is what you see in collective bargaining – when there is clarity as to the ground rules and a methodology accepted by all sides, you get results.",
14187,"So would collective bargaining be the ground rules in that sense?In collective bargaining there are ground rules which have been incorporated, accepted and matured by both sides.",
14188,In the case of politics we also have to agree on ground rules to favour a process which permits us to grow in unity.,
