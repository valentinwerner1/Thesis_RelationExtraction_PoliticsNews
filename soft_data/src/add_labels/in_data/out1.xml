Windows and windscreens were smashed in.The BBC saw half a dozen bodies lying at the scene, apparently civilians. Baggage and coats strewed the tarmac. One survivor told the BBC her boss had been killed in the attack."She had two kids. I left the cafe to use the restroom when it happened. I ran back and tried to find her. The cafe was demolished, there were many bodies around. It was all so very horrifying," Viktoriia Yosypenko said.Reacting to the attack in the early hours of Friday on the outskirts of the regional capital of the Zaporizhzhia region, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia was a "state-terrorist".He said Russia launched 16 rockets on the city, and vowed to punish perpetrators for "every lost Ukrainian life".Meanwhile, a Russian-installed local official blamed Ukraine for the attack.The convoy was hit as people were preparing to travel to the Russian-occupied part of the region to pick up their relatives and also deliver humanitarian aid.Tears and despair as Russian annexation loomsNear the missile's impact crater, the BBC spoke to Kateryna Holoborod, sat on her suitcase in a state of shock. 'We arrived in a line, to join a column going towards Kherson," she said. "We got out to see what number we had in the queue. Then the first rocket hit, behind the wagons. "We dropped to the ground. Then the second one hit in the centre of the queue. There was glass everywhere, people screaming and running. I don't remember much. "It was very scary. I then got up to see what happened, help the injured. I tried to help an injured young man when the third explosion happened."The attack comes as Russian President Vladimir Putin is preparing for a signing ceremony in Moscow to annex Zaporizhzhia along with Ukraine's Donetsk, Luhansk and Kherson regions.The move follows self-styled referendums in the eastern and southern regions, which have been condemned by Ukraine and the West as a sham.Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February, and Moscow currently controls the majority of the Zaporizhzhia region, including Europe's biggest nuclear power plant there - but not the regional capital.Moscow-installed regional official Vladimir Rogov blamed "Ukrainian militants" for the Zaporizhzhia attack, Russian state-run media reported.In a separate development, one person was killed and five injured in overnight Russian strikes by Iskander missiles on the central city of Dnipro, about 70km (43 miles) north of Zaporizhzhia, local officials said.They said a transport company was targeted, and as many as 52 buses were burnt and another 98 damaged.Several high-rise buildings, offices and a shop were also hit.You may also be interested in: </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Raffi Berg"><Text>About 20 members of a Jewish sect held at a facility in Mexico after a police raid on their jungle base have fled.Footage showed men, women, and children streaming out of the site in Huixtla, in the west, on Wednesday night.They had been there since the raid last Friday when two members were arrested on suspicion of human trafficking and serious sexual offences.The sect, Lev Tahor, is known for extremist practices and imposing a strict regime on its followers.It advocates child marriage, inflicts harsh punishments even for minor transgressions and requires women and girls as young as three years old to completely cover up with robes.Local media said members of the group had been protesting against their detention since their arrival, including rioting and assaulting personnel.Video from Reuters news agency shows the detainees, dressed in gold, grey and white robes, forcing their way past two guards at a gate as one of their members holds it open.One of the guards trying to hold them back falls down and the group climb over him as they make their escape. A youth is seen turning and kicking the guard as he lies on the ground.  It is unclear where the group has gone. Associated Press said they were collected by a lorry and headed towards the border with Guatemala, while news site El Heraldo de México said they went by foot for several miles before disappearing into the night.Their compound, 11 miles (17.5km) north of Tapachula in Chiapas state, was raided by an elite police unit after a months-long investigation and surveillance operation involving Mexican and Guatemalan authorities and a private four-man team from Israel including former Mossad and domestic intelligence agents.Twenty-six members were found at the site, among them Israelis with dual citizenships including Canada, the US and Guatemala, Israel's foreign ministry said.It said a Canadian and an Israeli citizen were arrested, while two other wanted members reportedly left the compound two days before the raid and are being sought. Five more were detained for allegedly breaking immigration rules.The operation stemmed from an appeal to a former member of Israel's domestic intelligence agency, Shin Bet, by a former member of the sect, Yisrael Amir.Mr Amir fled the group's base in Guatemala in 2020, having to leave his then one-year-old son there.His son was released in the raid last week and flown back to Israel with his father.The group had lived in Guatemala since 2014, but in January members illegally crossed into Mexico, settling in the jungle. The leadership in Guatemala has been at the centre of a kidnapping case since 2018. Nine of the sect's members have been charged, four of whom have so far been convicted. Lev Tahor - Hebrew for Pure of Heart - was formed in Israel in 1988 and is thought to number up to 350 members, according to an ex-members group.It has been forced to move from country to country in recent years after coming under scrutiny from local authorities. It is currently spread between Israel, the US, North Macedonia, Morocco, Mexico and Guatemala. Between 70 and 80 members are still in Guatemala.While the group is often described as ultra-Orthodox, it follows its own sets of rules and has been declared a "dangerous cult" by an Israeli court.Its leaders have denied breaking local laws and say the group is being targeted because of its beliefs.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="BBC News, author unspecified"><Text>The European Union has agreed to impose emergency measures to charge energy firms on their record profits.Ministers have agreed windfall taxes on certain energy companies as well as mandatory cuts in electricity use.The plan includes a levy on fossil fuel firms' surplus profits and a levy on excess revenues made from surging electricity costs. The cash raised is expected to go to families and businesses.But the bloc is divided on whether and how to cap the wholesale price of gas.It comes as Europe braces itself for a difficult winter due to the cost of living crisis and squeeze on global energy supplies.What is the windfall tax on oil and gas companies?Germany vows €65bn package to combat energy crisisThe bloc is largely trying to wean itself off Russia energy but it has left it scrambling for other alternative, expensive, sources.A windfall tax is imposed by a government on a company to target firms that were lucky enough to benefit from something they were not responsible for - in other words, a windfall profit. Energy firms are getting much more money for their oil and gas than they were last year, partly because demand has increased as the world emerges from the pandemic and more recently because of supply concerns due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.EU ministers estimate that they can raise €140bn (£123bn) from the levies on non-gas electricity producers and suppliers that are making larger-than-usual profits from the current demand.Earlier this month, the European Commission's vice-president, Frans Timmermans, said that fossil fuel extractors will be told to give back 33% of their surplus profits for this year. "The era of cheap fossil fuels is over. And the faster we move to cheap, clean and homegrown renewables, the sooner we will be immune to Russia's energy blackmail," he said."A cap on outsize revenues will bring solidarity from energy companies with abnormally high profits towards their struggling customers," he added. Earlier this week, 15 member states, including France and Italy, asked the EU to impose a price cap on gas bills to slow the soaring costs. A decision has not yet been announced on a price cap. "There is big disappointment that in the proposal that is on the table there is nothing about gas prices," Polish climate minister Anna Moskwa said.Ms Moskwa said a maximum price for gas would be supported by the majority of European countries and "cannot be ignored". In the UK, former Chancellor Rishi Sunak introduced a similar tax to Friday's EU agreement in May, which he called the Energy Profits Levy.It was applied to profits made by companies from extracting UK oil and gas, but not those that generate electricity from sources such as nuclear or wind power. </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="BBC News, author unspecified"><Text>A suicide attack at a tuition centre in the Afghan capital Kabul has killed at least 19 people, most of them female students, police and witnesses say.Nearly 30 others were wounded at the Kaaj education centre in the Dasht-e-Barchi area in the west of the city.Students had been sitting a practice university exam when the bomber struck. No group has yet claimed the attack.Many of those in the area are minority Hazaras, who have often been targeted by Islamic State (IS) militants.Footage on local TV and shared on social media appeared to show scenes from a nearby hospital, where rows of covered bodies were laid out on the floor. Other media reportedly from the site of the private college showed rubble and upturned tables in the damaged classrooms."We didn't find her here," a woman who was looking for her sister at one of the hospitals told AFP news agency. "She was 19 years old." Some reports say the number of dead is far higher than Taliban officials have acknowledged. The attacker is reported to have shot at the guards outside the centre, entered a classroom and detonated a bomb.Eyewitnesses told the BBC that most of the victims were girls - they were seated in the front row, near the blast. A student who was wounded told AFP that there were around 600 people in the room when the attack happened. The Kaaj tuition centre is a private college which teaches both male and female students. Most girls' schools in the country have been closed since the Taliban returned to power in August last year, but some private schools are open.Hazaras, most of whom are Shia Muslims, are Afghanistan's third largest ethnic group. They have long faced persecution from the regional affiliate of Islamic State (ISKP) and the Taliban, which both adhere to Sunni Islam. The pupils too afraid to return to schoolSunnis and Shia: Islam's ancient schismThe secret girls school defying the TalibanOn Friday the Taliban's interior ministry spokesman said security teams were at the site and condemned the attack.Abdul Nafy Takor said attacking civilian targets "proves the enemy's inhuman cruelty and lack of moral standards". The attack was also strongly condemned by the United Nations and the US. "Targeting a room full of students taking exams is shameful; all students should be able to pursue an education in peace and without fear," said Karen Decker, charge d'affaires at the US mission to Afghanistan, in a tweet. The security situation in Afghanistan, which had improved after the end of fighting following the Taliban takeover, has been deteriorating in recent months, with a number of attacks on civilians but also Taliban supporters. Some have been claimed by IS, which is a bitter rival of the Taliban.Schools and hospitals have been targeted in the Dasht-e-Barchi area in a series of attacks, most of which are thought to have been the work of IS.Last year - before the Taliban returned to power - a bomb attack on a girls school in Dasht-e-Barchi killed at least 85 people, mainly students, and wounded hundreds more.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Flora Drury"><Text>A rights group has called on Fifa to ban Iran from this year's World Cup after blocking women from watching games in their own country.Open Stadiums questioned why the country was being allowed to compete while "Iranian women remain locked out of our 'Beautiful Game'" by officials.The call comes weeks after women were allowed to attend a domestic match for the first time since 1979.However, the rights group was sceptical stadiums would remain open to women."Iranian women trust neither the Islamic Republic's authorities nor the Iranian Football Federation that the Azadi stadium will remain open to them after the Fifa World Cup 2022 concludes on December 18," Open Stadiums said in an open letter to Fifa's president, Gianni Infantino.It also argues that even those who travel to Qatar to watch matches risk falling foul of Iranian authorities, with fears state spies may keep tabs on those who attend.Prohibiting women from games goes against international football rules, the letter points out, arguing Fifa should "immediately expel Iran from the World Cup 2022 in Qatar" as a result.What happens when sport and politics collide in IranIranian news sites reported speculation that women were allowed to attend the match in August after Fifa sent a letter to authorities calling on them to permit more women into stadiums. Fifa has previously told the BBC it would not "turn its eyes" away from the issue.There is no official ban on women going to sporting events in Iran, but it is rare as they are often refused entry.Prior to this, women had effectively been barred from domestic matches where men are playing due to clerical disapproval under the Shia Muslim regime. Women have attended a handful of international matches, including one in March this year, news agency Reuters reports.The rights group, which campaigns for equal access to sport in Iran, also claimed in the letter that members of the football team going to Qatar later this year had been banned from speaking out over deadly protests currently rocking the country. They were sparked by the death in custody of a young woman, Mahsa Amini, after she was detained morality police.The letter points out that the detention centre where she died is the same one "where female fans are usually brought to and tortured if we dare to try to attend a football game".Neither the Iranian football association or Fifa have responded to a request for comment from Reuters.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Christy Cooney"><Text>Comedian Trevor Noah has announced he is standing down as host of The Daily Show. Noah said he was "filled with gratitude for the journey" but that there was "another part of my life that I want to carry on exploring".The 38-year-old has hosted the satirical news and talk show since taking over from Jon Stewart in 2015. He said the timing of his departure would be announced later and that he would continue as host in the meantime. Noah began his career in his native South Africa, releasing a string of stand-up specials and hosting a late-night talk show before relocating to the US in 2011. He was still a relative unknown when he was chosen to take over the Daily Show on the Comedy Central network, but has since become an internationally-recognised star and won numerous television awards. Noah made the announcement at the end of his show on Thursday night, prompting shocked gasps from the studio audience.He thanked the show's crew and loyal fans for an "amazing seven years", adding: "It's been wild, truly wild". "I remember when we first started... so many people didn't believed in us," he said. "[Appointing me as host] was a crazy bet to make. I still think it was a crazy choice, this random African. "I just [find] myself filled with gratitude for the journey. It's been absolutely amazing. It's something that I never expected."The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterHe said that after everything that has happened during his time hosting the show - including Donald Trump's presidency and the Covid pandemic - he had decided his "time is up, but in the most beautiful way". "I've loved hosting this show, it's been one of my greatest challenges, it's been one of my greatest joys. But after seven years, I feel like it's time," he said. "I realised there's another part of my life that I want to carry on exploring. I miss learning other languages, I miss going to other countries and putting on shows. I miss just being everywhere and doing everything."I'm really grateful to a network who believed in this random comedian nobody knew on this side of the world."I never dreamed that I would be here. I sort of felt like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. I came in for a tour of what the previous show was, and then the next thing I know I was handed the keys."All I can say is thank you very much."</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By James Waterhouse"><Text>Every day, convoys of people arrive in a supermarket car park in Zaporizhzhia city, escorted in by police vehicles. They've made the hazardous trip out of Russian-occupied territory in southern Ukraine, finally reaching the relative safety of this regional capital still firmly under Ukrainian control.And yet this is one of four Ukrainian regions that Russia is formally annexing, after a five-day exercise it called a referendum and Ukraine and the West condemned as a sham.Among those handing their papers to police is Anton Osenev, who says the Russians tried to mobilise him twice to fight against his own country, around his home city of Melitopol. "We weren't home for the first attempt," he says. "On the second occasion they stayed at our house for some time". Had it not been for his pregnant wife being in the room, they would have taken him, he believes. His father is in the Ukrainian army, and if he had been seized he would have been on the opposite side."I still don't understand what's happening, we need some rest."Few here care about Moscow's declaration of annexation.  What they are afraid of is what the occupiers will do now to defend what they've taken - whether that is being forced to fight for Russia, or Moscow resorting to more lethal weapons.Last week Vladimir Putin threatened to use all resources at his disposal, even nuclear weapons.For the Kremlin, that's the very point - to create uncertainty over what comes next.As you drive south towards the front line from Zaporizhzhia city, the roads seem to empty.Fewer people walk along the roadside. A car or military vehicle occasionally speeds by. You don't go for leisurely drives around here.What you do get more of are military checkpoints. Ukrainian forces use them to control who gets through, and work out who is coming from the direction of Russian-occupied territory. After our military escort gets us through, we're met with an open, straight road.Half an hour later we arrive at the village of Komyshuvakha, a small settlement in the Ukrainian outback.A handful of damaged buildings hug a wide, straight highway. Most windows are boarded up. On this autumnal afternoon it's almost silent. If we carried on driving for 11 miles, we'd encounter a Russian checkpoint. An area Moscow now sees as its new "border" with Ukraine. Despite the region's capital staying under Ukrainian control, Russian forces control most of the Zaporizhzhia region. Today's annexation announcement is a continuation of their attempts to make their presence seem just. For those we meet in Komyshuvakha, nothing seems fair.One of them is Liubov Smyrnova. She tearfully takes us to a burnt-out shell which was once her home. It was hit by a missile in May. She's only just felt able to return. "I think that Putin's politics is to destroy us, it's a genocide of our people," she tells me, while sifting through fragments of shrapnel. "We are under constant pressure. I can't even describe it with words. Komyshuvakha is shelled almost every day."Most people are inside because strikes tend to happen in the middle of the day, we're told. For now, the sound of birdsong and the occasional bark of a dog masks what has happened to this small community. It dawns on you that it's mostly women left here. The men of Komyshuvakha are mostly fighting, or just elsewhere.Around the corner, we speak to three women outside the building they've lived in for 70 years. Their eyes moisten as the strain of life here bubbles to the surface. "Winter is coming and there's not a single window in the house," they explain, often talking over each other. "It's like we're sitting on a powder keg." So, what do they make of Russia's claim to half of the region they live in?"There should be a free and independent Ukraine," they say. "We didn't attack anyone, didn't hurt anyone, and didn't want anything. We want to live the way we did before."Behind a fire escape door in an empty kindergarten, there's activity. Through it are three women busily washing potatoes and cooking pancakes. They don't know who they're cooking for, they say, just that the Ukrainian military instructs them to. As she stirs batter in a large bowl, I ask Anzhela whether she cares that Russia now sees her village as being close to its new "border"."We don't want that," she says. "We want to live the way we lived. Everything was fine, everything was all right." She whisks with a bit more vigour. "We grew up this way. Our children grew up this way and our grandchildren too." </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Tiffanie Turnbull"><Text>Australia has said it will end mandatory Covid isolation requirements from next month.Currently anyone who tests positive to the virus must isolate for five days, but that will end from 14 October.At times nicknamed "Fortress Australia", the country has had some of the strictest restrictions in the world since the pandemic began. Australia's chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, said the "emergency phase" of its response was probably over. But Prof Kelly said the decision "does not in any way suggest that the pandemic is finished".Mandatory isolation had been one of the few restrictions remaining. Australia continues to record about 5,500 virus cases each day, official figures show. It is one of the world's most vaccinated countries.Prof Kelly said the country would see "future peaks" of the virus, but it currently had "very low" numbers of hospital admissions and aged-care outbreaks.The Australian Medical Association opposes the change, saying those who pushed for it are not "scientifically literate" and are putting lives at risk.About 15,000 people have died with the virus in Australia - fewer than many nations. The vast majority have happened this year after the country opened up. Australia had closed international borders for around two years and imposed strict limits on movement around the country.Australia revisited - a country changed by CovidIs Australia still a Covid success story? Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said most existing governments payments for people who have to miss work because of Covid would also be scrapped."It was always envisaged that these measures were emergency measures," he said.Casual workers and those in high-risk areas like aged care or health will still be able to get financial support.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Frances Mao"><Text>Women working at Australia's research camps in Antarctica have endured widespread sexual harassment, a report has found.It described evidence of uninvited touching, requests for sex, and a predatory culture which condoned pornography on walls and sexual taunts.Woman also felt they had to hide their menstruation, and ration tampons and pads because they were so limited.Officials have condemned the findings and vowed to bring on cultural change.Australia's Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek said she was "gobsmacked" by the independent review of Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) sites. It was instigated after individuals made complaints."As a minister, I take a zero-tolerance response to sexual harassment in any workplace I am responsible for," Ms Plibersek told the Australian Broadcasting Corp (ABC).Australia's Antarctic sites are located on the continent's eastern edge, and include the Casey, Davis and Mawson research stations. During the summer up to 500 expeditioners can be dispatched there, but during winter months the camps are reduced to about 15-30 key workers. Those workers - including doctors, chefs, and field officers - typically spend a year living at a station.Women in the camps felt like they couldn't escape or get immediate help due to the remote and isolated environment, said the report's author Meredith Nash, a professor at the Australian National University.They "have to work in the fields with their abusers for weeks at a time because they simply can't leave", she told the ABC, which first reported the findings on Friday."Or, because of the power dynamics, they are not in a position to make a complaint or get support immediately as they would do back home," she added.Sex harassment rife in Australia parliament - reportThe long-lasting effects of workplace sexual harassmentThe report also found a homophobic culture among the male-dominated field, and said people feared speaking out because they didn't want to be excluded from future expeditions.In such a masculine environment, women scientists felt pressure to hide their periods out of fear of male judgement, the review said.Women also had to "go through a gatekeeper to access free menstrual products" with a voucher request system, reflecting a lack of adequate support in basic camp infrastructure. AAD Director Kim Ellis said they were already putting in place the report's recommendations."I am deeply concerned by the experiences described at our workplaces where people have been sexually harassed, discriminated against and excluded," he said.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Malu Cursino"><Text>Morocco's culture ministry has accused Adidas of appropriating Moroccan culture in its new jerseys for Algeria's football team.Adidas said the design was inspired by the Mechouar Palace in Algeria.However the geometric blue, teal and yellow design is a pattern called zellige, which is common in Moroccan mosaics, the ministry's lawyer said.The neighbouring nations have a long history of tensions, as they continue to dispute Western Sahara. Lawyer Mourad Elajouti wrote on Facebook that he had issued a legal warning to Adidas, on behalf of Morocco's Ministry of Culture.In a letter to the company's chief executive Kasper Rorsted, Mr Elajouti said the new design was cultural appropriation and "an attempt to steal a form of Moroccan cultural heritage and use it outside its context".He has demanded the German sportswear brand remove the design within two weeks.Mr Elajouti added that Algeria's 2022-2023 season kit "contributes to the loss and distortion of the identity and history of these [zellige] cultural elements".The BBC has contacted Adidas for comment.Algeria and Morocco share a nearly 2,000 km (1,242 miles) border, which has been a source of tension since independence from French colonial rule.In 1963, they had the Sand War over Morocco's claim to territory in Algeria. Drugs, dates and disputes at mules' border crossingLater on, Algeria backed the Polisario Front's campaign for Western Sahara's independence from Morocco, leading to the 1975-1991 Western Sahara War.The border was then closed in 1994 for security reasons after militant Islamists bombed a hotel in the historic Moroccan city of Marrakesh.More recently, in 2021 Algeria cut diplomatic ties with its neighbour, accusing Morocco of "hostile acts". Morocco called the move "completely unjustified".</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Jonathan Josephs"><Text>The US has said it "seems" Russia is to blame for this week's leaks in the Nord Stream gas pipelines.US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm told the BBC an investigation was being carried out into the cause of what she called "an act of sabotage", adding "it is highly unlikely that these incidents are coincidence"No evidence about how the leaks happened has been made public.Russia has dismissed suggestions that it was to blame.It said claims it had damaged the pipelines were "stupid and absurd".Sweden finds new leak in Russian gas pipeline    EU ramps up pipeline security after mystery attacksHow can the world cope without Russian oil and gas?President Putin described the damage as "unprecedented sabotage, in fact, an act of international terrorism" during a phone call with Turkey's President Erdogan, according to the Kremlin, which added Russia plans to bring it up for "urgent discussion" at the UN Security Council.Earlier Russia's Foreign Ministry suggest it was the US that stood to benefit from the pipeline being out of action because it would be able to increase its own natural gas sales.The White House has dismissed such suggestions."It's probably most likely some form of sabotage," according to Mike Fulwood of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies."If there was one incident of a pipeline rupture of leak then accidental damage could be a possibility, it is very rare."The most likely cause of accidental damage is an anchor being dropped and dragging across the pipeline".He added that with multiple leaks in a short period of time "doesn't sound like it could be accidental, although theoretically it could be".The high water pressure at the bottom of sea makes a detonation difficult, according to energy engineering expert Professor Russell Johns of Penn State University. He says "it is not likely that the Russians detonated their own pipeline. They could have simply cut-off gas to the pipeline entrance" if they wanted to stop supplies.The money Russia continues to receive for its fossil fuels is helping fund its invasion of Ukraine. The gas escaping from the pipeline near the Danish island of Bornholm has been in the pipe since the beginning of September when Moscow closed it off, saying repairs were needed to a vital artery in supplying Europe's energy needs. Ms Granholm suggested the energy relationship between Russia and Europe was being consigned to history."I think Russia has proven itself to be an unreliable energy partner," she said."No country wants to take the risk of putting a significant amount of its energy demand to Russia's supply. I think this accelerates the EU's push to become energy independent through clean energy".The war in Ukraine has had a profound impact in pushing up global energy prices. They've been the biggest contributor to soaring inflation in the UK, Eurozone and US, something which is threatening to reduce global economic growth.The increasing cost of living has made political leaders around the world re-evaluate where they get their energy from, according to Ms Granholm, who was speaking from the International Atomic Energy Agency's Ministerial Conference in Vienna."Every country is looking at the risks associated with putting too many eggs in one basket or putting too many eggs in the basket of petro-dictators and the volatility of the fossil fuels that accrue from that. Everyone is looking to how they can become energy independent."Wind, solar and nuclear energy are among the alternatives many countries are trying to increase as they also aim to meet the Paris climate change targets.However an analysis by Columbia University suggests that Russia has a 46% share of global enrichment capacity for nuclear fuel, and the International Energy Agency warned in July that China has an 80% share "in all the key manufacturing stages of solar panels".When asked how the US and others don't end up overly reliant on such alternatives Ms Granholm replied that "this move to clean energy could be part of a great peace plan" and that such a move "helps people's pocketbooks, helps the economy, and helps energy security".This year's steep increases in the price of oil and gas have benefitted the energy giants who get them to consumers. In the first half of this year the combined profit of five of the biggest western energy firms, BP, Shell, Total, Chevron and Exxon almost tripled to just over $95.2bn with much of it going to shareholders.Ms Granholm said President Biden's administration wanted to see such companies lower prices at petrol pumps "so that citizens are not hurting".Despite acknowledging that oil is traded on a free market she called on them to help, "at least the American companies as good American citizens" and warned they could face a windfall tax similar to what has been seen in the UK."We don't want that huge amount of profit to end up triggering consequences, either Congressionally or elsewhere, that will not be in their interest."We want them to be responsible and not be buying back shares instead of increasing production, production that would ultimately reduce prices because of increasing supply. We are looking at legislative tools as well as otherwise pressuring them."One other way the US could help increase the supply of oil to global markets is by lifting some of the sanctions imposed on Venezuela by President Trump.The South American country has the world's largest oil reserves but has been exporting minimal amounts of oil because of the restrictions. They were enacted because of alleged corruption and the political fallout from 2019's contested election. An increase in supplies would be likely to push down global oil prices. When asked if it was time to lift the sanctions, Ms Granholm didn't dismiss the idea, replying: "I'm not going to get ahead of the White House on that."You can watch Jennifer Granholm's interview in full on Talking Business with Aaron Heslehurst this weekend.Viewers in the UK can watch the show at 15:30 on the BBC News Channel, and afterwards on BBC iPlayer.In other countries, it will be on BBC World News on Saturday at 23:30 GMT, Sunday at 05:30 and 16:30 GMT and Monday at 16:30 GMT.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="BBC News, author unspecified"><Text>A US army major doctor and her wife, a civilian doctor, have been charged with a plot to leak information to the Russian government. Jamie Lee Henry and Anna Gabrielian are accused of planning to share confidential information about patients at a military hospital. The pair allegedly told an undercover FBI agent that they were motivated by patriotism for Russia. Representatives of the couple have not yet commented on the case.There has been no comment from Russian authorities, either. The pair were charged with conspiracy and the disclosure of identifiable health information, in an indictment filed in a court in Baltimore, Maryland which was unsealed on Thursday after their arrest. Prosecutors said the couple wanted to help the Russian government "gain insights into the medical conditions of individuals associated with the US government and military".The indictment states that Maj Henry, 39, planned to use her security clearance to gain access to private medical records from the hospital at Fort Bragg, the large military base where she worked. Dr Gabrielian, 36, is accused of planning to share information from where she worked, believed to be Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. She allegedly offered help to the Russian embassy in Washington several months ago, after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In mid-August she was approached by a person claiming to work for the Russian embassy, who was in reality an FBI agent. During the meeting, the indictment says she told the agent that "she was motivated by patriotism toward Russia to provide any assistance she could to Russia, even if it meant being fired or going to jail".She is accused of offering to bring her wife into the plot, and telling the agent that she had access to medical information at the base and insight on how the US was training the military to provide assistance to Ukraine. At another meeting later on the same day, Maj Henry allegedly told the agent that she was also committed to Russia, and considered volunteering to join the Russian army. She apparently said she had reservations about violating the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which is what the couple have been charged with. But Dr Gabrielian allegedly had no such concerns, and handed over some information later in August. The indictment suggests the couple planned to hand over the medical records in order to prove their willingness to help the Russians, and their level of access to secret information. Dr Gabrielian is also accused of telling the agent that her wife could share information about how the US military establishes army hospitals in war conditions, and previous training given by the US to the Ukrainian military.

The incubation period can last from two days to three weeks. Ebola can be associated with other illnesses such as malaria and typhoid.The fact that it was three weeks before the first case was detected on 20 September has caused concern.Ebola spreads between humans by direct contact with bodily fluids and contaminated environments. Funerals can be a particular risk if mourners have direct contact with the body.Most of the 31 cases identified are in Uganda's central district of Mubende, of whom six people have died.However, the death toll may be higher. The health ministry says there were 18 deaths, linked to confirmed cases, where burials took place before they could be tested.The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates the fatality rate is between 41% and 100%.Another concern is that this is the Sudan strain of Ebola, for which there is no approved vaccine, unlike the more common Zaire strain. This means there has been no vaccination of health workers, who account for six of the confirmed cases.The Zaire strain was responsible for the largest ever outbreak of Ebola, in West Africa from December 2013 to 2016. More than 11,000 people died.With more than 28,000 cases in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, scientists carried out intensive research into Ebola vaccines.Two years after that epidemic ended, the then unlicensed Ervebo vaccine, developed by Merck, was used during an outbreak of the Zaire strain in the west of the Democratic Republic of Congo. It was granted clearance by the WHO, which said it had limited infections and saved lives.A second vaccine by Johnson &amp; Johnson has since been approved for use by the European Medicines Agency. But neither of these vaccines has been tested against the Sudan strain.Nonetheless Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni said his government was exploring whether it was worth trying them.The focus is on contact tracing - finding those who have been in close proximity with patients, especially those who attended the community funerals.A 51-bed treatment facility is operational in Mubende district, the epicentre of the outbreak. A second facility is due to be set up soon.President Museveni said two mobile laboratories would be sent to Mubende by Friday, so that people would not have to travel for tests and risk spreading the virus.Medics have expressed concern about the lack of adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves and masks. They have also called for the affected region to be put under quarantine. However, President Museveni ruled out restrictions, saying: "Ebola is not spread like corona[virus]" as it is not an airborne disease.He said markets, schools and places of worship would remain open, but urged people to observe personal hygiene and avoid close contact. Ebola jumps to humans from infected animals, such as chimpanzees, fruit bats and forest antelope. Bushmeat - wild forest animals hunted for human consumption - is thought to be the natural reservoir of the virus.It then spreads between humans by direct contact with contaminated bodily fluids - blood, saliva, vomit, semen, vaginal discharge, urine, faeces and sweat.Men who have recovered from Ebola have also been found to harbour the virus in their semen for a period after recovery. To prevent infection, health professionals advise avoiding contact with cases, including stopping shaking hands, washing hands with soap and water and cleaning surfaces with chlorinated water.It is also important to isolate cases and their contacts. Countries usually set up holding centres for suspected cases and treatment centres for laboratory-confirmed cases.In eastern DR Congo, which borders Uganda, survivors of Ebola played a key role in providing care for infected patients as it has been established that they cannot be re-infected. However, medical teams must wear full PPE when attending to cases to prevent infection. Bodies, in a body bag, must be buried by those wearing proper PPE. More recent innovations have included having body bags with clear covers around the face to enable families to view the body safely before burial. </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Jessica Murphy"><Text> In recent years Canada has worked to advance reconciliation with indigenous people in the country. What does the accession of a new King of Canada mean for that process? Earlier this year, at a reception in Canada's national capital, King Charles - at the time the Prince of Wales - was asked for an apology. The request came from Assembly of First Nations National Chief RoseAnne Archibald, who told him that the Crown needs to make amends for the "assimilation and genocide" of indigenous schoolchildren at residential schools run by the Anglican Church - of which Charles is now the head - and for its role in colonisation. The three-day visit was Charles's nineteenth official tour in the country, and his last as the Prince of Wales.Charles did not apologise on the trip, though he spoke of the need to "come to terms with the darker and more difficult aspects" of history.But some are hopeful that the new King's accession will be the beginning of a more positive relationship between the Crown and indigenous peoples in Canada.Around the world, Commonwealth nations, including Canada, are grappling with what the role of the monarchy following Queen Elizabeth's death, and what her son, Charles, should do to make amends for colonialism.  In Canada, the King's accession comes amid a national conversation about reconciliation with indigenous peoples. It is a conversation that has been building for years, but came to the forefront last summer as First Nations came forward with evidence of the discovery of unmarked graves on the sites of former residential schools - government-funded institutions established in the 1800s that were part of a former policy to assimilate indigenous children.For Canada, reconciliation is multi-faceted. In addition to a royal apology, many have called on the Crown to return indigenous artefacts that were removed and taken to Britain, and to play a more active role in honouring historic treaty relationships between the monarchy and indigenous people.These treaties are constitutionally recognised agreements that define the rights and responsibilities between indigenous groups and federal and provincial governments. Treaties with the Crown date back to the 1700s, and negotiating modern treaties is seen as an important part of reconciliation. Cree writer and former treaty negotiator Darrel J McLeod argued in Canada's Globe and Mail newspaper earlier this month that Queen Elizabeth failed to use the resources available to her to make amends for things done in the Crown's name - from issuing formal apology to the repatriation of indigenous artefacts.He said he hoped the King will "have the insight and determination to accomplish what his mother wasn't able to and use whatever time that might remain for the Windsor dynasty's role in Canada to turn things around". The child graves behind Canada's national reckoningWATCH: Canada 'Sixties Scoop' - Indigenous survivors map out their storiesCanada was a monarchy even before it was a country. Over 500 years ago, both French and British monarchs presided over colonies in Canada. The connection between the Crown and indigenous peoples dates back even further, to when Europeans first set foot on the continent.To this day, symbols of treaties signed in the 1800s with the Crown can be seen on the prairies. When they were signed, 'treaty medals', which acknowledged promises made by the Crown, were handed out. "It had the Queen's image on one side, and that was given to every chief who signed the treaty," noted Doug Cuthand, a Canadian columnist and member of the Little Pine First Nation in the province of Saskatchewan. "And every chief who signs a treaty was given a Union Jack, because Canada didn't have a flag at that time."Although now it is the federal government, and not the Royal Family, that has the power to administer these agreements, the Crown still has a symbolic relationship with indigenous people. Union Jacks are still a common sight at First Nations gatherings across those provinces, signifying the importance of those agreements, said Mr Cuthand. Canada's Governor General Mary Simon is the representative of the Crown in Canada, one of 15 countries where the King continues to operate as head of state. An Inuk woman - and the first indigenous person in the role - she recalled how as a child in the far north, portraits of the Queen hung in many homes."She was revered by communities, Inuit people in the Arctic," she told the BBC's Chief International Correspondent Lyse Doucet earlier this month.But there is anger directed at the monarchy as well. In Manitoba last year, statues of Queen Victoria and Queen Elizabeth were toppled during protests over the unmarked graves at residential school sites. There is a recognition by indigenous people of the damage that colonialism did to the First Nations, said Mr Cuthand, but also of the ties forged long ago."It's a bit of a dichotomy, isn't it?" he said. "There's that sort of high-level relationship that exists, but then there was the implementation of the treaties and of the colonialism that followed."Nathan Tidridge, vice-president of the Institute for the Study of the Crown in Canada, argues that when Canada became a country in 1867, it in many ways eclipsed that original relationship between monarchy and indigenous nations, placing political power and the treaties under the control of federal governments. Entrusted by the Crown to govern, they oversaw damaging policies like residential schooling.Still, many indigenous people in Canada say King Charles has an important role in reconciliation despite being limited to a symbolic role as head of state and expected to not meddle in Canadian political affairs.  "All signs point to an engaged King who is more competent on indigenous issues" than Queen Elizabeth was, said Niigaan Sinclair, professor of indigenous studies at the University of Manitoba. "We need a monarch that's going to intervene when they see injustice taking place," he said - one that's "going to care beyond just nice words.""We need a monarch that's going to have the ear of the prime minister and say 'these are the treaties that you must adhere to because the Crown has signed onto them.'"King Charles recently reiterated to the governor general that he was committed to reconciliation, and Mr Tidridge sees the potential for work to be done through the Crown's representatives like Ms Simon and her counterparts in Canada's provinces. Although he did not apologise on his recent visit, Mr Tidridge thinks that one day the King could come to Canada for the apology requested by Chief Archibald."You don't just come for a whistle-stop tour, and then issue an apology - this takes time," he said."The Crown is this old institution that sweeps up over a millennia of history. He is someone that recognises and understands that history," Mr Tidridge said of the new King."He could do things that I think that his mother couldn't do."</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Juliana Gragnani &amp; Jake Horton"><Text>Before a vote has been cast in Brazil's forthcoming election, current President Jair Bolsonaro is sowing doubts about how secure the country's voting system is. While campaigning, he has said that the voting machines used across Brazil are open to fraud, with echoes of Donald Trump's rhetoric around the 2020 US presidential election."The system is completely vulnerable," claims President Bolsonaro, without providing evidence. Voting is done electronically, as has been the case since 1996.Each candidate has a number, and on election day voters type the number of their chosen candidate into a voting machine at polling stations across the country. The votes are then counted by the machines, and the totals are sent electronically to a central office. Votes from across the country are tallied up and a final result is announced, usually within hours of polls closing. Each machine also prints out a paper copy of the totals for each candidate. When polls close they are displayed publicly at polling sites, and each machine's votes can be compared with the total recorded by the electoral court. This year, for the first time, these paper copies will be published online on the day of the vote.President Bolsonaro has said: "We cannot have dubious elections in 2022. Public counting of votes is needed." He's been making similar claims for years. After winning the 2018 presidential election in a run-off, he claimed voting fraud robbed him of an outright victory in the first round, which he won by a 17 point margin with 46% of the vote.Subsequent studies of the 2018 election didn't find any evidence of voting irregularities. Brazilians vote electronically, so there are no paper copies of individual ballots.This has been highlighted by President Bolsonaro as a security issue, and he has called for "printable and auditable" paper ballots to safeguard the electronic system."It's impossible to audit elections in Brazil," President Bolsonaro declared in July during a meeting with ambassadors.He says it is "easy to rig" electronic voting machines by altering their source code, the internal commands within a machine's software.It's not true to say you can't audit the vote in Brazil. The machines can retrieve votes cast for an electronic recount.Such an audit took place in the 2014 presidential election, which concluded that there was no foul play."There is no reasonable proof of fraud going on in the past, at least in big audits that have been done," says Prof Marcos Simplicio, who took part in the auditing of the 2014 election.The Supreme Electoral Court, the body that oversees Brazil's election, says the system has a series of procedures in place to secure the vote.For example, a number of voting machines are selected at random to be removed from polling sites for a test vote alongside the actual vote on election day.These are checked to be working correctly by entering test votes for each of the candidates in a process witnessed by party representatives. "The vote placed in the electronic ballot box is secured by several mechanisms. The software goes through several tests, including tests with experts and outside investigators who try to break its security," says Julio Valente, the Information Technology Secretary of Brazil's electoral court.Before each election the court invites researchers and software experts to look for vulnerabilities in the voting system. This year, more than 20 experts tried to penetrate the system but failed to do so.However, over the years experts have said improvements could be made."The security of the Brazilian election system relies heavily on the system's software, which has been the main point of criticism from the academic community since the 90s," says Prof Paulo Matias, a computer security specialist at the University of São Carlos. Brazil election: 'We'll vote for Bolsonaro because he is God'Lula: Can Brazil's 'most popular president' win again?Brazil election: Why it matters so much to the USPresident Bolsonaro has also claimed votes are counted in a "secret room" out of public view at the central electoral office. The votes are counted by computers that are located in a secure room but party representatives can monitor the process."The view of most of the technical community is that fraud is really hard in the current system. The system can be improved and should be, but that doesn't mean there's been fraud," says Prof Simplicio.Allegations that the system is unreliable have spread across social media - often in groups backing the president. Just a quarter of Bolsonaro supporters say they trust the electoral system "a lot", and almost a third don't trust it "at all" according to a recent survey.Videos containing misleading information from previous elections are used to cast doubt on the system.  Two videos that were spread following the 2018 election showed voters entering Bolsonaro's number and receiving the message "null vote". However, on the election day, Brazilians don't vote only for the president. They also cast votes for other political representatives, such as senators and governors, and use unique numbers to do so. A closer look at the two videos shows that Bolsonaro's number had been pressed when the voter was asked to choose a  governor. When there is no candidate with that number, a "null vote" message is displayed. Voters can still correct the mistake and press the right number before confirming their vote.Another video allegedly showed a man pressing Bolsonaro's number and the machine showing his rival's picture instead. At the time, the electoral court debunked the video, saying it had been edited. The video didn't show the voting machine buttons and screen at the same time, which meant different images could've been stitched together.Additional reporting by Mariana SanchesRead more from Reality CheckSend us your questions</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Laura Bicker"><Text>Santiago Matela was 22 when he was dragged off the street by soldiers while playing basketball. The year was 1977, five years since President Ferdinand E Marcos had declared martial law in the Philippines -  on 21 September 1972.Mr Marcos suspended parliament and arrested opposition leaders - Mr Matela was among the tens of thousands of people detained and tortured during a decade of martial law.  Fifty years on, he is no longer afraid to speak out. But he is afraid of not being believed at a time when the truth about one of the darkest periods in Filipino history is under attack. Mr Matela endured three months of torture, including being tied naked to a block of ice. His captors demanded he admit to being a communist. He says he didn't even know what that word meant."They kept on forcing me to confess that I was leading a rally and throwing grenades. They asked me the same questions again and again and beat me. They used a yantok - a cane - and they hit my body many times," he said. "Even my genitals were assaulted by the military just to make you confess what you should not be confessing."Some 70,000 people were imprisoned, 34,000 were tortured and over 3,200 people were killed in the nine years after Mr Marcos imposed martial law, according to Amnesty International.Meanwhile, the Marcos family lived famously opulent lifestyles. Mr Marcos' wife, Imelda Marcos, amassed a huge collection of art and other luxuries, including hundreds of pairs of shoes.They deny siphoning off billions of dollars of state wealth while at the helm of what historians consider one of Asia's most notorious kleptocracies. Public anger at abuse and corruption eventually led to pro-democracy protests in 1986 and the family were forced to flee to Hawaii where they lived in exile. Ferdinand Marcos died three years later.But earlier this year, his son and namesake, Ferdinand Marcos Jr - popularly known as "Bongbong" - led an extraordinary comeback and won the presidency in a landslide victory.What a Marcos revival means for the PhilippinesWhy the Marcos family is so infamous'Politicians hire me to spread fake stories'The Marcos rebranding is the result of a major social media operation, aimed at younger Filipinos born after martial law ended. The message seeded in snappy Facebook, YouTube and TikTok posts is that the family has been unfairly treated by the mainstream press.Mr Marcos Jr has shunned network news interviews and refused to participate in presidential debates. He has made it clear he doesn't want to discuss the past and has instead focused on a promise to unite the nation and help it recover from the crippling effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.This popular message, by a recognisable celebrity name, hit home with voters eager for change - including Mr Matela's children. Mr Matela tells me that his son believes the past should stay in the past, a view that he finds upsetting. "My son is adamantly on their side. He doesn't know that what I'm doing is all for them. These are my experiences and what I'm fighting for is for their sake too, so that they will know what happened. "You want me to just disregard what I went through? That cannot happen. The sufferings I went through are embedded in my mind," he said. "I'm still fighting because of my pain."The Marcos administration insists it has not engaged in disinformation. Gemma, a fact checker from the news website Rappler founded by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Maria Ressa, says the disinformation being propagated is difficult to quantify."It's not one single page, it's not one single account, it's not one single group. The point is that it's coming at you from various points. We've mapped tens of thousands of accounts and groups and pages. "Many look like official history pages and post content that triggers nostalgia but within that content you will find stories peddling an incorrect narrative."Among the most widely spread falsehoods are claims that no arrests were made under martial law."Many of the posts deny human rights abuses took place and claim that the only people incarcerated were rebels or criminals or troublemakers," Gemma said. The Marcos administration has not responded to the BBC's requests for an interview. Mr Marcos Jr has posted an interview on YouTube with his goddaughter where he denies that his father was a dictator.The Marcos family has never apologised, but more than 11,000 victims, including Mr Matela, have received reparations from the government.Their written accounts are logged in dozens of numbered cardboard boxes piled high in an archive at the Human Rights Violations Victims' Memorial Commission, an independent government body.In a new green room at the centre, a young team are creating their own snappy social media posts - with facts about martial law."You have to go where the young people are," says executive director Crisanto Carmelo. Fears the past is being rewritten have led to a push to preserve and digitise the detailed accounts of martial law abuse in the hope that they can be placed in a museum. One file recalls how a mother was handed back the body of her brutally tortured and murdered son. The account is too gruesome to detail here.But will Mr Marcos allow such a museum - one built to honour the victims of martial law - while he is president?"I am optimistic that he will be magnanimous in victory and serious in his intention to unify the country," Mr Carmelo said. "This is the year which marks the 50th year of the declaration of martial law which transformed our country and transformed the lives of many ordinary Filipinos. Many of them are now in their senior years, like me, so a museum is not for me, I lived through it. "A museum is for the younger generation - to say that this happened to our country and if we can come together, they can determine what type of country and system of government and rules of liberty and democracy they want for the future."Many young Filipinos are engaged. On a recent popular historical tour, young Filipinos played games to recreate the past.The idea is to help them pin down the facts and navigate away from a maze of martial law myths.The teams took selfies together - most of them had met only a few hours earlier. They planted flowers at the memorial with the names of those who died under martial law.Seventeen-year-old Hannah found the day emotional."They've lost their dreams, their lives and I wanted to recognise that. I want to go and tell my friends that in order for us to have the liberty and democracy we have today, these were people who sacrificed everything. They suffered a lot of violence and immoral wrongdoings, and they deserve to be recognised."It seems that voices from the past, however painful, are helping to keep this country's collective memory alive.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Mark Savage"><Text>When Coolio first heard the demo that became Gangsta's Paradise, he had the same reaction as the rest of us."I was like, 'Damn, I really like this song.'"The Pennsylvania-born, Compton-raised rapper was at his manager's house in 1995 to pick up a cheque, when he noticed producer Doug Rasheed messing around with the song in another room."So I went to Doug said, 'Yo! What's this?'" "He said, 'It's just a song we're working on', "And immediately I said, 'It's mine'. Just like that. "I freestyled the whole first line, then I sat down, I picked up a pen and I started to write." Released in August 1995, and boosted by a memorable video starring Michelle Pfeiffer, the song immediately ruled the airwaves. Those lurching stings, the other-worldly choir, and that soaring hook, combined with Coolio's distinctive, confessional storytelling, made it an instant classic.It was the first "serious" rap song to top the UK and US charts, opening the door for acts like 2Pac and the Notorious B.I.G, who, until that point, had been considered too abrasive for the mainstream. And its appeal has never lessened. The biggest-selling single of 1995 in America, Gangsta's Paradise has now been streamed more than one billion times on both Spotify and YouTube. "I thought it was going to be a hood record," he told The Voice in 2017. "I never thought it would crossover the way that it did - to all ages, races, genres, countries and generations."And yet... Gangsta's Paradise faced several hurdles on its way to the top. Here's how it unfolded...Pfeiffer and Snoop lead tributes to rapper Coolio 'People thought Coolio in Castlederg was a hoax'Coolio was born Artis Leon Ivey, Jr in Pennsylvania, and moved to Compton in South Central LA as a boy. Suffering from chronic asthma, he became a bookworm and excelled at school."I lived in that library, man," he told Rolling Stone, while visiting his old neighbourhood in 1995. "I read every kid's book they had in there. I even read Judy Blume."That changed when he turned 11 and his parents divorced. Seeking a way to fit in, he fell into the gangster lifestyle and adopted a menacing, street-tough persona. A few years later, he was busted for bringing a weapon into school. Before he turned 20, he had served time behind bars for larceny.Later, Coolio studied at Compton Community College and discovered rap. He took his stage name, Coolio Iglesias, from Latin heartthrob from Julio Iglesias, and released a few singles on the local scene, but drug abuse derailed his career.In his 20s he moved to San Jose to live with his father, while working as a firefighter; and later credited Christianity for helping him overcome his addiction to crack.Still enamoured with rap, he made a guest appearance on WC and the Maad Circle's 1991 debut album, Ain't a Damn Thang Changed; then joined a collective called the 40 Thevz before signing a solo deal with Tommy Boy records - the influential label that played home to De La Soul, Naughty By Nature and House Of Pain.His first album, It Takes a Thief, arrived in 1994, and was praised for its combination of funky grooves and socially-conscious lyrics. The musician's message was exemplified by the "hilarious" video for Fantastic Voyage, said Source magazine."As the Lakeside groove carries you along, Coolio piles about six milion people into the trunk of his '64 and takes them to a magical land where race, poverty, gangs and sexual orientation don't matter and everybody was cool."Hip-hop's gatekeepers were not interested in such idealism. Ivey's anti-violence, pro-acceptance stance somehow made him "soft". He earned the unwelcome nickname "Un-Coolio".But then came Gangsta's Paradise.One day, Doug Rasheed pulled out his copy of Stevie Wonder's 1976 double-album Songs In The Key Of Life and cut a sample from Pastime Paradise, a bleak and anxious track that was one of the first songs to replace an orchestra with synthesized strings.Rasheed added a crunching beat and a menacing synth bass, then took the track to singer Larry "LV" Sanders, who laid down a vocal for the chorus."I came in singing 'Pastime Paradise,' but then I changed it up to 'Gangsta's Paradise,'" he told Rolling Stone for an oral history of the song in 2015. "I did my parts, all the vocals and the chorus, and I did the choir. That whole choir that you hear was actually me - I did all the parts from soprano down to tenor to the bass."LV wanted a rapper to appear on the track, and offered it to his friend Prodeje, who declined. Then Coolio overheard it.Mesmerised, he started writing lyrics straight away. The opening lyric, which riffs on Psalm 23, came to him instantly: "As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death/I take a look at my life and realise there's not much left.""I freestyled the whole first line, then I sat down, I picked up a pen and I started to write," he told the YouTube series Hot Ones in 2016."It was divine intervention. I was an instrument and the song was the entity. It wrote itself."Coolio was 30 at the time the song was written, but the narrator is 23 and he doesn't know if he'll live to see 24. He was "raised by the street", immersed a life of crime and retribution. If anyone crosses him, they'll end up "lined in chalk". But the story never glorifies the gangster lifestyle. The narrator prays every night, aware that he's trapped. In the final verse, he accuses the system of letting him down."They say I gotta learn, but nobody's here to teach me / If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?"It's a bleak story. One that could only have been told with the perspective Coolio gained from his teenage years. And the rapper bristled when his song was lumped in with the so-called "gangster rap" scene."I'm trying to get rid of that jacket that's been put on my back - that I'm a gangsta rapper," he said in 1995. "That's not my thing."My thing is to be true to myself and try to educate and entertain kids. When I make references [to the gangster lifestyle], I'm trying to get kids' attention using language they want to hear."Then I can take them to a deeper level. I'm just trying to get a better understanding of myself and a better understanding of other people."Gangsta's Paradise was a stark departure from the feel-good funk of Coolio's first album and, at first, his record label weren't sure what to make of it. "I called my A&amp;R at Tommy Boy Records, and I played it for him. He said, 'It sounds pretty good - I think it would make a good album cut.' Those were his exact words!"Incensed, the star's manager decided to shop the song around to movie studios. It nearly ended up on the soundtrack to the Will Smith film Bad Boys, but was eventually placed in the Disney movie Dangerous Minds - the true story of a former Marine who turns around a troubled inner-city high school by teaching them poetry and Bob Dylan lyrics.A lukewarm retread of Dead Poets Society, it was allegedly testing badly with audiences until Coolio's song started getting played on MTV. The video, like the film, starred Michelle Pfeiffer, who went face-to-face with Coolio as a camera spun around them."She was real nice," Coolio told Kiss FM's Rap show at the time. "She brought her son down to the shoot with her and she was cool. We had no problems."He was less enamoured with the movie itself, though."I hate those kinds of movies where, you know, the great white hope comes into the inner-city neighbourhood and saves the little children - 'Ooh la la, hey Santa Claus!' or whatever, all those kinds of things put it in play," he told Yahoo two years ago. "Those kinds of moments happen very few and far between. It's not that many people that care about each other [in real life]."According to Rolling Stone's oral history, the producers of Dangerous Minds, Coolio was paid $100,000 (£92,000) for Gangsta's Paradise. There was only one problem: Stevie Wonder hadn't cleared the sample."When Stevie heard it, he was like, "No, no way. I'm not letting my song be used in some gangster song,'" the star recalled. Luckily, Coolio's then-wife Josefa Salinas, knew Wonder's brother. "I guess he had been trying to tap that for years," he joked in the Rolling Stone article. "She made a call to him, got a meeting with Stevie and talked him into it. His only stipulation was that I had to take the curse words out."That edit undoubtedly changed Coolio's life. A profane version of Gangsta's Paradise would never have been played on pop radio, or entered heavy rotation on MTV. When it hit number one, it opened up new possibilities for hip-hop... although, to some, it marked the end of an era."America suddenly realised it could sell non-party rap to Brit panty-waists, and that's exactly what it's done ever since," wrote music journalist Garry Mulholland in his book This Is Uncool: The 500 Greatest Singles Since Punk And Disco."In many ways, Gangsta's Paradise signalled the end of gangsta, or 'reality' rap as a cult. It lost the allure of the forbidden when you mum started singing along."Coolio was ambivalent about the song too, often lamenting how its success overshadowed his other work."It's a blessing and a curse at the same time," he said. "For people that really like Gangsta's Paradise, that's all they really want to hear."In recent years, however, the musician came to appreciate the song's legacy, and his role in hip-hop history."People would kill to take my place," he said in 2018. "I'm sure after I'm long gone from this planet, and from this dimension, people will come back and study my body of work."Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

It stressed that payment details and account passwords were not compromised.Those whose passport or licence numbers were taken - roughly 2.8 million people - are at a "quite significant" risk of identity theft and fraud, the government has since said.Optus said it was investigating the breach and had notified police, financial institutions, and government regulators. The breach appears to have originated overseas, local media reported. In an emotional apology, Optus chief executive Kelly Bayer Rosmarin called it a "sophisticated attack", saying the company has very strong cybersecurity."Obviously, I am angry that there are people out there that want to do this to our customers, and I'm disappointed that we couldn't have prevented it," she said on Friday. Early on Saturday, an internet user published data samples on an online forum and demanded a ransom of $1m (A$1.5m; £938,000) in cryptocurrency from Optus.The company had a week to pay or the other stolen data would be sold off in batches, the person said.Investigators are yet to verify the user's claims, but some experts quickly said the sample data - which contained about 100 records - appeared legitimate.Sydney-based tech reporter Jeremy Kirk contacted the purported hacker and said the person gave him a detailed explanation of how they stole the data.The user contradicted Optus's claims the breach was "sophisticated", saying they pulled the data from a freely accessible software interface."No authenticate needed… All open to internet for any one to use," they said in a message, according to Kirk.In another escalation on Tuesday, the person claiming to be the hacker released 10,000 customer records and reiterated the ransom deadline.But just hours later, the user apologised - saying it had been a "mistake" - and deleted the previously posted data sets."Too many eyes. We will not sale [sic] data to anyone," they posted. "Deepest apology to Optus for this. Hope all goes well from this."That sparked speculation about whether Optus had paid the ransom - which the company denies - or whether the user had been spooked by the police investigation.Adding to the problem, others on the forum had copied the now-deleted data sets, and continued to distribute them.It also emerged some customers' Medicare details - government identification numbers that could provide access to medical records - had also been stolen, something Optus did not previously disclose. Late on Wednesday, the company said this had affected almost 37,000 Medicare cards.  Optus has been inundated with messages from angry customers since last week. People have been warned to watch out for signs of identity theft and for opportunistic scammers, who are said to be already cashing in on the confusion. A class-action lawsuit could soon be filed against the company. "This is potentially the most serious privacy breach in Australian history, both in terms of the number of affected people and the nature of the information disclosed," said Ben Zocco from Slater and Gordon Lawyers.The government has called the breach "unprecedented" and blamed Optus, saying it "effectively left the window open" for sensitive data to be stolen.In an ABC television interview on Monday, Cyber Security Minister Clare O'Neil was asked: "You certainly don't seem to be buying the line from Optus that this was a sophisticated attack?""Well, it wasn't. So no," Ms O'Neil replied. The moment drew lots of attention online. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterMs Bayer Rosmarin told News Corp Australia on Tuesday: "We have multiple layers of protection. So it is not the case of having some sort of completely exposed APIs [software interfaces] sitting out there."I think most customers understand that we are not the villains," she said, adding Optus could not say more while the investigation was ongoing.The company has faced calls to cover the costs of replacement passport and driving licences, as people scramble to protect themselves.The breach highlights how much Australia lags behind other parts of the world on privacy and cyber issues, Ms O'Neil says."We are probably a decade behind… where we ought to be," she told the ABC.Australia probes firms over customer 'faceprints' Australia's Nine TV network hit by cyber-attackBoth sides of politics have traded blame on the issue. Opposition MPs have said the Labor government is "asleep at the wheel", but the government points out it was only elected in May after a decade of conservative rule.Ms O'Neil pointed to two areas needing urgent reform.She argues the government should be able to better penalise companies like Optus. In some countries, the company would have faced hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties but Australia's fine is capped at about $2m, she said.She also wants to expand cyber-security laws that were introduced last year to include telecommunications companies."At the time, the telecommunications sector said: "Don't worry about us - we're really good at cybersecurity. We'll do it without being regulated. I would say that this incident really calls that assertion into question."Security experts have also suggested reforming data retention laws so telecommunication companies don't have to keep sensitive information for so long. Ex-customers should also have the right to request companies delete their data, experts say.Optus says it is required to keep identity data for six years under the current rules.Other industry figures have argued consumers should be able to take companies that lose control of their information to court, instead of the industry regulator.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Katy Watson"><Text>In the second of two profiles of the leading candidates in the race to become Brazil's new president, Katy Watson asks if Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is the same person who took the world by storm 20 years ago.It is no coincidence that Lula chose the Amazon as one of his key destinations on the campaign trail. The 76-year-old's main rival in the presidential election on 2 October, far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, has been accused of destroying the rainforest. Lula knows that climate issues have soared to the top of the political agenda and in Manaus, the biggest city in the Amazon, he told reporters "the planet needs special attention from all of us"."We need to look after our forest, our fauna, our water, but most of all, we need to look after our people because they're struggling, they're in need and they need to live with dignity," he said. "We can reclaim this country, it's possible to once again walk with our heads held high."Lula chose the Museum of the Amazon to meet indigenous leaders and talk about the future of the forest. "Nobody wants to turn the Amazon into an untouchable world sanctuary," he told the audience. "What we want is to benefit from our wealth, our biodiversity." By saying that, the former president shows that he is aware of his rival's message. President Bolsonaro is at great pains to say that the rest of the world needs to stop meddling in Brazil's affairs.It is 20 years since Lula won the presidency for the first time. A former metal worker and union leader, he became a familiar face during the strikes of the 1970s, when workers called for higher wages, defying Brazil's military rulers.He came to power promising change. Helped by high commodity prices, he spent the windfalls on areas such as higher education and welfare programmes that contributed to lifting millions of Brazilians out of poverty. Described by former US President Barack Obama as "the most popular politician on Earth", Lula left office after eight years in power with an approval rating of more than 80%.Like him or hate him, he was a politician unlike any other. But in recent years, that legacy has been tainted with his party - and Lula himself - hit by corruption scandals. In 2017, he was sentenced to nine years in prison. His convictions were quashed four years later, but his brush with the law means that he is no longer just seen as the "saviour" of Brazil. Instead, many millions of Brazilians see him as a corrupt politician unfit for office.Given that split among voters, I asked him how he thought he could convince the electorate he is the right man to lead Brazil. "Deaths [like that] of Dom Phillips and Bruno Pereira can't ever happen again," he said, skirting the question with a reference to the killing in June of a British journalist and an indigenous expert in the Amazon."Brazil needs to be transformed into a civilised country, it can't fall victim to inhumane people," he added. "I am convinced that we need to change Brazil - and changing Brazil means having a government that assumes responsibility for really caring for people."Not far from the centre of Manaus, where Lula spoke, 24-year-old mother-of-three Carol Araújo lives in small community of palafitas - houses that sit on stilts over a small river.Rainy season is coming to an end and the earth below the houses here in the neighbourhood of São Jorge resembles a swamp more than a river.Rubbish is everywhere: broken bottles, old boxes and shoes. In the sweltering heat of Manaus, the stench is overpowering.  Official figures suggest an estimated 63 million people now live in poverty in Brazil, and Carol, who was born in São Jorge, is one of them. She knows nothing but hardship, but she does know who she is going to cast her ballot for. "I'm going to vote for Lula because under him, everything was easier," she says. "But I don't know if [by him] coming back things will improve." It is a risk she is prepared to take. With food and energy prices rising, she cannot make ends meet."I try and find work when it comes my way but it's hard. I have to make it work to feed my children." She says that it comes down to knowing who will help her and those like her, because "during the elections, all the politicians do is make promises".Lula more easily relies on the older generation, which can remember the good times, but he knows he will have to win over the younger generation voting for the first time. "It's a sign of the incapacity of Brazil's elite to renew itself," says Oliver Stuenkel, professor of international relations at the Getúlio Vargas Foundation in São Paulo. "Lula has been running for president since Brazil became a democracy in the late 1980s, and in that sense he is very much a key personality of Brazil's transition from autocracy to democracy. But he struggles to point to the future, he's very much a throwback."But while this is the same Lula, he will not be in charge of the same Brazil. Economic crises and more political polarisation set the country apart from what he inherited the first time.For supporter Beth Ferreira, that does not matter. "I am crazy about Lula - Brazil needs him because we are in decline," she says. "When he started in 2003, Brazil was in the same situation, it was devastated. And we think he can do the same thing - our hope never dies."</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By David Gritten"><Text>Iran's supreme leader has blamed the US and Israel for the anti-government protests sweeping the country, in his first public comments on the unrest.Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said "riots" had been "engineered" by Iran's arch-enemies and their allies, and alleged that Qurans had been burned.He also called on security forces to be ready to deal with further unrest.The protests - the biggest challenge to his rule for a decade - were sparked by the death in custody of a woman.Mahsa Amini, 22, fell into a coma hours after being detained by morality police on 13 September in Tehran for allegedly breaking the strict law requiring women to cover their hair with a hijab, or headscarf. She died three days later.Her family has alleged that officers beat her head with a baton and banged her head against one of their vehicles. The police have said there is no evidence of any mistreatment and that she suffered "sudden heart failure".Women have led the protests that began after Ms Amini's funeral, waving their headscarves in the air or setting them on fire to chants of "Woman, life, freedom" and "Death to the dictator" - a reference to Ayatollah Khamenei.The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterAddressing a graduation ceremony of police and armed forces cadets on Monday, the supreme leader said Ms Amini's death "broke our hearts"."But what is not normal is that some people, without proof or an investigation, have made the streets dangerous, burned the Quran, removed hijabs from veiled women and set fire to mosques and cars," he added, without mentioning any specific incidents. The ayatollah, who has the final say on all state matters, asserted that foreign powers had planned "rioting" because they could not tolerate Iran "attaining strength in all spheres"."I say clearly that these riots and the insecurity were engineered by America and the occupying, false Zionist regime [Israel], as well as their paid agents, with the help of some traitorous Iranians abroad."He also gave his full backing to the security forces, saying that they had faced "injustice" during the unrest.Iran Human Rights, a Norway-based group, said on Sunday that at least 133 people had been killed by security forces so far. They include 41 protesters whom ethnic Baluch activists said had died in clashes in Zahedan on Friday.State media have reported that more than 40 people have been killed, including security personnel.Ayatollah Khamenei's comments came a day after security forces violently cracked down on a protest by students at Iran's most prestigious science and engineering university, reportedly arresting dozens.The BBC's Kasra Naji says the gunfire heard around the campus of Sharif University of Technology in Tehran on Sunday night spread fear among many Iranians that authorities had decided to make an example of the students.Security forces tried to the enter the campus, but the students drove them back and closed all the entrance gates.But, our correspondent adds, a siege developed and the students who tried to leave through an adjacent car park were picked up one by one and beaten, blindfolded and taken away.In one video posted on social media, a large number of people are seen running inside a car park while being pursued by men on motorbikes. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterThe siege was lifted later in the night following the intervention of professors and a government minister. On Monday, students at the university announced that they would not go back to classes until all of their fellow students had been released from detention. The university meanwhile said it had moved classes online, citing "the need to protect students".Protests were also reported at several other universities around the country. </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Valdya Baraputri and Raja Lumbanrau in Malang, Matt Murphy in London"><Text>Football fans "died in the arms" of players during a crush at Indonesia's Kanjuruhan stadium, the home team coach has said, as the number of children killed in the tragedy rose to 32.Javier Roca said the crush at the match in Java, in which 125 people lost their lives, left him "mentally shattered". Authorities say the youngest victim of Saturday's disaster was just three. Some 18 officers are being investigated after police fired tear gas at fans who invaded the pitch when the match ended.More than 320 other people were injured as supporters were trampled on and suffocated in crushes as they fled the gas. Indonesia's deputy minister of children and women affairs said the children were aged between three and 17. An eyewitness told the BBC that police had fired numerous gas rounds "continuously and fast" after the situation with fans became "tense". Home team Arema FC supporters ran onto the pitch when the match ended in a 3-2 defeat to their rivals Persebaya Surabaya.Videos on social media show fans clambering over fences to escape. Separate videos appeared to show lifeless bodies on the floor.One witness, Chandra, told the BBC that a sea of smoke in the stands caused instant panic among spectators. "Little kids were crying, women were fainting, screams were heard everywhere, all were flocking out," he said. Another fan, Eko, said he couldn't get out of the stand's exits due to the number of people trying to escape. "I went back to the top of the stands with friends. Then I used a scarf to keep the smoke away. After that I jumped into the field and went down through the side door," he said.Ester Andayanengtyas told the BBC her 17-year-old daughter Debora suffered serious injuries, including a broken neck and swelling on the brain during the panic. "I asked her not to watch the game that day. She didn't return home, in the morning her friends were looking for her," Ms Andayanengtyas said. "We looked for her in the ER, but she wasn't there. The hospital told us to look at the mortuary. The confusion happened because my daughter didn't carry an ID." Other witnesses reported hearing parents crying out "where is my child" among the chaos, and one man told the BBC that he saw parents collapsing while protecting their children. "A mother fainted while hugging her child, next to her the boy fainted," he said. "Then some supporters picked up the mother and the boy to get out of the stadium. They were carried away unconscious - maybe because of the tear gas."Muhamad Dipo Maulana, 21, who was at the match, told BBC Indonesian that after the game had ended a few Arema fans went on the pitch to remonstrate with the home team players but were immediately intercepted by police and "beaten".More spectators then took to the pitch in protest, the supporter said."Police with dogs, shields, and soldiers came forward," Mr Dipo told the BBC. He said he had heard more than 20 tear gas shots towards spectators at the stadium.Police spokesperson Dedi Prasetyo told reporters that the officers under investigation "were responsible for holding" the weapons and said they were being questioned by an internal affairs team. A police chief has now been sacked following the investigation.He added that several other officers, including the field security team, and some officials from the Indonesian football league, were also under investigation. Indonesia's human rights commission said it will conduct its own inquiry into the disaster, and President Joko Widodo has ordered that all matches in Indonesia's top league must be stopped until the official probe has been carried out. Amnesty International said the police response amounted to "use of excessive force by the state" to control an unarmed crowd, and protesters in the capital Jakarta on Sunday night carried placards that read "stop police brutality". Indonesia's police force has been previously criticised for its frequent use of tear gas in tightly-packed stadiums.Meanwhile, Mr Roca, the Arema FC coach, told the Spanish broadcaster Cadena Ser that he thought "the police overstepped their mark" in efforts to control the crowd. The announcement of the investigation comes after world football's governing body Fifa called the disaster "a dark day for all involved in football and a tragedy beyond comprehension". Fifa's own regulations say no "crowd control gas" should be carried or used by stewards or police at matches and the body has requested a report on the incident from the Indonesian football federation. Security Minister Mahfud MD wrote on Instagram that the stadium had been filled beyond capacity, with over 42,000 tickets being sold for the game in the 38,000 capacity stadium. "It had gotten anarchic. They started attacking officers, they damaged cars," said Nico Afinta, police chief in East Java, adding that two police officers were among the dead."We would like to convey that... not all of them were anarchic. Only about 3,000 who entered the pitch," he said.Fleeing fans "went out to one point at the exit. Then there was a build-up, in the process of accumulation there was shortness of breath, lack of oxygen", the officer added.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Vanessa Buschschlüter"><Text>Brazil's election is going into a second round in which left-winger Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva will face far-right incumbent Jair Bolsonaro.With almost all the votes counted, Lula had won 48% against Bolsonaro's 43% - a much closer result than opinion polls had suggested.But Lula fell short of the more than 50% of valid votes needed to prevent a run-off. Voters now have four weeks to decide which of the two should lead Brazil.Winning outright in the first round was always going to be a tall order for any candidate - the last time it happened was 24 years ago.But President Bolsonaro and Lula had given their supporters hope that they could achieve just that.Both candidates can and will claim this as a victory, though. Lula has already said that this is a "mere delay" on his way to the presidency.For the 76-year-old former metal worker - who could not run in the 2018 election because he was in prison after being convicted on corruption charges which were later annulled - this spells a remarkable comeback.And President Bolsonaro, whom opinion polls had shown trailing far behind Lula, will rejoice in the fact that he proved the pollsters wrong, just as he had predicted he would. A race that is far from overWhy Brazil's election matters so much to the US'Our candidate isn't perfect, but he beats the alternative'This is a drama which has been years in the making. The two men are arch-rivals and spent much of the campaign trading insults.In the last TV debate before the vote, President Bolsonaro called Lula a thief, in reference to the corruption charges that put him in jail for 580 days before the conviction was annulled. Lula, who has always maintained that the charges against him were politically motivated, has labelled Mr Bolsonaro a madman.Not surprisingly, that tension has filtered down into the streets. During the nights before the vote, neighbours here in Rio could be heard shouting "Lula is a thief" and "Out with Bolsonaro" at each other.  Since the two candidates are such polar opposites, much is at stake.Lula says he will bolster measures to protect the Amazon rainforest, while Mr Bolsonaro has argued that parts of the rainforest should be opened up to economic exploitation.Deforestation and forest fires have soared during President Bolsonaro's time in office. Climate activists have warned that if he is re-elected, the area could reach a tipping point. Critics point out that Lula's environmental record during his time in office - he governed Brazil from 2003 to 2010 - was far from perfect.  But with Mr Bolsonaro counting on the agricultural sector and agribusiness for votes and support, it is Lula who is the preferred choice of climate activists. However, voters in Brazil have many other pressing concerns, such as rising food prices, which have contributed to an increase in poverty and hunger.Mr Bolsonaro acknowledged these concerns in a statement after the results were out. "I understand that a lot of the vote was down to the situation the Brazilian people are in. They are feeling the price rises, especially those of basic goods. I do understand that there's a desire for change but some change can be for the worse," he warned. Many voters also mentioned education and Brazil's high levels of inequality as issues they want the new president to tackle. Much of the campaign, however, was overshadowed by concern that Mr Bolsonaro may not accept defeat after he had said that "only God" could remove him from office. He had also cast doubts on Brazil's electronic voting system, alleging - without providing any evidence - that it was open to fraud. With the result much more favourable to him than predicted, he is now likely to concentrate more on how to sway those voters who cast their ballot for one of the other nine candidates who were eliminated in the first round.All eyes will now be on centrist Senator Simone Tebet, who came third in the election with 4%, and centre-left candidate Ciro Gomes, who came fourth with 3%. Both said that they would announce "in the coming days" who they would throw their weight behind for the run-off. Lula, who seems to thrive on overcoming obstacles, has already announced that "the fight continues until the final victory, that's our motto".</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Ben Tobias"><Text>Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov says his three sons, aged 14, 15 and 16, will soon travel to the Ukraine front line to fight with Russian forces. Kadyrov is a strong ally of Vladimir Putin, although has recently criticised Russian military leadership.On social media, he wrote that a father should teach his sons how to protect their family, people and fatherland. Russia has signed a UN treaty aimed at preventing children under the age of 18 from taking direct part in hostilities.Using children under the age of 15 to participate in hostilities is considered a war crime by the International Criminal Court. However Russia does not recognise its jurisdiction.In a long post on the Telegram messaging app, Kadyrov said his sons' military training began when they were much younger, and the time had come for them to experience a real battle. He also took aim at those "empty-worded" people who claimed the Chechen leader's loved-ones were not taking part in the military operation in Ukraine. The post was accompanied by a slickly-produced video of his sons firing various weapons at a training ground. Kadyrov has ruled the southern Russian republic since 2007, when he was named the region's president by Vladimir Putin. It has been a period of relative stability in Chechnya, which fought unsuccessfully for independence for a decade. But Kadyrov has been criticised for ruling with an iron fist, and allowing human rights violations to flourish. Kadyrov is a fierce supporter of Vladimir Putin, and Chechen forces have been fighting in Ukraine since the start of the war. However, after recent military setbacks in the Kharkiv and Donetsk regions, he criticised Russia's military leadership, describing one commander as a "mediocrity" and bemoaning a lack of basic logistics.He also called for Russia to take more drastic measures against Ukraine, including the use of a tactical nuclear weapon. The Kremlin responded that decisions like that should not be made emotionally.Kadyrov's criticism was in response to the retreat of Russian forces from the Ukrainian town of Lyman in Donetsk region - a major strategic setback for Moscow.Capturing the town is important for Ukrainian forces, because it can be used as a foothold to reach further into Russian-held parts of Ukraine. It was also being used by Russia as a logistics hub.The defeat in Lyman was also symbolic, as it happened just a day after a grand signing ceremony to annex four occupied regions of Ukraine - including Donetsk, where Lyman is situated. Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions all held so-called referendums on joining Russia last month, which were dismissed as a "sham" by Ukraine and its Western allies. On Sunday evening, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukrainian troops had also recaptured some territory in the Kherson region. Its Russian-installed head, Vladimir Saldo, described the situation there as "tense" and admitted Ukrainian forces had made breakthroughs. None of the four regions newly claimed by Russia are completely under Russian control, raising the question of how annexation will work - particularly in Ukrainian-controlled territory. The Kremlin says it will "consult" with residents of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions over where the borders should lie, suggesting that Russia may decide not to lay claim to the entire regions. In Luhansk and Donetsk the situation is different. Just before the war began Mr Putin recognised the whole of those regions as independent republics, which have now - as Moscow sees it - voted to join Russia. </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="BBC News, author unspecified"><Text>Kim Kardashian has agreed to pay a $1.26m (£1.12m) fine for advertising EthereumMax on her Instagram page.The US Securities and Exchange Commission said the reality TV star had received $250,000 for advertising the cryptocurrency, without disclosing she had been paid to do so.She also agreed not to promote crypto asset securities for three years.Her lawyer told BBC News: "Ms Kardashian is pleased to have resolved this matter with the SEC."The lawyer said: "Kardashian fully cooperated with the SEC from the very beginning and she remains willing to do whatever she can to assist the SEC in this matter. "She wanted to get this matter behind her to avoid a protracted dispute. "The agreement she reached with the SEC allows her to do that so that she can move forward with her many different business pursuits."Ms Kardashian, boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr, basketball player Paul Pierce and EthereumMax's creators were sued by investors in January.The legal action alleged they had collaborated to "misleadingly promote and sell" the cryptocurrency in a "pump and dump" scheme designed to inflate the price before selling to investors.EthereumMax disputed the allegations at the time.In spite of its name, EthereumMax has no legal or business connection with the Ethereum cryptocurrency.Anyone can create a crypto coin.All you need is a few pounds, a YouTube tutorial and a funky name.This month alone, dozens of new tokens will be launched, with creators promising their coin will be the next big thing.With little intrinsic value to the product, marketing is key - and as in many modern industries, celebrities can be the make or break. EthereumMax put a huge amount of money into snapping up celebrities such as Kim Kardashian - and at first, it seemed to be working out. But as with many crypto coins, the fall was as dramatic as the rise. Even if EthereumMax had retained the value it gained after the celebrity pump, regulators both in the US and UK were extremely uncomfortable about the marketing of the coin.The crypto industry is still largely unregulated - but Kim Kardashian joins a growing list of people and companies being punished for promoting these highly risky products.Gary Gensler, who chairs the SEC, called the case a "reminder" celebrity endorsement did not necessarily make a product worth investing in."Ms Kardashian's case also serves as a reminder to celebrities and others that the law requires them to disclose to the public when and how much they are paid to promote investing in securities," he said.Later, in a YouTube video about crypto investment, he added: "Celebrity endorsements... don't mean that an investment product is right for you or even, frankly, that it's legitimate."Even if a celebrity endorsement is genuine, each investment has its own risk and opportunities."When it comes to crypto, remember many of these are highly speculative assets. "You may be wondering if it's right for you or even if it might be a scam."</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By James Gallagher"><Text>The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine has gone to Sweden's Svante Paabo for his work on human evolution. The Prize committee said he achieved the seemingly impossible task of cracking the genetic code of one of our extinct relatives - Neanderthals.He also performed the "sensational" feat of discovering the previously unknown relative - Denisovans.His work helped explore our own evolutionary history and how humans spread around the planet. The Swedish geneticist's work gets to the heart of some of the most fundamental questions - where do we come from and what allowed us, Homo sapiens, to succeed while our relatives went extinct.He was just off to pick his daughter up from a sleepover when he got the call saying he'd won. He told the BBC: "I was very surprised and overwhelmed, I had not expected this." The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterIn the 1990s, research on working out the human genetic code was taking place at pace. But that relied on fresh samples of pristine DNA.Prof Paabo's interest was in the old, degraded and contaminated genetic material from our ancestors. Many thought it was an impossible challenge. But he was, for the first time, able to sequence DNA from a 40,000-year-old piece of bone.Those results showed that Neanderthals - who mostly lived in Europe and Western Asia - were distinct from both modern day humans and chimpanzees.His work focused on hominins - the group of modern humans that includes us, Homo sapiens, but also our extinct relatives. "By revealing genetic differences that distinguish all living humans from extinct hominins, his discoveries provide the basis for exploring what makes us uniquely human", the Nobel committee said.BBC Podcast: Svante Paabo on the difference between us and NeanderthalsFurther comparisons between Neanderthal DNA and humans from around the world showed their DNA was a closer match to humans coming from Europe or Asia. This tells us that Homo sapiens had sex and children with Neanderthals after migrating out of Africa around 70,000 years ago. And you can still see the legacy of that today. Between 1-4% of modern human DNA comes from our Neanderthal relatives and this even affects our body's ability to respond to infection.The next seismic contribution to human origins came in 2008. Scientists had found a 40,000-year-old finger bone in the Denisova cave, in Siberia.Prof Paabo was able to sequence a sample of DNA and the results showed it was a previously unknown hominin - known as Denisovans. And it turned out Homo sapiens bred with Denisovans too. In parts of South East Asia up to 6% of people's DNA is Denisovan. Some of this genetic inheritance helps the body cope with low levels of oxygen, aids survival at high altitudes and is found in present-day Tibetans. Prof Paabo only heard the news this morning when he was called by Thomas Perlmann, the secretary for the Nobel Committee for Physiology or Medicine."He was overwhelmed, he was speechless. Very happy," said Prof Perlmann.Prof Paabo is seen as one of the founders of the scientific discipline of paleogenomics. He wins the 10m Swedish kronor (£800,000) prize. He follows in the footsteps of his father, Sune Bergstrom, who won the same Nobel Prize in 1982.His work shows there were already two distinct groups of hominins (Neanderthals and Denisovans) living in Eurasia when Homo sapiens spread from Africa.Analysis suggests these now extinct populations were small and relatively inbred and may not have been able to compete with rapidly expanding modern humans.Follow James on Twitter2021 - David Julius and Ardem Patapoutian for their work on how the body senses touch and temperature. 2020 - Michael Houghton, Harvey Alter and Charles Rice for the discovery of the virus Hepatitis C.2019 - Sir Peter Ratcliffe, William Kaelin and Gregg Semenza for discovering how cells sense and adapt to oxygen levels2018 - James P Allison and Tasuku Honjo for discovering how to fight cancer using the body's immune system2017- Jeffrey Hall, Michael Rosbash and Michael Young for unravelling how bodies keep a circadian rhythm or body clock2016 - Yoshinori Ohsumi for discovering how cells remain healthy by recycling waste2015 - William C Campbell, Satoshi Ōmura and Youyou Tu for anti-parasite drug discoveries</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Jasmine Andersson"><Text>King Charles will host the first state visit of his reign next month when he welcomes the president of South Africa to Buckingham Palace.President Cyril Ramaphosa and his wife, First Lady Tshepo Motsepe, have accepted an invitation to visit the King and Queen Consort.The visit will take place from Tuesday November 22 to Thursday November 24.It is understood the trip was in the early stages of being planned before the Queen's death in September.It will be the first time a South African leader has visited the UK in an official capacity in more than a decade, with the last state visit being in 2010 when Jacob Zuma visited the late Queen.The King has visited South Africa on a number of occasions since his first tour of the country in 1997, which included stops in Pretoria, Johannesburg, Durban and Cape Town.He last travelled to the country in 2011, with the Queen Consort. It was not a state event.The Queen shared a particularly close relationship with Nelson Mandela, the first democratically elected president of South Africa.

State visits are an exercise in soft power and red carpets, filled with royal ceremony and banquets, but focused on the hard-headed business of strengthening international relationships.It's the Foreign Office that advises on which countries are invited - the last being US President Donald Trump in 2019, before Covid stopped any further state visits.It's pomp with a purpose against a backdrop of pageantry, photo ops and the jangle of a royal carriage ride.

The company says it only uses sawdust and waste wood.Panorama analysed satellite images, traced logging licences and used drone filming to prove its findings. Reporter Joe Crowley also followed a truck from a Drax mill to verify it was picking up whole logs from an area of precious forest. Ecologist Michelle Connolly told Panorama the company was destroying forests that had taken thousands of years to develop."It's really a shame that British taxpayers are funding this destruction with their money. Logging natural forests and converting them into pellets to be burned for electricity, that is absolutely insane," she said.The row over the UK's largest power plantThe Drax power station in Yorkshire is a converted coal plant, which now produces 12% of the UK's renewable electricity.It has already received £6bn in green energy subsidies. Burning wood is considered green, but it is controversial among environmentalists. Panorama discovered Drax bought logging licences to cut down two areas of environmentally-important forest in British Columbia.One of the Drax forests is a square mile, including large areas that have been identified as rare, old-growth forest.The provincial government of British Columbia says old-growth forests are particularly important and that companies should put off logging them.Drax's own responsible sourcing policy says it "will avoid damage or disturbance" to primary and old-growth forest.  However, the latest satellite pictures show Drax is now cutting down the forest. The company told Panorama many of the trees there had died, and that logging would reduce the risk of wildfires. The entire area covered by the second Drax logging licence has already been cut down.  Burning wood produces more greenhouse gases than burning coal. The electricity is classed as renewable because new trees are planted to replace the old ones and these new trees should recapture the carbon emitted by burning wood pellets. But recapturing the carbon takes decades and the off-setting can only work if the pellets are made with wood from sustainable sources. Primary forests, which have never been logged before and store vast quantities of carbon, are not considered a sustainable source. It is highly unlikely that replanted trees will ever hold as much carbon as the old forest. Drax told the BBC it had not cut down the forests itself and said it transferred the logging licences to other companies. But Panorama checked and the authorities in British Columbia confirmed that Drax still holds the licences.Drax said it did not use the logs from the two sites Panorama identified. It said they were sent to timber mills - to make wood products - and that Drax only used the leftover sawdust for its pellets.The company says it does use some logs - in general - to make wood pellets. It claims it only uses ones that are small, twisted, or rotten.But documents on a Canadian forestry database show that only 11% of the logs delivered to the two Drax plants in the past year were classified as the lowest quality, which cannot be used for wood products. Panorama wanted to see if logs from primary forests cut down by logging companies were being transferred to Drax's Meadowbank pellet plant. The programme filmed a truck on a 120-mile round trip: leaving the plant, collecting piles of whole logs from a forest that had been cut down by a logging company and then returning to the plant for their delivery.Drax later admitted that it did use logs from the forest to make wood pellets. The company said they were species the timber industry did not want, and they would often be burned anyway to reduce wildfire risks. The company also said the sites identified by Panorama were not primary forest because they were near roads. But the UN definitions of primary forest do not mention proximity to roads and one of the sites is six miles from the nearest paved road.Panorama's findings come at a critical moment for Drax.The UK government is due to publish a new biomass strategy later this year, which will set out its policy for natural fuels like wood.A Drax spokesperson said 80% of material in its Canadian pellets is sawmill residuals, which would be disposed of anyway. They also said that Drax applies stringent sustainability standards to its own pellet production as well as suppliers, with verification from third-party certification schemes. "We are constantly reviewing these policies to ensure we take account of the latest science," they added.Panorama's The Green Energy Scandal Exposed is on BBC One at 20:00 on Monday 3rd October and on iPlayer afterwards</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Paul Glynn"><Text>Sacheen Littlefeather, the Native American activist who declined Marlon Brando's Oscar for The Godfather on his behalf in 1973, has died aged 75.The actress, who had breast cancer, died on Sunday, the Academy announced.Her death comes two weeks after the organisation honoured her at a ceremony in Los Angeles, publicly apologising for her treatment at the Oscars.Littlefeather, of Apache and Yaqui heritage, was booed while speaking on stage at the event 50 years ago.Dressed in full Apache attire during the first Oscars to be televised around the world, the Californian, born Maria Cruz, explained on Brando's behalf that he would not accept his best actor gong for the mafia movie in order to protest against the treatment of Native Americans by the film industry and to bring attention to the Wounded Knee protests.To whom does Wounded Knee belong? In 1973, several hundred locals, together with radical activists from the American Indian Movement (AIM), poured into the nearby village of Wounded Knee in South Dakota to protest government abuse.The protest resulted in a violent stand-off with federal agents that went on for 71 days."I went up there, like a proud Indian woman with dignity, with courage, with grace, and with humility," she remembered at the recent event."I knew that I had to speak the truth. Some people may accept it. And some people may not."Screen Actors Guild member Littlefeather struggled to get work in the industry afterwards but said it was "never too late for an apology... it's never too late for forgiveness."In a recent interview with Variety, she said she had made the Oscars speech in order to honour her ancestors and "native people everywhere"."I was met with the stereotypical tomahawk chop, individuals who called at me, and I ignored all of them," she recalled. "I continued to walk straight ahead with a couple of armed guards beside me, and I held my head high and was proud to be the first Indigenous woman in the history of the Academy Awards to make that political statement. "At that time in 1973, there was a media blackout on Wounded Knee and against the American Indian Movement that was occupying it," she went on. "Marlon had called them in advance and asked them to watch the Academy Awards, which they did."As they saw me, up on stage, refusing that Academy Award for the stereotypes within the film industry, and mentioning Wounded Knee in South Dakota, it would break the media boycott."In 2020, Littlefeather told the BBC that straight after the speech she had to leave the stage with two security guards. But, she added, it "was a very good thing" as actor John Wayne was backstage. She said he was "furious with Marlon and furious with me" and wanted to pull her off stage himself.Littlefeather featured in films like The Trial of Billy Jack, Johnny Firecloud and Counselor at Crime, but said she returned to San Francisco after being blacklisted by the industry, to continue her activism and work in health care and the theatre.Paying tribute online on Monday, Dakota/Lakota Sioux writer and biologist Ruth H. Robertson, aka Red Road Woman, pointed to Littlefeather's work with the American Indian Aids Institute of San Francisco.Lakota Man on Twitter offered: "It's with a heavy heart that I mourn the passing of Sacheen Littlefeather. I wish her a blessed journey", later adding: "Honour her".TV writer Joey Clift said: "When I talk about how our current Native storytelling movement in Hollywood is built on the shoulders of activists fighting tirelessly for decades for Native people to finally get our day in the sun, I'm talking about Sacheen Littlefeather. RIP."The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterIn announcing her death online, the Academy quoted Littlefeather, the subject of the 2021 documentary, Sacheen: Breaking the Silence, saying: "When I am gone, always be reminded that whenever you stand for your truth, you will be keeping my voice and the voices of our nations and our people alive."</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Natasha Booty"><Text>Burkina Faso's new military leader, Capt Ibrahim Traoré, has urged cabinet ministers to "move faster" to fix the country's "urgent" problems, including an insurgency by Islamist militants.The man he ousted in a coup on Friday has formally agreed to step down, religious and community leaders said.They said Capt Traoré had accepted Lt Col Paul-Henri Damiba's resignation and conditions he had set.He has gone to Togo, according to that country's government spokesman.In a recording widely shared on social media, Lt Col Damiba said he wished Burkina Faso's new leader every success. It is not known if he was alone when it was made.On Sunday Capt Traoré said the country was facing an emergency in every sector, "from security to defence, to health, to social action, to infrastructure", and it was time for government to "abandon the unnecessary red tape".He wants fast solutions to big problems, which some fear signals a turn towards Russia.Latest updates on Burkina Faso from BBC Africa LiveWhy France faces so much anger in West AfricaCoups that promised and failed to bring safetyRussia and France are engaged in a battle for influence in several former French colonies in West and Central Africa. At the weekend there were attacks on French institutions, after it was reported that Lt Col Damiba was sheltering at a French military base in the capital, Ouagadougou.France's foreign ministry said they were the work of "hostile demonstrators" who had been "manipulated by a disinformation campaign against us".Some in Ouagadougou chanted pro-Russian slogans and waved Russian flags as they greeted the new junta leader and his convoy on Sunday. He regards former colonial power France as an ally of the man he ousted, and has spoken of his willingness to work with new partners to fight Islamist insurgents - and analysts believe that could mean hiring Russian mercenaries.Russian military contractors are said to be active in neighbouring Mali, after French forces pulled out following a row with that country's military leaders. The Russians are accused by rights groups of committing abuses and massacres of civilians, which Russia has always denied.The head of the Russian mercenary Wagner group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has welcomed the takeover in Burkina Faso. Meanwhile, the Russian government said on Monday it "would like the situation in Burkina Faso to normalise as soon possible".Burkina Faso controls as little as 60% of its territory, experts say, and Islamist violence is worsening.The African Union has demanded the return of constitutional order by July 2023 at the latest, agreeing with the regional group Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) that the ousting of leader Lt Col Damiba was "unconstitutional".But Ecowas has since praised "the various parties in Burkina Faso for agreeing to a peaceful settlement of their differences", as days of power struggles came to an end without bloodshed.Lt Col Damiba formally resigned on Sunday in exchange for the new junta agreeing to respect seven conditions  - including a guarantee of his personal and family security, an agreement to continue with efforts at national reconciliation and a continued respect for the guarantee of returning to civilian rule within two years. The deposed colonel had himself ousted President Roch Kaboré in January, saying that he had failed to deal with growing militant Islamist violence.Many citizens in Burkina Faso have not felt safe for some time.The Islamist insurgency broke out in the country in 2015, leaving thousands dead and forcing an estimated two million people from their homes.This is Burkina Faso's ninth coup since independence from France in 1960.Additional reporting by Alys Davies</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Matt Murphy"><Text>Bulgaria's centre-right GERB party has won the country's parliamentary election, preliminary results show.Led by ex-Prime Minister Boyko Borissov, GERB took 25.4% of votes with 99% of ballots counted, officials said. But the 63-year-old faces a difficult task forming a working coalition, as most other parties have already ruled out working with him. Many of his opponents accuse him of overseeing government corruption during his time in office, which he denies.Mr Borissov has previously served three separate terms in Bulgaria's top job, and tackling graft became a key part of an election last November. Sunday's poll was called after the centrist government led by Kiril Petkov lost a no-confidence vote in June amid soaring inflation. The 42-year-old Harvard educated economist ran on an anti-corruption ticket and had urged voters to let him "continue the change" ahead of the vote. But he conceded defeat on Sunday evening after his We Continue to Change party took just 20.4% of the vote. Mr Petkov told reporters that "GERB has the responsibility to form a coalition and govern the country". He has already ruled out working with Mr Borissov, pledging to be an "opposition scrutinising the spending of every lev". Pundits say Bulgaria now faces an uncertain political outlook. "The situation is the same as after the last election but even more complicated," Daniel Smilov from the Centre for Liberal Strategies, told the BTV network. "Coalitions that were possible then are no longer possible now." Mr Borissov says he is willing to work with any party to form a working government, but is likely to have to rely on two pro-Russian parties and the Turkish minority MRF grouping. "What's important for us is for reason to prevail," he said on Sunday. "Believe me, right now I am the most well-meaning and open person to all parties."Whoever leads Bulgaria's next government, the EU's poorest nation faces a host of challenges. Inflation has continued to soar - hitting 15% in August - as energy prices spiral amid a dispute with the Russian state-owned gas giant Gazprom. And ministers will also face a difficult challenge managing the country's relationship with Moscow, after Mr Petkov's government turned its back on Vladimir Putin's regime in April. Bulgaria is an EU and Nato member, and Mr Borissov recently called President Putin the "clear aggressor" in Russia's war with Ukraine. Final results from Sunday's election are expected to come on Thursday after overseas postal votes are counted.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Omega Rakotomalala &amp; Farouk Chothia"><Text>Said to have been a shy but intelligent boy in school, Burkina Faso's Capt Ibrahim Traoré has become the latest military officer to seize power in a coup in one of France's former colonies in West Africa. He overthrew his former comrade, Lt Col Paul-Henri Damiba on 30 September, after accusing him of failing to fulfil his promise of quelling the Islamist insurgency that has gripped Burkina Faso since 2015.Born in 1988, this makes the 34-year-old captain the youngest head of state in Africa, joining the ranks of two other coup leaders - Guinea's charismatic Col Mamady Doumbouya, born in 1981, and Mali's bearded Col Assimi Goïta, born in 1983."I know I'm younger than most of you here. We didn't want what happened but we didn't have a choice," Capt Traoré told government officials.During Lt-Col Damiba's short time in power, attacks by militant Islamists - some of them linked to the Islamic State group and al-Qaeda - increased in Burkina Faso as they seized territory in rural areas and encircled cities, leaving the state in control of only about 60% of the country, according to some estimates. With a lack of strong democratic institutions in a country where the military has long been dominant, Capt Traoré seized power with a pledge to improve security in a nation living in fear of the militants. His coup - the second in Burkina Faso in less than nine months - is the latest sign of the epidemic of coups that UN chief António Guterres raised concern about in 2021."My appeal, obviously, is for - especially the big powers - to come together for the unity of the Security Council in order to make sure that there is effective deterrence in relation to this epidemic of coup d'états," Mr Guterres said at the time. But with global powers focused either on domestic crises - or the war in Ukraine - they have paid little attention to the instability that has wracked countries such as Burkina Faso. If anything, Burkina Faso and some other countries have found themselves increasingly embroiled in the cold war rivalry that has been reignited by the Ukraine conflict, as Russia seeks to expands its influence in the region at the expense of France, which has retained close economic, military and cultural ties to many of its former colonies in Africa. "I know that France cannot interfere directly in our affairs," Capt Traoré said, adding: "The Americans are our partners now, [but] we can also have Russia as a partner."His comments suggest that he could follow the example of his counterpart in Mali, who has allegedly brought in the controversial Russian security group, Wagner, to replace the French in the fight against jihadists, albeit with little success, as the insurgency has worsened there too since the military staged a coup in August 2020. Capt Traoré cut his teeth fighting the jihadists in Mali. He served in a UN force there, and reportedly "showed bravery" in the face of a "complex attack" by militants in the northern Timbuktu region - famous for its centuries-old buildings -  in 2018.The following year, he participated in a military operation codenamed Otapuanu in Burkina Faso's restive east for seven months. He also served in a detachment of Markoye in the northern Sahel region and took part in several operations there."Traore is close to his men, wilful and courageous. He could not do six months without going to a detachment," an unnamed source was quoted as saying on Burkina Faso's Radio Omega.But Capt Traoré  is no decorated war general, only a captain who studied at a local military academy, joined the army in 2009 and received artillery training in Morocco.He chose a military career after completing his schooling in Burkina Faso's second city, Bobo-Dioulasso, with reports describing him as "shy and rather reserved" but also "very intelligent".Now, Capt Traoré has found himself at the centre of international glare, with some going as far as drawing parallels between him and Burkina Faso's famous revolutionary, Thomas Sankara - not surprising in a nation looking for political saviours after decades of misrule."Ibrahim Traoré has taken over the leadership of the country, like a certain Thomas Sankara, [and] like him after a military coup, captain like him, 34 years old like him.

Police responded by firing tear gas.In the panic to escape, people were trampled and crushed at the exits. At least 125 - including dozens of children, one as young as three - were killed, the authorities say.Some fans died in the arms of the players they had come to cheer on just hours earlier, the coach of home team Arema FC revealed."I can only mention a terrifying scenario," Sergio Silva, a Portuguese star for the side said. "Police cars on fire, everything broken, corridors with blood, people's shoes."People were desperate, they had seen people die and were trying to escape," he told Portuguese sports newspaper, A Bola.Authorities on Monday launched an investigation - following allegations of heavy-handed policing. Public anger has escalated - with mourners chanting "murderers" at officials. At least 18 police officers are being investigated for their action on field.So how did this all unfold? Here's what we know so far.There had been concerns in the lead-up to the game - between Arema FC and long-time rivals, Persebaya Surabaya, another East Java-based team - as violence between fans was not unprecedented. So extra precautions were put in place - including more security "for preventive measures", Maike Ira Puspita, deputy secretary-general of the Indonesian Football Association, told the BBC.They also banned visiting Persebaya fans from coming to the match, meaning it was just a home crowd - an over-capacity attendance of 42,000 people - who roared on their team on Saturday night.The FA also deployed extra police. And during the game's first half, all was "manageable". "The security happening like usual," says Ms Puspita. "Half-time was ok."Eyewitnesses have disputed this, telling the BBC there was scuffles at half time with tensions building throughout the second half.When the game ended, Arema had lost 3-2. "And this is the point when some of the supporters ran onto the pitch. And it all just started to break out from there," Ms Puspita said.It is unclear - and in fierce contention - what exactly happened next. Authorities are unwilling to even specify a chronology of what happened on the field."I think it's better for all of us to wait for the investigation team," Ms Puspita told the BBC.But what is known is that after the final whistle blew, Arema fans moved onto the pitch, where the team's footballers were gathered in the middle. Police had already escorted Persebaya to their changing rooms, the BBC's Indonesian service reported.Sergio Silva said many of those streaming onto the field had appeared to come to "show support, not attack". But recognising the situation was escalating, the team returned to the changing rooms.At some point, police began to fire tear gas into the thousands-strong crowd, volleys aimed at dispersing them. One eyewitness told the BBC that police fired tear gas rounds "continuously and fast".Witnesses say police were unnecessarily brutal - and that along with the clouds of stinging gas, officers were beating fans with batons.The gas had an overwhelming effect - sparking a mass exodus. Fans fled down the field, heading towards the stadium's narrow exits. But with a crowd of thousands beating at each others' backs, and with many still suffering gas inhalation, it became a crush at the gates.In the scrabble to get out, people punched and clawed holes in the wall to try and pull themselves free. The weight of people pushing against the iron gates left them bent outwards. In other places, the crush left some people dying by the changing rooms.Huddled in the locker rooms, Silva said he and his teammates spent what felt like hours barricading themselves. They heard the roar of the crowd, the screams of distress in the corridors."People were desperate, they had seen people die and were trying to escape. We ended up letting in some of these people," he said.It was, he said, a scenario more reminiscent "of destruction, of war... nothing to do with football". "Fans died in the arms of players," Javier Roca, the Arema coach, told Spanish broadcaster Cadena Ser. "I'm mentally shattered. I feel a heavy burden, even a heavy responsibility." He added: "I think the police overstepped their mark."The exact death toll is yet to be confirmed. Many fans are undergoing treatment, and some of those injured are reported have suffered brain injuries.Police have characterised what happened as a riot in which two officers also died. They've accused fans of attacking officers and damaging cars - the burnt-out wreckage of vehicles can be seen in photographs. But anger against officials is rising: at vigils across the nation, protests have broken out calling for police to be held accountable. In the capital Jakarta, mourners chanted "Murderer! Murderer!" and taped signs reading "Kanjuruhan Massacre" to fences.In Malang, anti-police messages have been graffitied on the Kanjuruhan stadium.On Monday, Mohammad Mahfud Mahmodin, Indonesia's minister for political, legal and security affairs, said the government was asking police to "reveal the perpetrators involved in the crime".He said a soldier had been seen in footage carrying out an unauthorised act, without specifying what it was.Separately, the police have announced an investigation into 18 officers who were "holding the throwing weapons".Indonesia is known for violent flare-ups between rival football supporters. The country's police force also has a record of brutality - and has been criticised for frequently using tear gas, despite it being banned by Fifa, world football's governing body, as a crowd control measure."In many riots in football stadiums, police are accustomed to using tear gas - this is an abnormality that has been normalised," said Fajar Junaedi, a lecturer and football researcher at the Universitas Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta.He noted a case in 2012, where a supporter died from being tear-gassed by police and there was no follow-up investigation.Ms Puspita had earlier declined to answer the BBC's question on whether the police use of tear gas was a standard accepted procedure in the Liga.She stressed the actions organisers had taken earlier in the year to help teams manage crowds, including security workshops for first league clubs and coordination with police."At this point, it is unfair to point fingers. This is something that's a black day for all of us - a tragic and devastating incident," she said.Additional reporting by Raja Lumbanrau off BBC Indonesian</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Katy Watson"><Text>When the results came through on Sunday evening, there were cheers for Lula - as well as tears - but the atmosphere felt more like a sense of relief than outright celebration. This wasn't the first-round victory that his supporters had wished for. The polls released a day before the elections had predicted a 14 percentage point gap between Lula and Bolsonaro. They had hoped Lula could avoid a run-off but they vastly underestimated the support for the right-wing leader."I've never won an election in the first round, it's like destiny wants me to work a bit more," Lula said, trying to reassure people of his chances. "We are going to win the elections again, it's just a question of time."Lula is still the front-runner and his position is still strong. But there is no doubt this has been a blow to the Lula campaign. In the past few weeks, there had been a concerted effort by his supporters to try and encourage wavering voters to choose Lula, to end the Bolsonaro presidency promptly.Lula and Bolsonaro to face run-off in BrazilWhy Brazil's election matters so much to the US'Our candidate isn't perfect, but he beats the alternative'The show of strength from the right - not just from Bolsonaro but prominent Bolsonaristas who were also elected to congress and as state governors - has taken people by surprise."Bolsonarism is much more alive and has a further reach than people had thought and polls had captured," says Esther Solano, a political scientist and Bolsonaro expert."What we underestimated was the network of regional Bolsonarism. We have to rethink how we are failing to measure the true reach of Bolsonarism in daily life across Brazil."In his post-results speech, Bolsonaro adopted a more humble tone than in the past - a break from his often fiery politics about the left. Perhaps a conscious effort to win over those who are still undecided."I know there's a desire to change from people but there are certain changes that can be for the worse," he said. "We tried to show that during the campaign but clearly that didn't get through to the most important layers of society."Bolsonaro vowed to show people how to ensure Brazil wouldn't become Venezuela - it's a common comparison that the far-right makes when criticising the left.In the run-up to this vote, Bolsonaro repeatedly said that the polls were a lie - and to many it looked like he was just a bad loser. But reflecting on Sunday's results, there are people who think that Bolsonaro has a point. It's certainly what Bolsonaro's supporters believe."It's time for liberty, for justice," says teacher Selma Cardoso who said the polls were biased. If Lula wins she's prepared to take action. "We'll go to the streets saying people are making a mistake. It's time to change - but peacefully."But others who support the president threaten to take a more violent approach."There's going to be beautiful blood spilled in this city," Alessandro Ferreira Soares, a parachutist, told me if Lula takes the presidency. "I'm prepared to kill all the socialists and communists in the world."It's these ominous threats that make people worried. These next four weeks are going to be intense - and personal. With two powerful political foes now going head-to-head, the campaign steps up several notches.There's everything to play for in this presidential race - and everything to lose if you're on the wrong side. We saw political violence in the run-up to the first round and there's real fear there will be more of that ahead of the run-off.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Hugh Schofield"><Text>If France wants to lead Europe to a new era of military self-reliance, how come its contribution to the war effort in Ukraine is so small?That is the awkward question being posed by some of the country's top strategic thinkers, who are pushing President Emmanuel Macron to make an urgent decision on more arms to Kyiv.Recent analysis conducted on the ground in Poland and Ukraine shows that the French share of foreign arms deliveries is less than 2%, way behind the US on 49%, but also behind Poland (22%) and Germany (9%)."I was concerned about the reliability of the statistics which showed France low on the list of contributing countries," says François Heisbourg, who is perhaps France's most influential defence analyst."So I went out to the main distribution hub in Poland to see how much in tonnage was actually being delivered, rather than just promised."Unfortunately the figures bore out my fears. France is way down the list - in ninth position."The official reaction to this in Paris is: "Yes, but..." Yes, the aid statistics are unflattering, but there are other factors at work.First, defence officials say the true measure of military help is quality not quantity. Some countries are delivering masses of outdated equipment. France has given 18 Caesar self-propelled artillery units, which are now celebrated along the Ukrainian front-line.France, they add, is like other Western countries in having run down military stocks as part of the post-Cold War peace dividend.Ukraine's Caesars are fully one quarter of France's entire mobile artillery. It cannot offer much more without making itself vulnerable in regions where it is already committed, like the Sahel and the Indo-Pacific."It might look like we are behind other countries, but France has every intention of playing its part," says Gen Jérome Pellistrandi, editor of the National Defence Review.These arguments are not without merit, says Mr Heisbourg. The problem is that by not being more present in theatre, France risks writing itself out of the plot."When I was in Kyiv, everyone was very polite. I had no sense that the Ukrainians disapproved of us," he says. "In a way it was worse. I had the distinct feeling we were becoming irrelevant."For Mr Heisbourg the equation is simple. Ukraine will talk to countries who it knows are likely to deliver the weapons it needs. France at the moment is not one of them.But there is another danger for France. Its relative absence in Ukraine undermines its bid for leadership in the cause of European defence.Already many countries of eastern Europe are wary of President Macron, who they believe was far too indulgent towards Russia's Vladimir Putin in the first months of the war. A narrative has taken root according to which France still feels ambivalent about an outright Ukrainian triumph.For Pierre Haroche, who lectures on international security at Queen Mary University of London, this narrative is unfair - and is not the reason for France's low levels of arms deliveries to Ukraine.However, he is firmly of the view that France should beef up its contribution as early as possible, in order to reassure eastern European countries like Poland that "we are all on the same page". "France's goal of strategic autonomy for Europe is focused primarily on building up our defence industries via joint procurement. But if you want joint procurement, you have to demonstrate to other countries that you have the same vision about our common security," he says."In order to make our objective of European co-operation viable, we need to show eastern European countries that co-operating with France and buying the idea of strategic autonomy is not a strategic risk."Dr Haroche is calling for France to send 50 Leclerc main battle tanks. Mr Heisbourg would prefer air defence systems, which he says Ukraine is more in need of."It is like a fire extinguisher," says Dr Haroche. "If there is a fire in a neighbour's house it is better to offer your extinguisher straightaway, and not wait till the fire reaches your own home."It's not just generosity. It's also for your own protection." </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Navin Singh Khadka"><Text>Renowned US ski mountaineer Hilaree Nelson, who died in the Himalayas a week ago, was cremated on Sunday in a Buddhist ceremony in Nepal's capital Kathmandu. Fellow climbers have been telling the BBC how she was an inspirational figure to a generation of women.In 2012 Hilaree Nelson became the first woman to climb Everest (8,849m; 29,032 feet) and its neighbour, Lhotse (8,516m), within 24 hours. Six years later she was back on Lhotse, and she and her partner, Jim Morrison, became the first to ski down the mountain.On Monday 26 September, the couple were skiing down another Himalayan mountain, Manaslu (8,163m), when they triggered an avalanche that swept Hilaree Nelson over a cliff to her death, at the age of 49.Many of those paying tribute to her have noted that she was the equal of any male climber."She was doing things with top male mountain athletes, side by side," said Dave Watson, an international mountain guide who was on Mt Manaslu with Nelson and Morrison, before the couple left to climb to the summit."Her efforts were erasing the label of 'first male'/ 'first female' - it was 'first person'."She was a ground-breaking mountain sports athlete, and she did it with grace and a big smile. Hilaree's influence cannot be overstated."The 36-year-old Swedish climber and adventure athlete, Maria Granberg, who attended Hilaree Nelson's funeral, described her as a trailblazer and a "curious, committed, rare and resilient spirit" who was a role model for younger women."She led expeditions reaching out a hand to the younger generation to follow, showing the ropes, and our future selves got the memo of how to show up as an athlete and human being."In the most human way, she paved the way and shed a light on everything that we as female athletes aspire to become, by creating a life and career coloured by grace, grit and wild aspirations."Another younger climber, Melissa Arnot Reid - the first American woman to climb Everest without supplemental oxygen - met Hilaree Nelson on Everest 10 years ago, on the expedition when Nelson achieved the double of Everest and Lhotse in 24 hours. "She was so strong, so driven but had such willingness to be vulnerable," she told the BBC."As a female in this industry, it's so difficult to be vulnerable without seeming weak, but she did that perfectly and in doing so, showed me what was possible."Her mountain skills and fitness and drive were incredible, but I'm certain she will mostly be remembered for remaining exceptionally human while doing superhuman things."Hilaree Nelson carried out more than 40 expeditions in 16 countries, from the high Himalayas to one of the most remote mountains in Myanmar, and also Antarctica, where in 2020 she climbed the continent's two highest peaks - and skied down both.Billi Bierling, who heads the Himalayan database - keeping records of all expeditions on the Nepalese Himalayas - met Ms Nelson after her record-breaking ski descent from Lhotse in 2018."It was amazing to meet her, she was a great ski mountaineer," she says."The whole mountaineering scene is still very much in male hands. You do have some amazing women climbers, but Hilaree was an extreme skier too, while mountain skiing is also mainly male-dominated."Dave Watson, who was on Manaslu with Hilaree Nelson and Jim Morrison before they left for the summit, says he decided to stay put at camp three, because there were strong winds and a risk of avalanches. In fact, on the same day that the couple reached the summit there was another avalanche that killed one Sherpa and injured more than a dozen other climbers.Jim Morrison got down safely, though, after seeing Hilaree Nelson swept away, and was one of those who found her body on Wednesday.The outpouring of grief seen among the mountaineering community is a sign of how badly it has been rocked by her death, Ms Bierling says."She was a loving and a committed mother of two beautiful children."But by the same token, she fulfilled her dreams and she was beautiful and always very humble."</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Orla Guerin"><Text>As Russia's Vladimir Putin announces the annexation of swathes of sovereign Ukrainian territory, issues nuclear threats and mobilises hundreds of thousands of reservists, the response from Ukrainian forces on the eastern front is unchanged - they will fight for every last inch of soil.We travel to front-line positions in the city of Bakhmut in Donetsk - one of the four regions which President Putin is now illegally claiming as his own. Our journey is made in stages.We slow down to cross the Bakhmutovka river, speed up to cover exposed ground, then weave through a dangerous curtain of downed power lines. For the last few metres, we run. All the while, the shelling is constant - part of war's familiar soundscape.But when we reach the front-line troops, inside a battle-scarred building, we hear something else - the crackle of small arms fire. The two sides are so close they can target each other with rifles.The Russians are around 400 metres (437 yards) in front of us, and trying hard to close in. We are warned there is a Russian sniper to the rear. At his post below ground, where a ginger cat keeps him company, the unit commander is sombre and blunt. "It's pretty hard here now," says Oleksandr, a 31-year-old. "It's stressful. Everyone is under pressure. The enemy is very near, but we are standing and fighting back."He dismisses President Putin's recent referendums as "delusional" and says Ukrainians will not be dictated to at the barrel of a Russian gun. "In my view, those referendums will change nothing. We will fight Putin's army and make them withdraw from our land," he says. Oleksandr knows the cost of war - and not only from fighting his own battles."My brother died," he tells me, adding: "But I don't know where and when that happened, because he was drafted by a different drafting office from a different region. He died as well as a few of my comrades, officers who trained with me. I found out they were dead, too. So, I have lost family and friends."He has not lost his will to fight. Neither has 25-year-old Roman, who is operating a key weapon in this war - a drone.Roman is upstairs in a bombed-out room, littered with debris and broken glass, where two more cats are in residence. The screensaver on his phone is a picture of his five-month-old son Kyrylo, born since the war broke out. He has seen his only child once. "I see him in pictures and video, not in real life," he says. "It's hard, but it's also hard to imagine what the Russians could do to my family if they reach them. "I don't want them to do what they did in Bucha. I lived in Kyiv, and I understand clearly how the women feel. If we are weak, they will come for our families."There is concern here about the mobilisation in Russia. In the coming months the Kremlin will be sending many more soldiers into battle.It is unclear how well-trained or well-equipped they will be, but the Ukrainians are worried about the quantity, not the quality. They are already outnumbered. In the battle for Bakhmut they have faced a seemingly endless supply of Russian fighters. In August there were five waves in a row, according to Iryna, an army spokeswoman."They just go, and they don't stop. They don't react to firing or shelling. Some of the prisoners of war we captured were from Wagner [a Russian mercenary group]. They had better weapons," Iryna says. Troops here believe the Russians are pushing hard for victory in Bakhmut because of their recent humiliating defeats in the north-east and the south, where Ukraine reclaimed about 6,000 sq km (2,317 sq miles) of territory.For now, Bakhmut is stuck in President Putin's throat. It is an obstacle in his bid to swallow all of a mineral rich area known as Donbas - comprised of Donestk and Luhansk.  Having failed to fully capture Donbas, he has annexed both regions.As he tries to conquer Bakhmut - once home to about 70,000 people - the city has been bled of life.Downtown we see a large apartment block with the centre gouged out by an airstrike three months ago. Many of the windows are boarded up. It looks abandoned, but my colleague hears a woman's cry inside the building.We call out, and Lyudmila appears from behind the plastic sheeting that covers her window on the second floor. At first, it is difficult to hear her over the deep rumble of rocket fire."It's very hard," she shouts. "They bombard us. Yesterday a man was killed in the backyard [by shelling]. There's almost no-one left in the building. "Everything is leaking. There is water everywhere. All the walls are cracked. It is very difficult. But at least we get humanitarian aid. Every three days, they bring bread."The white-haired pensioner is living in the shattered building with her husband and a handful of others. "We can't go anywhere," she tells us. "We have no money, and I am in a wheelchair." A neighbour tells us the building has been hit five times. Lyudmila was in her kitchen when the missile struck on 1 July. "It came, out of the blue," she says. "God himself saved me."But can this city be saved?For now, the frontline is holding. Ukrainian forces are blocking the Russian advance. But here even the dead are not safe.There is an old cemetery on the city's green outskirts, in the path of incoming shells. Mounds of dark soil top the fresh graves - those killed in recent months, since the city became a battleground.As a coffin is lowered into the ground - watched by a few mourners - the silence is broken by shelling. The first launch is outgoing, but moments later an incoming round lands in the hills opposite the graveyard. Then a second strike, closer still. It is time to leave.As we race towards the edge of Bakhmut there is an explosion on the road right in front of us, between 100 to 200 metres ahead. We manage a sharp left turn and follow another route out.Many battles are still raging in Ukraine. President Putin is doubling down - and winter is coming.This is a dangerous new phase in Europe's newest war.When asked how long she thought the conflict would last, the army spokeswoman replied: "A long, long time."</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Bernd Debusmann Jr and Alexandra Ostasiewicz"><Text>For Renee Smith and her paralysed, cancer-stricken husband Christopher, evacuation was not an option when Hurricane Ian came violently bearing down on their Florida home. "It would have taken an ambulance, a stretcher, and three grown men to move him," she said of Christopher, who became paralysed just days before the hurricane as a result of prostate cancer spreading to his spine. "I had no control and it was terrifying."Without any other choices, Mrs Smith resorted to desperate measures to protect her husband. She used cable ties and gaffer tape to attach a tarpaulin to his hospital bed in a bid to keep him dry and used his wheelchair to barricade the front door from the 150mph (241km/h) winds. Even that, she feared, may have not been enough. "I'm his caretaker, so I stayed," she told the BBC from her home in Punta Gorda - one of the Gulf Coast communities hardest hit by the category four storm. "I put a life preserver around his neck, kissed him and told him I loved him."In Mrs Smith's case, the danger primarily came from the hurricane's ferocious winds. Many others were hit by a powerful storm surge. Suzie Mack, a Fort Myers resident, told the BBC that her brother's mobile home park saw water as high as 8ft during the storm. "They got on their air mattresses inside their house, because it was too late to leave, and by the time the surge got to its peak, they had about a foot of air left in their homes," she said. "Nobody died there, but it was a horrific story to hear." Not everyone was so lucky. So far, Florida officials have confirmed 44 deaths from the hurricane across the state - most of these in Lee County - with US networks reporting even higher tolls. Hurricane Ian - Maps and images showing destructionIn Pictures: Floridians take in Hurricane Ian's impactIn Ian's wake, some Florida residents have come under criticism for failing to heed repeated warnings and calls to evacuate. But for families like the Smiths and hundreds of thousands of others, logistical and financial hurdles to evacuation meant that staying was the only option. Others were simply trapped by bad luck.A woman who identified herself as Melodye, for example, fled from her home in the Tampa Bay area to Fort Myers. By the time it was clear that Ian's track had shifted south, it was too late for her to leave. "My area turned out to be safe, never got hit," she told the BBC at a mobile home park near Fort Myers. "I came down here and experienced the worst thing I've ever experienced in my whole life.""If there is another, I'm going to Chicago," she added. While for the moment the scale of Ian's destruction remains unclear, independent experts have warned that the economic impact is likely to be well into the tens of billions of dollars. Consultancy firm Milliman estimated that only 18% of people in areas under evacuation order had flood insurance, putting many residents in difficult or impossible financial situations as they seek to rebuild their homes or recover their losses. Governor Ron DeSantis - who called Ian a "500-year flood event" - said that the storm may well have "changed the character of our state".In these conditions, many Florida residents have been left wondering what their future looks like - and whether to stay in the state or to leave.  Tom, a 48-year-old resident of the town of Port Charlotte, 38 miles (61km) from Fort Myers, told the BBC that he decided to leave the morning after the storm along with his 66-year-old mother, Kathy. While the pair had already planned a move to Colorado, the hurricane prompted them to pack up and leave the morning after Ian passed. "The town is destroyed," Kathy said. So was her home for the last six years.For residents of the Sun Seekers mobile home park in North Fort Myers - many of them transplants from other parts of the US - the government may make the decision to relocate for them by declaring the property "uninhabitable". Cindy Brackett, a resident of the mobile home park, said that the prospect of being forced from her home was an additional and unwelcome trauma, just days after the violent hurricane. "With my arthritis, I can't do anything. I can't even walk out of my home. I feel so useless," Ms Brackett said. She doesn't want to leave and isn't sure where she would go if she had to.Federal officials and the American Red Cross say that about 10,000 displaced people are currently in shelters - not including people who may have taken shelter with friends, family or left the area entirely. State and federal officials have promised millions of dollars in relief funds, but many people on the ground remain sceptical of how - and whether - it will reach them. For those able - and willing - to stay, the effort to rebuild has already begun. Across damaged parts of western Florida, the BBC saw people beginning to clear debris from their homes and businesses, sweeping away palm fronds and parts of shattered houses. In some places, people were working to clear cars that had been overturned or crushed by felled trees, or boats that had been left sitting useless and far from the water."People around here are devastated," said Cal Bruno, the owner of a Fort Myers restaurant that gave away thousands of pasta meals to residents for free after the storm. "But we'll come together." Among those vowing to stay to help with the effort is construction worker Alejandro Carrera, an Argentine immigrant and 14-year resident of Fort Myers. "We will rebuild," he told the BBC, standing just feet from a shattered local marina. "I work in construction. I'm going to have a ton of work."Phoebe Gavin, a Washington-DC based native of Sanibel Island - whose aging parents fled across a causeway to nearby Fort Myer just ahead of the storm - said that she's "pessimistic" about the island's immediate reconstruction. Sanibel - which is located just off the coast and has a population of about 6,000 - was among the hardest-hit communities during the hurricane.Parts of the causeway connecting the barrier island to Florida were destroyed during the storm, severing access from the rest of the state. "I can't see it as a top priority as far as rebuilding," she said. "It would be shocking to me if we saw previous levels of road traffic within the next year."  A lack of connectivity to the mainland, she said, would be devastating to a community which survives largely on tourism. The alternative to a working causeway - a ferry - could potentially drive tourists away. "A lot of people would choose a much easier option," she said. Just across the shattered causeway in Fort Myers, pensioner Lucia Kim said that while she is confident that local communities will get back to normal sooner than later, she fears that some of the "spirit" of the area might be lost. "There is an atmosphere here," said Ms Kim, who moved from New York a decade ago attracted by the freedom and sense of community. "Just look at the 1960s architecture as well," she added, gesturing at art deco buildings in the distance. "Who knows what comes next?" After Hurricane Ian passed, Renee Smith cautiously emerged from her home to survey the damage.What she found wasn't encouraging. Her driveway remains covered in debris and detritus from nearby buildings, including some items she immediately recognised as having been ripped from a four-storey hotel blocks away. To make matters worse, Mrs Smith's front door won't shut, her chimney has collapsed and parts of her roof were blown away, leaving her and her bedridden husband partially exposed to the elements. Mrs Smith, however, sees things that may suggest that the damage in her devastated community could ultimately lead to a stronger and more resilient neighbourhood. Many of the buildings rebuilt after previous hurricanes - such as 2004's Hurricane Charley - managed to weather the storm better than the rest of the town. In any case, her husband's condition means that rain or shine, she'll be staying put. She has no choice.  For the moment, however, she is simply happy that mother nature has given her a reprieve. Since Hurricane Ian passed, the sun is back out while Florida's often oppressive heat has been replaced by more comfortable temperatures. "We're very fortunate," she said of the conditions after the storm. "It could have been a lot worse."Additional reporting from John Sudworth and Azadeh Moshiri</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Orla Guerin"><Text>Victory can look desolate. It does inside the eastern Ukrainian town of Lyman, retaken from the Russians at the weekend. The deserted debris-strewn streets are lined by boarded up or burnt-out buildings. Metal sheeting dangling from smashed roofs is buffeted by the wind. Few civilians venture out. We counted almost as many dogs as people - though the population was around 20,000 before the war.The handful of civilians we met seem shell-shocked by months of bombardment, and uncertain their ordeal is over.The only surge of life was a convoy of Ukrainian troops riding high on top of armoured personnel carriers, waving and cheering, as they headed out of town, along a road bordered by pine forest.They roared past evidence of the human cost of Russia's defeat.The bodies of five dead Russian soldiers lay near each other, now bloated, and contorted by death, but once somebody's husband or somebody's son. They were in full uniform, with boots still on, as if they might somehow return to the fight.  They appear to have been cut down together as they tried to flee. Nearby we saw a heap of discarded Russian uniforms, sleeping bags, and ration packs. There was an army backpack with a name written on it. We don't know what became of its owner. Two young volunteers from a Ukrainian humanitarian group were working carefully and quietly, numbering the bodies, and looking for anything that might identify them.   They were kneeling just metres away from mines scattered along the roadside, their dark green colour camouflaged by the grass and leaves. They are a lingering threat from an enemy that has been driven into retreat, or as Russia's defence ministry put it, was "withdrawn to more advantageous positions". That statement has a familiar ring to it after the domino of Russian routs last month in Kharkiv province in the north-east.Later the volunteers manoeuvred the remains into black body bags and drove them away - some of Russia's fallen soldiers finally leaving the battlefield.A new Ukrainian flag was flying atop a captured Russian T72  tank, parked by the roadside. "We are going to win," said the smiling young Ukrainian soldier clambering around the gun turret. "I feel very good, very great." What happened here isn't just a defeat for President Vladimir Putin. It's a complete humiliation. Just last Friday he announced to the world he was annexing four Ukrainian regions, including Donetsk, where Lyman is located. He proclaimed that they would be "Russian forever".A day later Ukrainian forces were inside Lyman, and his troops were running for their lives.Ukraine says as many as 5,000 Russian troops were encircled in Lyman, before the town fell. We don't know how many were killed or captured. The defence ministry in Kyiv said in a tweet that almost all the Russian troops deployed to Lyman had been "redeployed either into body bags or into captivity".The strategic town is a gateway to the neighbouring region of Luhansk, which is almost entirely in Russia's grip. Ukraine is hoping to advance further, using its victory here as a springboard.Lena and her 10-year-old Radion are hoping for peace, and for running water.  We met the mother and son heading for a well to refill a five-litre container."I think it will be peaceful," said Lena, who wore a black hat and a few layers of woollen jumpers, "It should be peaceful. Everyone has suffered enough. The hardest thing was to survive the shelling. We prayed as we stayed in the cellar. The situation is still tense but overall, I am happy."While deprived of school, Radion has learnt the lessons of war. His face is sombre, beneath his deep blue hat. "It was a bit scary in Lyman," he tells us "because there was a lot of bombing. War is very bad because people are dying. It's more peaceful in my heart now."Others here still seem lost in their trauma, like 66-year-old Nadia. She was alone on the streets, walking slowly, as if she could not recognise her surroundings."I hope for the best," she said "and that they [the Russians] won't come back here. It was very bad. Both sides were firing. We didn't understand anything. When it was quiet, we went outside to cook. Then it started again. We have all gone mad now."And she had a question for us. "Why am I being bombarded?" she beseeched us. "I didn't do anything bad. I didn't kill. I didn't steal. I don't understand why. Maybe you can tell me. We lived well, everything was good, we worked.  And in one moment it was turned upside down."In the streets around town pro-Russian slogans have been daubed on walls, kiosks and bus shelters. "CCCP" is daubed on a closed shop front - the Cyrillic letters for USSR, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.Much as President Putin may wish to resurrect the Soviet Union of his youth, the ruins of Lyman stand as testament to his failure.Ukraine now has momentum and knows it must move fast, Western weapons supplies permitting. Battle lines will harden when freezing weather comes. The window for reclaiming more territory this winter may close in a few weeks. </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Laurence Peter and Matt Murphy"><Text>Ukrainian troops have retaken more territory in regions illegally annexed by Russia, with Kyiv's forces advancing near the southern city of Kherson and consolidating gains in the east. Russian-installed officials in Kherson confirmed the advance, but said Moscow's forces were digging in.Ukrainian troops also moved towards Russian-held Luhansk in the east.Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said "there are new liberated settlements in several regions".Speaking during his nightly address, President Zelensky said "fierce fighting continues in many areas", but he did not give details. The progress of Ukraine's counterattacks have been closely guarded and reporters have largely been kept away from the front lines.But in the south, Vladimir Saldo, the Russian-installed leader in the Kherson region, admitted that Ukrainian forces had broken through near Dudchany, a town on the Dnipro river about 30km (20 miles) south of the previous front line. The river is called Dnieper by Russians."There are settlements that are occupied by Ukrainian forces," Mr Saldo said. Some Russian reports say the Ukrainians have now taken Dudchany.Russian defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said "numerically superior" Ukrainian tanks had "driven a deep wedge" south of Zolota Balka, a village that marked the previous front line on the Dnipro. He claimed the Russians had killed about 130 Ukrainian troops in that fighting.According to Mr Saldo, two Ukrainian battalions tried to reach the Kakhovka hydroelectric station, about 70km (44 miles) east of Kherson. The power station is in the port city of Nova Kakhovka. The Ukrainian advance is targeting supply lines for as many as 25,000 Russian troops on the west bank of the Dnipro, Reuters news agency reports.Meanwhile, in the east, Kyiv's troops have continued an advance that has made inroads into Luhansk, a province annexed by Moscow last week and previously under almost complete Russian control. On Saturday, Ukrainian forces recaptured the important hub town of Lyman in the east, near the Luhansk regional border. Russia's military had turned Lyman into a logistical base.A commander of Russia's proxy forces in Luhansk said Ukrainian troops had pushed a few kilometres into the region before being killed. The BBC cannot confirm these claims. And reports suggest that the Ukrainians are moving towards the Russian-held towns of Kreminna and Svatove in Luhansk, with some pro-Kremlin bloggers suggesting that Russian forces have again been ordered to retreat.Kherson and Luhansk are among four regions which Russian President Vladimir Putin has declared to be part of Russia, following so-called referendums denounced as fraudulent by Kyiv and its Western allies. Russia does not fully control any of the four regions.On Monday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov attracted ridicule online after he admitted that Russia was still deciding which areas it had "annexed", suggesting that Moscow does not know where its self-declared borders are. Mr Peskov claimed the entirety of Luhansk and Donetsk regions were part of Russia, but said the Kremlin would "continue consultations with the population regarding the borders of the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions". Kyiv has vowed to retake all the territory annexed by Russia, including Crimea, seized by Russian troops in 2014.The Russian defence ministry says reservists drafted under Mr Putin's mobilisation order last month are undergoing intensive combat training in the Russian-controlled Luhansk and Donetsk regions. The Kremlin plans to call up about 300,000 reservists - though Mr Putin did not set an upper limit.ANALYSIS: Who is winning the war in Ukraine?ON THE GROUND: What weapons are being supplied to Ukraine?READ MORE: Full coverage of the crisis</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By David Gritten"><Text>Schoolgirls in Iran have been waving their headscarves in the air and chanting against clerical authorities, in an unprecedented show of support for the protests engulfing the country.Videos verified by the BBC showed demonstrations inside schoolyards and on the streets of several cities.They echoed the wider unrest sparked by the death last month of a woman who was detained for breaking the hijab law.In Karaj, girls reportedly forced an education official out of their school.Footage posted on social media on Monday showed them shouting "shame on you" and throwing what appear to be empty water bottles at the man until he retreats through a gate.The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterIn another video from Karaj, which is just to the west of the capital Tehran, students are heard shouting: "If we don't unite, they will kill us one by one." In the southern city of Shiraz on Monday, dozens of schoolgirls blocked traffic on a main road while waving their headscarves in the air and shouting "death to the dictator" - a reference to the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the final say on all state matters.The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterFurther protests by schoolgirls were reported on Tuesday in Karaj, Tehran and the north-western cities of Saqez and Sanandaj.A number of students were also photographed standing in their classrooms with their heads uncovered. Some were raising their middle fingers - an obscene gesture - at portraits of Ayatollah Khamenei and the founder of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.Analysis by Rana Rahimpour, BBC PersianAfter almost three weeks of protests, it is clear that Iran's leadership is facing a serious challenge. Its opponents are no longer just politicians or people in their 20s. It is now facing teenagers - schoolgirls who are not scared of burning photos of the supreme leader.The protests have continued despite Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's warning on Monday that they were "riots" orchestrated by the West. Many of those taking part simply want a normal life. They might not understand politics, but they understand that they are not free to live their lives the way they want. Now, every school and university could potentially become a headquarters for the protesters. Every day at school, teenagers will be able to get together and exchange ideas about how to overthrow the regime. The question is whether and how the Islamic Republic will be able to stop them. The protests by the schoolgirls began hours after Ayatollah Khamenei, who has final say on all state matters, broke his silence on the unrest and accused the United States and Israel, Iran's arch-enemies, of orchestrating "riots".  He also gave his full backing to the security forces, which have responded to the protests with a violent crackdown.The unrest was triggered by the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish woman who fell into a coma after being detained by morality police on 13 September in Tehran for allegedly violating the law requiring women to cover their hair with a hijab, or headscarf. She died in hospital three days later.Her family has alleged that officers beat her head with a baton and banged her head against one of their vehicles. The police have denied that she was mistreated and said she suffered "sudden heart failure".The first protests took place in Kurdish-populated north-western Iran, where Ms Amini lived, and then spread rapidly across the country. Iran Human Rights, a Norway-based group, reported on Tuesday that at least 154 people had been killed by security forces so far. They include 63 protesters whom ethnic Baluch activists said had died in clashes in the south-eastern city of Zahedan on Friday.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Elsa Maishman"><Text>At least four people have been killed and dozens are missing after an avalanche struck a team of mountaineers high in the Indian Himalayas.The 34 trainees and seven instructors were practising navigation when they were hit on their descent from a peak in the northern state of Uttarakhand. Eight of the party are believed to have been rescued and the rest are trapped in a crevasse, rescuers say.Search efforts have been paused for the night because of rain and snowfall.Local media reports say the number of casualties may rise significantly. The group was made up of trainees from the nearby Nehru Institute of Mountaineering. It said they had been returning from Mount Draupadi Danda-2 (5,670m; 18,602 feet) when the avalanche struck. Authorities were alerted at around 09:30 local time on Tuesday (04:00 GMT), rescue workers said. "We have confirmation of four deaths out of the 33 people trapped. Around eight of them have already been rescued and the rest are trapped in a crevasse," Ridhim Aggarwal from the State Disaster Response Force told AFP news agency. Rescue efforts will continue as long as the weather allows, he said. Earlier, Uttarakhand police chief Ashok Kumar told Reuters news agency: "The Indian Air Force is doing an aerial recce of the mountain where this happened. It is not easy to reach the spot." Defence Minister Rajnath Singh wrote on Twitter: "Deeply anguished by the loss of precious lives due to landslide which has struck the mountaineering expedition carried out by the Nehru Mountaineering Institute in Uttarkashi."It comes a week after the body of famed US ski mountaineer Hilaree Nelson was found in the Nepali Himalayas. Ms Nelson, regarded as one of the greatest mountaineers of her generation, was reported to have fallen into a deep crevasse after reaching the summit of Mount Manaslu.On the same day she went missing, one person was killed and more than a dozen injured in an avalanche lower down on the same peak.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Hugh Schofield"><Text>Paris has become the latest French city to announce that it will not be setting up giant screens and fan zones for the approaching World Cup in Qatar.It cited human rights and environmental concerns in the host nation.Lille, Marseille, Bordeaux, Strasbourg and Reims are also boycotting the competition on ethical grounds.Pierre Rabadan, in charge of sport at Paris City Hall, said the fact the event was taking place in winter was also a factor in the city's decision.The movement began on Saturday after the Socialist mayor of Lille, Martine Aubry, declared that the Qatar World Cup was a "nonsense in terms of human rights, the environment and sport".Like other mayors - of both left and right - she blamed concerns over workers' rights in Qatar; the alleged high number of deaths among foreign labourers; and the environmental impact of the stadiums, all equipped with outdoor air conditioning.In Marseille, there had been plans for a giant screening if France made it to the final, but that has now been cancelled.The city's Socialist mayor, Benoit Payan, said the competition "had progressively turned itself into a human and environmental catastrophe, incompatible with the values which we expect sport - and especially football - to promote".It was unclear how many French cities were actually making preparations for outdoor venues where supporters could follow the progress of the French team, world champions in Russia 2018.The mayor of Angoulême in south-west France said his decision was as much financial as to do with human rights in Qatar.Why is the Qatar World Cup so controversial?FA criticised for 'delay' over Qatar statement"It seemed incongruous to us to risk this kind of expense at a time when we are trying to make economies to absorb the growing cost of energy," said Xavier Bonnefont, citing a giant screen cost of "several tens of thousands of euros"."In any case frankly in winter I don't think there would have been many people turning up. The public will be just as happy in a bar."Calls for a boycott of the World Cup, which takes place between 21 November and 18 December, have been growing in France, though they remain far from mainstream.The former international and Manchester United star Eric Cantona said he would not be watching any matches, adding: "Let's be honest, this World Cup makes no sense. It is an aberration."Government spokesman Olivier Véran said: "If we were to make the decision today, we would not give the World Cup to Qatar.  However when something was decided 10 years ago by 100 countries, it's difficult to say stop just a few weeks before it gets under way."</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="BBC News, author unspecified"><Text>Twitter shares have been suspended following a report that Elon Musk will proceed with a takeover of the social media platform.Mr Musk is set to buy Twitter at the original price he offered months ago before he walked away from a deal, sources told US media.Shares in Twitter were up almost 13% before trading was halted.Mr Musk was due to face Twitter in court later this month after he tried to pull out of the takeover.Mr Musk offered to pay $54.20 per share for the company in April, in a deal that valued the social media platform at $44bn.But he balked at the deal just a few weeks later, citing concerns that the number of bots on the platform was higher than Twitter claimed.Twitter denied the accusations and sued Mr Musk to force the deal to go through.The back-and-forth came amid a sharp downturn in the value of technology stocks, including Tesla, the electric car company that Mr Musk leads and is the base of much of his wealth. Twitter accused Mr Musk of wanting out because he was worried about the price.The fight between Mr Musk and Twitter, which was scheduled to go to trial 17 October, had ensnarled many of the biggest names in tech, as lawyers for the two companies demanded communications about the deal.Mr Musk, who could have paid a $1bn break-up fee to walk away from the deal, was set to be interviewed ahead of the trial this week.Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said Mr Musk's chance of winning was "highly unlikely"."Being forced to do the deal after a long and ugly court battle in Delaware was not an ideal scenario and instead accepting this path and moving forward with the deal will save a massive legal headache," he wrote in a report after the news.But he added, that Mr Musk's ownership of the platform, a top venue for politicians and journalists to spread news and opinion, would still likely to cause a "firestorm of worries and questions" in Washington and beyond.It's never dull with Musk. Elon Musk has for months now been trying to get out of this deal. In doing so he has argued that Twitter is full of bots.He has said on multiple occasions that Twitter may have many times more fake accounts than it admits to.By making these claims he has helped to tarnish the reputation of the company.Advertisers are nervous - they want to buy ads that are seen by humans, with wallets, not bots.So for Elon Musk to then offer to buy the company again, at the initial price, seems bizarre.Twitter is reportedly looking at Mr Musk's offer closely. Musk's behaviour in this deal has so far been erratic. Could this be a legal strategy to delay a court case?But if this reported offer is credible it's a massive win for Twitter's shareholders and its lawyers. Many Twitter employees, however, will be less pleased. I've spoken to several employees who are privately nervous about a Musk takeover, and what that might mean for moderation policies - and more acutely - their own job security.And as for Twitter's CEO Parag Agrawal? Well emails disclosed last week suggests he doesn't get along well with Musk.A Musk Twitter takeover would almost certainly mean a new person in charge of the company.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="BBC News, author unspecified"><Text>A Nigerian boy has been killed by his brother while testing a newly bought "bullet-proof" charm, police say.The two believed they had "fortified themselves with the protective charm", according to police in Kwara stateAbubakar Abubakar then shot at his younger brother Yusuf, 12, using their father's rifle, officers say.

He was then arrested for kicking an officer while in custody.Gilman told the court in Voronezh, south-western Russia, that he did not remember the incident but "apologised to Russia" and to the officer.After being found guilty, Gilman - 28 and from Massachusetts - said the sentence requested by the prosecution was too strict.The lawyers told TASS, the Russian state news agency, that Gilman was in Russia to study and obtain citizenship. Gilman was reportedly staying in Sochi, but headed by train to Moscow to replace his damaged passport at the US Embassy.His lawyers said they would appeal against the court's decision and contact US officials to seek a prisoner exchange.There have been several high-profile cases of Americans being sentenced to lengthy prison terms in Russia recently. This could lead to prisoner swaps, a process often seen as "hostage diplomacy", where countries try to use people as bargaining chips. Another ex-marine, Trevor Reed, was freed in April in a prisoner swap after being found guilty of violence against a police officer on a night out in Russia.And another former US marine, Paul Whelan, is serving 16 years for spying charges after a short trial was conducted entirely behind closed doors.He maintains his innocence, and describes himself the victim of "greasy, slimy Russian politics".How Brittney Griner's case throws spotlight on hostage diplomacyUS basketball star Brittney Griner was sentenced to nine years in prison on drug charges by a Russian court in August.The double Olympic winner admitted possessing cannabis oil, but told the court she had made an "honest mistake".The US claims she's being wrongfully detained. It is unclear how long she will spend behind bars, as the US and Russia have reportedly discussed a prisoner swap involving Russian arms trafficker, Viktor Bout. </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Mark Savage"><Text>Loretta Lynn, whose songs of strength and independence made her a standard-bearer for women in country music, has died at the age of 90.Known as the Queen of Country, her songs were rooted in real-life experience, most notably on the autobiographical Coal Miner's Daughter.Other hits included Don't Come Home A-Drinkin', Honky Tonk Girl and the feminist anthem, The Pill.Lynn's family said she died on Tuesday at her home in Tennessee."Our precious mom, Loretta Lynn, passed away peacefully this morning, October 4th, in her sleep at home in her beloved ranch in Hurricane Mills," the family said in a statement. They asked for privacy as they grieve and said a memorial would be announced later.  The singer was born Loretta Webb in a one-room log cabin in Butcher Hollow, Kentucky in 1932. She was the second of eight children.Just as she would later sing in Coal Miner's Daughter, her family eked out a living during the Depression, with her father earning a "poor man's dollar" by working all night in the coal mines, and all day in the fields "a-hoein' corn".The family made its own entertainment - her mother played guitar, with her father accompanying on banjo - and she grew up on the songs of the Carter Family."I was singing when I was born, I think," she told the Associated Press in 2016. "Daddy used to come out on the porch where I would be singing and rocking the babies to sleep. "He'd say, 'Loretta, shut that big mouth. People all over this holler can hear you.' And I said, 'Daddy, what difference does it make? They are all my cousins.'"At the age of 15, she attended a "pie social" - where local girls would bake a pie, and men would bid to win both the food and a meeting with the cook. Loretta's pie, accidentally baked with salt instead of sugar, was won by Oliver Lynn, a 21-year-old solider, who swept her off her feet. A month later, they married and moved to Custer, Washington, where they raised four children.Her husband, whom she called "Doo" or "Doolittle," urged her to sing professionally and bought her a $17 (£15) Sears guitar, with which she started a band, Loretta and the Trailblazers, that also featured her brother Jay Lee Webb.By 1960, she had signed a contract with Zero Records and released her debut single, I'm a Honky Tonk Girl. The song was inspired by a woman Lynn befriended in Washington, whose husband had left her for another woman. Lynn said she wrote the song while leaning up against an old toilet in her house, the words pouring out of her in a 10-minute burst of inspiration.She and her husband promoted the song relentlessly, driving to radio stations around the country to pester DJs into playing it, and sending out hundreds of free discs.The effort paid off. I'm A Honky Tonk Girl reached number 14 on the country charts, and Lynn relocated to Nashville, where she was quickly snapped up by Decca Records. She released her first Decca record, Success, in 1962, beginning an impressive stretch of hits that continued into the 1990s.Lynn earned her first number one with Don't Come Home a Drinkin' (With Lovin' on Your Mind) in 1966, and topped the US country charts another 15 times. She recorded 60 albums in total, and was nominated for 18 Grammy Awards, winning three.Her songs frequently depicted broken relationships and unhappy homes - but were unusual for expressing a female point of view at a time when that was unheard of in country music. Many addressed Doolittle's infidelity and alcoholism. You Ain't Woman Enough (To Take My Man) and Fist City were feisty warnings to any woman who considered approaching her husband, while 1971's I Wanna Be Free fantasised about divorce. "I'm gonna take this chain from around my finger / And throw it just as far as I can sling," sang Lynn."I've wrote every song I ever wrote about him," she told a BBC Arena documentary. "He gave me a lot of opportunities."Lynn later confessed that the relationship could turn violent - although she gave as good as she got."If he smacked me or anything, I'd stand up and be fightin' him just like I'd be fightin' the other woman," she told PBS's American Masters documentary in 2016. "He'd smack me, I'd smack him; he'd pull my hair, I pulled his hair. That's the way it was." Despite their troubles, the couple stayed together for 48 years until Oliver's death in 1996.Lynn's songs weren't just about relationships, however. Dear Sam was inspired by the women left at home during the Vietnam War, with lyrics that ran: "Don't misunderstand/ I know he's fighting for our land / I really love my country/ But I also love my man", while The Pill was a frank and funny celebration of reproductive choice. "This old maternity dress I've got is going in the garbage/The clothes I'm wearing from now on won't take up so much yardage," sang the star. "Miniskirts, hot pants and a few little fancy frills/Yeah, I'm making up for all those years since I've got the pill."Although she wasn't initially credited as a writer, it later transpired she had played a part in its composition. Speaking to NPR in 2010, the mother of six said the lyrics spoke directly to her own experiences."If I'd had [the pill] I would have used it," she said. "'Cause back when I was having all the kids, we didn't have birth-control pills. Or if we did, I didn't know anything about them."The subject matter meant her record label held the single back for several years. When it was finally released in 1975, many country radio stations refused to play it, keeping it from hitting number one. But it still reached the top five, and became Lynn's biggest crossover pop hit.By that time, Lynn had begun a professional partnership with country star Conway Twitty, with whom she scored hits like After the Fire Is Gone, Louisiana Woman, Mississippi Man and As Soon As I Hang Up The Phone. The musicians were named vocal duo of the year by the Country Music Association for four consecutive years from 1972 to 1975.Lynn published her autobiography, also called Coal Miner's Daughter, in 1976, and it was turned into a film in 1980, earning Sissy Spacek an Oscar for best actress.The musician's output slowed in the 1980s and she announced her retirement in the 1990s - although she still managed to release a handful of albums, including 1993's Honky Tonk Women, a collaboration with fellow country music trailblazers Dolly Parton and Tammy Wynette. In the meantime, she turned her attention to food, launching a restaurant called Loretta Lynn's Kitchen, and a series of cookbooks that mixed recipes with stories from her life.She also opened the Loretta Lynn Ranch in Tennessee - Lynn's equivalent to Parton's Dollywood - which hosts a museum and campsite, and stages regular music events. In 2004, her career was resurrected by super-fan Jack White, who encouraged her back into the studio for an album that combined his abrasive rock sound with Lynn's penchant for pedal steel and banjo.The album showed that her narrative power was undiminished (one song, Ms Leroy Brown, told of a bored housewife who stole her husband's savings to rent a limousine and go on a bender) and gained her a new audience at the age of 72, as well as the Grammy Award for best country album.In 2013, Lynn was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honour in the United States, by President Barack Obama.Later albums included Full Circle, a mix of new songs and remakes of old standards, and 2021's Still Woman Enough, which saw her duet with Margo Price and Tanya Tucker.Lynn stopped touring in 2017 after a stroke, and suffered a broken hip after falling over at home the following year. But she continued to perform and record, and forcefully denied tabloid reports at the time that her health was failing."Through the years they've said I'm broke, homeless, cheating, drinking, gone crazy, terminally ill, and even dead! Poor things can't ever get it right," she wrote on Facebook. "I guess if those old pesky tabloids are harassing me then they're giving someone else a break... but I'm about an inch from taking 'em to Fist City!"It was that down-to-earth gutsiness that endeared her to fans over the last six decades, and one that ensures her music still feels relevant."I like real life, because that's what we're doing today," she said 2004. "And I think that's why people bought my records, because they're living in this world and so am I. So I see what's going on, and I grab it."Lynn is survived by four of her six children: Clara, Ernest and twins Peggy and Patsy, as well as 17 grandchildren and four step-grandchildren.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Jean Mackenzie, Yvette Tan &amp; Rupert Wingfield-Hayes"><Text>North Korea has fired a ballistic missile over Japan, in what appears to be a deliberate escalation to get the attention of Tokyo and Washington.The missile travelled 4,500km (2,800 miles) before falling into the Pacific Ocean - far enough to hit the US island of Guam if it took another trajectory.It is the North's first missile launch over Japan since 2017. Japan issued an alert to some citizens to take cover.The US, Japan and South Korea conducted their own military drills in response.South Korean and US aircraft fired at a mock target on an uninhabited island in the Yellow Sea, while the US and Japan also jointly carried out drills over the Sea of Japan.The UN prohibits North Korea from testing ballistic and nuclear weapons. Flying missiles towards or over other countries without any warning or consultation also contravenes international norms. Most countries avoid doing it completely as it can easily be mistaken for an attack. While it is not as big as a nuclear test - which could be next - it can be considered hugely provocative.People in the north of Japan, including Hokkaido island and Aomori city, reportedly woke up to the noise of sirens and text alerts which read: "North Korea appears to have launched a missile. Please evacuate into buildings or underground."As the missile flew overhead, they were warned to look out for falling debris. Many remained calm, though, with one video showing Tokyo commuters walking normally as loudspeakers blared out warnings. But others were more shaken. "If a missile hit, I was worried it would be a big problem not only here but also nationwide," Aomori resident Kazuko Ebina told the Asahi Shimbun newspaper.Officials later said the intermediate-range ballistic missile fell into the Pacific Ocean far from Japan, and there were no reported injuries.It had covered the longest distance ever travelled by a North Korean missile, and reached a height of around 1,000km - higher than the International Space Station. Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida described the launch as "violent behaviour", while defence minister Yasukazu Hamada said Japan would not rule out any options to strengthen its defences including "counterattack capabilities". US President Joe Biden reinforced Washington's "ironclad commitment" to Japan's defence during a phone call with Mr Kishida, while the two leaders jointly condemned the missile test, a White House statement said.They confirmed they would work closely with South Korea and the international community to coordinate an immediate and longer-term response to the threat posed by the North, it added.Last week, the three countries conducted naval exercises together for the first time since 2017. Such drills have long antagonised Pyongyang leader Kim Jong-un, who views them as proof that his enemies are preparing for war. Following the combined exercises in 2017, North Korea fired two missiles over Japan in response. A week later, it conducted a nuclear test.Recent intelligence has suggested that North Korea is getting ready to test another nuclear weapon.It is expected that North Korea would wait until after China - its main ally - holds its Communist party congress later this month.But some experts are now asking if it could come sooner than expected - they believe Tuesday's launch shows that North Korea is preparing the ground for a nuclear test.N Korea missile tests: What does Kim Jong-un want?What missiles does North Korea have?North Korea tests banned intercontinental missile The missile launch is the fifth carried out by Pyongyang in a week. On Saturday, two rockets came down in waters outside Japan's exclusive economic zone. Many of North Korea's missile tests are conducted on a high, lofted flight path - reaching a high altitude, avoiding flights over its neighbours.But firing over or past Japan allows North Korean scientists to test missiles under circumstances "that are more representative of the conditions they'd endure in real-world use", analyst Ankit Panda told news agency Reuters.These actions have contributed to enduring tensions between North Korea and Japan, rooted in Japan's colonisation of Korea from 1910 to 1945 and the North's abduction of Japanese citizens in the past.Earlier this month, North Korea passed a law declaring itself to be a nuclear weapons state, with leader Kim Jong-un ruling out the possibility of talks on denuclearisation. Pyongyang conducted six nuclear tests between 2006 and 2017, incurring widespread sanctions. The East Asian state regularly defies the ban on nuclear and missile tests, saying it needs to bolster its defences.Additional reporting by Nathan Williams. </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="BBC News, author unspecified"><Text>North Korea has fired a missile over Japan, which travelled about 4,500km (2,800 miles) before falling into the Pacific Ocean.It has been conducting regular missile tests as part of its weapons programme, but this is the first launch over Japan since 2017.North Korea has carried out more than 30 missile tests this year - using some with a long enough range to reach the US. These include ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and hypersonic missiles.Hypersonic missiles fly at several times the speed of sound and at low altitude, to escape radar detection. The latest missile tested over Japan is thought to be an intermediate-range Hwasong-12, which has a range of 4,500km - far enough to hit the US island of Guam from North Korea."North Korea has been testing missiles with longer and longer ranges," says Joseph Byrne, research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute."This is the longest-range missile it's ever fired over Japan. It could be the precursor to it testing another nuclear warhead, which has been predicted for some time." North Korea has also been testing the Hwasong-14 ballistic missile.This has a range of 8,000km - although some studies have suggested it could travel as far as 10,000km, making it capable of reaching New York.It is the first of North Korea's intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). The Hwasong-15 missile is believed to have a range of 13,000km, putting all of the continental US in its sights.In October 2020, North Korea unveiled the latest of its ballistic missiles - the Hwasong-17. It is believed to have a range of 15,000km or more.It could possibly carry three or four warheads, rather than only one - making it harder for a nation to defend itself.The unveiling of the new missiles appeared to be a message to the Biden administration of the North's growing military prowess, say experts.In March 2021, it carried out a launch of what it called a "new-type tactical guided projectile", which it said was able to carry a payload of 2.5 tons - so capable of in theory of carrying a nuclear warhead. Analysts at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies told Reuters that it appeared to be "an improved variant" of a previously tested missile, the KN-23. The last time North Korea tested a nuclear bomb was in 2017. The explosion at its Punggye-ri test site had a force, or "yield", of between 100-370 kilotons. A 100 kiloton bomb is six times more powerful than the one the US dropped on Hiroshima in 1945.North Korea claimed this was its first thermonuclear device - the most powerful of all types of atomic weapon.However, North Korea may now be aiming to test a smaller type of nuclear warhead with similar explosive force, according to Mr Byrne. "It seems they are now testing a new capability - a miniaturised warhead that can be fitted onto a range of missiles, including short-range missiles" he says. Six underground tests have previously been carried out at Punggye-ri. However, in 2018 North Korea said it would shut the site down, because it had "verified" its nuclear capabilities.Some of the tunnels into the site were subsequently blown up in the presence of foreign journalists. However, North Korea did not invite international experts to verify if it had been put beyond use.Satellite images released earlier this year suggest work to renovate Punggye-ri had started.Any future nuclear testing at the site would breach resolutions from the United Nations Security Council.In 2018, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un made a promise to then-US president Donald Trump that North Korea would destroy all its nuclear material enrichment facilities.However, the UN's atomic agency says satellite images suggest that North Korea had restarted the reactor which makes its weapons-grade plutonium.The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has also said that North Korea's nuclear programme is going "full steam ahead," with work on plutonium separation, uranium enrichment and other activities.Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questions</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Nadine  Yousif"><Text>Former US President Donald Trump nearly fired his daughter and routinely flushed documents down the toilet.These explosive details and more are revealed in New York Times journalist Maggie Haberman's highly-anticipated book Confidence Man, which is released on Tuesday. The book follows Mr Trump from his time as a New York businessman to his life after the presidency. It draws from interviews with more than 200 sources, including former aides as well as three interviews with Mr Trump himself. The former president has attacked Haberman, writing on his social media platform that the book contains "many made up stories with zero fact checking".Here are eight of Confidence Man's biggest revelations:At a meeting with then Chief of Staff John Kelly and then White House counsel Don McGahn, Haberman writes that Mr Trump was close to tweeting that his daughter, Ivanka, and son-in-law Jared Kushner - both senior White House aides - were leaving their positions. He was stopped by Mr Kelly, who advised him to speak with Ivanka and Mr Kushner first before sending the tweet. Mr Trump never spoke with them, and they both remained White House aides until the end of his presidency. The book also reveals that Mr Trump frequently talked down on his son-in-law, and once commented that Mr Kushner "sounds like a child" after hearing a public speech he gave in 2017. Mr Trump has denied ever wanting to fire Ivanka and her husband. "Pure fiction. Never even crossed my mind," he said.Haberman writes that Mr Trump raised the prospect of bombing Mexican drug labs several times - a suggestion that stunned former US Defence Secretary Mark Esper. The idea stemmed from a conversation that Mr Trump had with Brett Giroir, a public health officer and an admiral with the US Public Health Service Commissioned Corps.Mr Giroir walked into the Oval Office wearing a dress uniform - as is customary for public health officers in the corps - and said to Mr Trump that facilities producing illegal drugs in Mexico should be handled by putting "a lead to target" to stop illicit substances from coming over the border.Mistaking Mr Giroir for a military officer, Mr Trump then suggested bombing the drug facilities. In response, the White House asked Mr Giroir to stop wearing his uniform. When Mr Trump fell ill with Covid-19 in October 2020, his condition at the White House was worsening and he was fearful of dying.  At one point, his deputy chief of staff, Tony Ornato, warned the president that if his health deteriorated further he would have to set in motion procedures to ensure the continuity of government. This fear existed despite several attempts by Mr Trump to minimize the pandemic, as he worried the virus was negatively impacting his image and political motivations. Haberman writes that he asked aides around him to take off their masks, and that he advised then New York governor Andrew Cuomo to not talk about the virus on TV. "Don't make such a big deal out of this," Mr Trump said to Mr Cuomo, according to the book. "You're going to make it a problem."Haberman's book details several encounters between Mr Trump and world leaders. For instance, in his first meeting with then UK Prime Minister Theresa May, Mr Trump spoke about abortion, saying "some people are pro-life, some people are pro-choice. Imagine if some animals with tattoos raped your daughter and she got pregnant?"He then changed the subject in a conversation on Northern Ireland to discuss how to block an offshore wind project from being set up near his property. When it became apparent that Mr Trump was losing the 2020 election to US President Joe Biden, he called former New York City mayor and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani."Okay, Rudy, you're in charge. Go wild, do anything you want. I don't care," Mr Trump said, after other lawyers refused to go as far as he has requested in his bid to overturn the election results. "My lawyers are terrible," he said to Mr Giuliani, according to the book. He also frequently berated White House counsel Pat Cipollone. The book reveals that at the time, Mr Trump was enamoured with conspiracy theories and sought out lawyers that his own advisers felt were deluded.On a plane while campaigning in 2016, Mr Trump was asked by his campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and his press secretary Hope Hicks to address his refusal to release his tax returns - an issue they saw as a problem for Mr Trump's White House bid.Haberman writes that Mr Trump responded by leaning back before snapping to a sudden thought: "Well, you know my taxes are under audit, I always get audited," he said. "So what I mean is, well I could just say, 'I'll release them when I'm no longer under audit. 'Cause I'll never not be under audit." Since Richard Nixon, every US president has voluntarily released their tax returns. A 2020 New York Times investigation has since revealed that Mr Trump paid $750 (£662) in federal income taxes the year he became president. When Mr Trump was in office, White House staff periodically discovered that the toilet was clogged with printed paper and believed he had flushed documents.He also allegedly tore up documents, which contravenes the Presidential Records Act - a law that says documents created or received by a president are the property of the US government and are to be handled by the US National Archives once the presidency ends.The details are revealed amid wider allegations of missing documents from Mr Trump's White House levelled by the National Archives. Mr Trump also faces a criminal investigation by the Department of Justice for keeping government records at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida after leaving office.At a congressional meeting shortly after his 2017 inauguration, Haberman writes that Mr Trump turned to a racially diverse group of Democratic staffers and asked them to fetch canapes, mistaking them for waiters.The book details that Mr Trump made the remarks to staffers for Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Nancy Pelosi.

I have no idea what to expect when we get there - how cold it will be, will we have to dig our way through the snow to the post office?" Ms Hilton, from Bo'ness, near Falkirk in Scotland, said."I'm a conservation biologist, so personally I can't wait to see the penguins and other wildlife like seabirds and whales."The four women were among 6,000 people who expressed an interest in the roles, which were advertised by the UK Antarctic Heritage Trust (UKAHT) charity.Newly appointed postmaster Ms Ballantyne, from Lincolnshire, has just completed a masters in earth science at Oxford University.The 23-year-old will deal by hand with approximately 80,000 cards, which are mailed each year from the site to more than 100 countries.Ms Bruzzone will be base leader, managing the team and coordinating all ship visits to the island.The scientist, who has already spent three months in the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard on an Arctic expedition, described the opportunity as a "lifelong dream".The women will be joined for the first 10 weeks by 42-year-old Vicky Inglis, from Aberdeenshire, who was a UKAHT general assistant in the 2019/20 season.

It takes less than five minutes to get there, but the last 50 metres must be covered on foot through thick, spiky vegetation, some of it chest-high.  The two men flee as the unit approaches, leaving behind them the half-prepared boat, the fuel and motor, and two sacks of life-jackets."The vegetation works against us," General Frantz Tavart told me. "The smugglers know this and stash the boats here on purpose."The UK drones are valuable, he says, because they spot even well-hidden sites like this one."The drone caught this," he said. "The [surveillance] plane passed over beforehand and didn't spot it, because it was hidden by the trees."This 160km stretch of coastline has sucked in resources, year after year. France and the UK have invested in more patrols, better technology and different kinds of vehicles. And still the numbers crossing the Channel keep growing.Britain's new home secretary, Suella Braverman, will give a speech at the Conservative's party conference later where she's expected to restate her determination to crack down on the arrivals.French patrols say they're stopping around half of all crossing attempts, but more than 30,000 people have still made it to the UK so far this year.And it's not just migrants who are finding this route increasingly attractive. New smuggling networks have been reported this summer too.A senior French official with good knowledge of the situation told us that dedicated Albanian smuggling networks are now operating across the Channel, separately from the main Kurdish and Iraqi networks."[The Albanian networks] are more efficient than the others," he told us. "40% of those we intercept on this side of the Channel are Albanian; but they make up 60% of those who arrive on the other side.""Our hypothesis is that they're a lot more experienced than the others in terms of criminal activity, and more used to organising themselves and avoiding the police. We find the prices are higher for Albanian networks than for the others."General Tavart says he can't confirm whether the new Albanian smuggling routes are being run by established criminal groups, perhaps based in the UK, but he says it would make sense."With the price of a crossing around 4,000 euros (£3,482), and around 40 people in one boat, do the maths," he said.  "It's extremely lucrative, even more so than drug trafficking, and the criminal charges are lighter."Some have suggested that shortages in the labour market post-Brexit are adding to the 'pull-factors' attracting both smugglers and their clients.Larger numbers of Albanians have been seen at the main migrant camp in Dunkerque, but most seem to stay in hotels around the area, or in Paris or Brussels.At one hotel in Dunkerque, the landlady confirmed she now had a large number of Albanian clients passing through.  The owner of a bar across the street from the station said that on some days half his customers are Albanian."I wonder if there's anyone left in Albania," he said, "seeing how many of them are coming through here."The rise in migrants crossing the Channel, and the appearance of new smuggling networks, seems to challenge the government's strategy of deterrence.For months, the UK government has been promising to send some of those who arrive in small boats to Rwanda, where their asylum claims will be processed, and where they will be expected to settle if their claim is successful.On the road outside Calais, in the small hours of the morning, we met 17-year-old Sikunder and his friends, wrapped in survival blankets that glinted like pieces of silver in the dark.They are all from Afghanistan, they said, and had just been rescued from a sinking boat by the French police.I asked Sikunder whether he was aware that the UK might send him to Rwanda."I have heard about it," he replied, "but some of my relatives in the UK told us the plan was finished, and we can come to the UK."It was his second attempt at crossing; he's determined it won't be his last.The UK government is currently fighting a court battle over the legality of its Rwanda policy. In the camps around Calais, almost everyone is aware of the risk, and almost everyone finds a way to rationalise it away.Biniam is a softly-spoken 28-year-old man from the Tigray region in Ethiopia. In fluent English, he told me he had a Masters degree in manufacturing, and that he wanted to claim asylum in the UK because he had seen how the British government had spoken out strongly against the violent conflict in Tigray."The UK understands the situation in my country," he told me. "So that's why I will go."I ask him how afraid he is of being sent to Rwanda."100% afraid," he said. "If they return me to Africa, it will be easy for the government of Ethiopia to take me."More than one person here told me how the change of prime minister would mean the policy would be scrapped.There's little sign of that UK Prime Minister Liz Truss has so far been very supportive of it.Jess Sharman of Care4Calais says people are risking their lives to get to the UK, because they can't claim asylum while in France, and can't cross the Channel via official routes."They shouldn't be here, and it's only because of government policies that they are," she said. "And that could change overnight if Liz Truss could make it safe and legal for them to [claim asylum]."A lot can change overnight here in Calais.Camps are systematically destroyed by police units; violent conflicts erupt between smuggling gangs; security patrols race migrants for miles along the scrubby coastline; and - very often - as dawn breaks, another boatload of people from around the world end up on Britain's shores.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Rajini Vaidyanathan"><Text>The United Nations has issued a new appeal for more than $800m (£700m) for flood-hit Pakistan. The funds, a five-fold increase on the previous request, would help families and children battle malnutrition and infection in what is now a public health emergency. It comes as the country struggles to cope after more than 2,000 hospitals and health centres were damaged or destroyed in recent floods, which left almost 1,700 people dead. Doctors like Ammara Gohar are on the front lines of the crisis as the UN launches a fresh appeal for the world to send more aid."It's very difficult for us. We attended to patients during Covid, but this is tougher because it involves environmental hazards," says Dr Ammara, a gynaecologist four years into her medical career.  She is working out of a school in rural Sindh province, the area worst affected in the floods, which has temporarily become the headquarters for the district health office after it was submerged. Here, Dr Ammara and her team load a van with boxes of medical supplies - everything from bandages to malaria tablets, hepatitis test kits to oral rehydration salts."We're taking this to people who've been completely cut off since the floods," she explains. Pakistan flood survivors battle rising tide of diseasePakistan floods: Images show huge scale of devastationWith around 75% of districts in Sindh province still flooded - and many roads underwater -  the only way people in isolated communities can access medical help is if it travels to them.So after an hour's drive, we reach the banks of a huge lake which a few months ago was fertile land that fed people in this area. Having swallowed their crops, it's now stagnant water where mosquitoes multiply, and a breeding ground for disease.Across the vast expanse live villagers who've been stranded for weeks."These people cannot survive without support in disaster-hit areas," Dr Ammara tells us.Her team of government doctors take to wooden boats to reach them, their efforts supported by the United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef). "This is a medical crisis," Unicef's Aadarsh Laghari tells us, as the medical team headed to a village needing help. "Access is one of the biggest problems - every day the medical needs of these communities are rising."In the first three weeks of September alone, more than 140,000 cases of malaria were reported in Sindh, health officials say. But with many people in far-flung areas unable to get tested, it's likely the true scale is much higher.And that's why mobile medical units are so urgently needed.After we reach the shore, the team set up a health camp under the shade of a tree on the edge of the village, where cows had earlier been taking shelter from the sun.A banner is hung from the branches to advertise the clinic; supplies which had been carried here by land and by water, are now being unpacked and laid out on plastic tables.As a tannoy announces the arrival of the medical staff, a steady stream of villagers arrive, many of them women carrying young children. The village of Noor Shah was already impoverished but the floods have pushed people right to the edge.As patients line up, a nurse measures the arm of baby Saima, with Dr Ammara looking on. The tape wound around her tiny arm moves to the red area of the scale, indicating that Saima is perilously thin."There are so many people like this baby," Dr Ammara says. "At just nine months old she's severely malnourished."Many families are sleeping in the open in flimsy tents next to homes which were washed away, or have crumbled to rock.Marooned for weeks, they're finally getting much needed medical help - but many say they're still waiting to get food and access to clean water to drink and wash with.At another village close by, three-year-old Gulbahar is examined by Dr Ammara. He has scabs on his face and body and is weak -  the result, Dr Ammara says, of drinking and washing with contaminated water.The UN says a lack of toilets has left people with no choice but to defecate in the same water, leading to outbreaks of illnesses. "Because of the floods we are seeing so many young children with these skin infections," Dr Ammara says, opening Gulbahar's mouth to examine his diseased gums.She hands his mother some medicines, but concedes her supplies will soon run out.While diseases spike, Pakistan's already overwhelmed healthcare system lacks the resources to help all those who need treatment. Boats are also in short supply, as are doctors - meaning efforts like this remain limited.Many people we met in these remote communities blame the government for not doing enough. Dr Azra Afzal Pechuho, the Sindh health minister, said: "It's like fighting a war which has no end to it. Until the water recedes, which is going to take another two, three months, we will still be seeing a lot of health issues."She has called for doctors to volunteer extra hours. "Ten days, three days, four days - whatever they feel they can give to the flood-affected areas," she told the BBC.Dr Ammara and her team are already working around the clock.  Without the camps, Dr Ammara fears people won't be able to survive."It hurts, it really hurts, I can't see people like this," she says. "I feel bad that we can't do more."</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Nduka Orjinmo"><Text>Jane Toku sheds no tears as she recalls the moment when she saw the smouldering remains of her son's corpse on the morning he and three of his friends were lynched 10 years ago.The four students had run into a local vigilante group at dawn in Aluu, a community behind the University of Port Harcourt in southern Nigeria's oil capital.There had been a spate of robberies in the area and at that time of the morning, people became suspicions. Accused of being petty thieves, the four - Llody Toku, Ugonna Obuzor, Chiadika Biringa and Tekena Elkanah - were given a mock trial and found guilty.Their punishment was handed out immediately: they were stripped, marched around the community, brutally beaten and set alight by the mob as thousands watched and filmed."When I arrived, I forced my way through the crowd and knelt before my son's corpse."His friend Tekena was barely breathing, I watched his chest heave with his last breaths," Mrs Toku said.Such mob killings are not uncommon in Nigeria but this was the first to go viral on social media, causing widespread outrage, protests and debates about the country's judicial system, and questions about a society where people resort to such levels of violence."One is tired and sick of coming here to lament after these dastardly acts," a lawmaker said at the time when the incident was discussed at the National Assembly."It is important for 'jungle justice' to be stopped - it is bad," said radio host Yaw, as celebrities condemned the incident.But despite the shock and anger over the killing of the students, now known as the Aluu Four, and the sentencing of three men including one police officer, for their roles in the lynching, mob attacks continue to happen in Nigeria. There have been 391 mob killings in Nigeria since 2019, according to SBM Intelligence, a Lagos-based think-tank, with at least five this year alone. That begs the question why the outrage over the killing of the Aluu Four didn't lead to a national reckoning over lynchings."The failure of the criminal justice system is one very important reason for this," said Dr Agwanwo Destiny, a criminologist at the sociology department of the University of Port Harcourt.He pointed to instances where criminal suspects handed over to the police were released without investigation and ended up seeking revenge on those who had given them up."Such incidents erode trust in the judicial system, so when people are alleged to have committed a crime, people are quick to pass judgement and vent their frustrations," Dr Destiny said.It is an argument also made by activist Annkio Briggs, who led demonstrations in Port Harcourt to demand justice for the students and their families, because she "couldn't trust the system to do what was right," she told the BBC.Perpetrators of mob killings in Nigeria are rarely arrested and prosecuted.Two suspects arrested in May after the lynching of a Christian student on allegations of blasphemy in Sokoto have still not been brought to trial, while the police said the main culprits are still at large.It was one of four reported cases of mob killing in that month alone:Two men were burnt to death by a mob in the Ijesha area of Lagos over alleged theft of mobile phonesOne man was murdered in Lugbe, Abuja on allegations of blasphemyCommercial motorcyclists lynched a sound engineer identified as David Imoh in the Lekki area of Lagos.Suspects have been charged in all cases, the police said. But it might be years before there are any verdicts because of the slow pace of justice in Nigeria.Two years ago, Nigeria's anti-corruption agency, the ICPC, said the judiciary was the most corrupt arm of government in the country. It said that more than nine billion naira ($21m; £19m) was offered and paid as bribes in the sector. Such reports indicating that justice is for sale to the highest bidder erode trust in the system, said Dr Destiny.It has never been determined what the four students were doing when they were stopped by the vigilante group in Aluu.One version said they were thieves, another said they were members of a violent gang but neither allegation was proved in court."He was not a perfect child but he was humble and he was our confidant."He was close to us because we had our second child 11 years after him," Mrs Toku said of her son.The four students, best friends, were in their late teens and early 20s and came from middle-class homes.Ugonna, 18, and his friend Lloyd, 19 - known as Tipsy and Big L - were budding musicians in Port Harcourt's rap scene.One of their three unreleased songs Love In The City could almost be a prophesy of what befell them.Growing up in the city like PH where Ra was made to sing rightWe embrace the street life cosThere's no love in the heart of the cityHow can the seeds grow when the garden is wearyIt used to be very cool but the oil crude brought violence"There can be no justification, no reason why anybody should die like that," said their friend Gloria During, who lived in the same Hilton hostel in Aluu as both musicians.Aluu is popular for its private apartments that are rented by students who can't find accommodation at the university's insufficient hostels.At the time it was a small village with many undeveloped plots and a population that were mostly farmers. Today, Port Harcourt's sprawling metropolis has caught up with the fringes of Aluu - most of the land has been built on by Pentecostal churches and more hostels have sprung up.But in the centre of the community remains two barren plots, the playground where the students were first held and death pronounced on them, and the burrow-pit, several hundred yards away, where they were marched to, beaten and killed.Despite the nationwide shock when the incident happened, time has allowed most of Nigeria to move on.But for a mother, time is a keen reminder of the loss of a beloved first son with a bright future ahead of him. "He had a bright career in music, he would have gone far by now," Mrs Toku said. </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="BBC News, author unspecified"><Text>Celebrated Indian filmmaker Mani Ratnam's new film Ponniyin Selvan:1, a Tamil-language epic period drama, has taken the box office by storm. Sudha G Tilak on what makes the film a hit.Ponniyin Selvan, based on one of India's greatest emperors, is widely considered by many to be the finest novel ever written in Tamil.It was the name conferred by the loyal subjects on Rajaraja Chola - whose name means 'king of kings' -  of the Chola dynasty, which ruled Tamil land from 9th Century to 13th Century.Rajaraja was not the first of the Chola dynasty but he took their empire to its zenith - from a relatively small kingdom to the dominant empire in India. Their political influence extended across Sri Lanka, Maldives, Sumatra, parts of Thailand and Malaysia, and they had diplomatic ties with China.Rajaraja Chola: Cults of the ImaginationVenice film award for director Mani RatnamHistorian Sunil Khilnani wrote that Rajaraja "pulled off something that no Indian ruler before him seems to have done: he'd commandeered trading boats, timber sailed craft and launched maritime expeditions, bringing far flung wealth back home". The star-studded film, which cost $70m (£62m) to make, revolves around Ponniyin Selvan's ascendency to the throne as his father, the ailing king, retreats from royal duties. The kingdom is embroiled in palace intrigues and an impending coup. Rival members of the royal clan plot to usurp the throne, and enemy kings conspire assassinations. Leading the stratagem is a powerful and enigmatic noblewoman Nandini (played by Bollywood star Aishwarya Rai Bachchan) on a vengeful path to destroy her former lover and the prince-in-waiting (played by award-winning actor Vikram). Her rival is princess Kundavai (played by leading Tamil actress Trisha) who wants to defeat the plots, protect her brothers, and see that her rightful sibling ascends the throne. Row over Bollywood director in Indian Big BrotherActor Karthi plays the part of the colourful Vandiyathevan, a swashbuckling warrior and loyal friend of the princes. He is a musketeer-like figure, charming women, averting disasters, and thwarting plots with clever antics.  Ponniyin Selvan is a fictional literary record of the glory of the Cholas, whose cultural contribution remains visible in modern-day Tamil Nadu. The king's imprint can be seen in the stunning sculptures and inscriptions in a towering granite temple in the city of Thanjavur, which was the seat of the Cholas. The story of Ponniyin Selvan was serialised in Kalki, a Tamil magazine, by writer and journalist Kalki Krishnamurthy in 1955. The sprawling historical fiction, running to nearly 2,000 pages, has been published in several editions and translated into English. Comic books for children based on the novel and theatre productions have kept the epic alive in popular imagination."The novel has a cult following across generations of Tamils. It will be interesting to see how a 21st-Century audience reared on Game of Thrones and homegrown fantasy movies like Baahubali responds to this film based on 10th Century dynastic Tamil politics, royal intrigue, and chicanery," says Chennai-based film scholar Pritam Chakravarthy.Director Mani Ratnam, described as "India's top pop-film auteur", said in an interview that he wanted Ponniyin Selvan to be an "immersive experience" for the audience.Why Bollywood is struggling to beat pandemic bluesThe south Indian films winning on Bollywood's turfScenes of bloody battles and warring soldiers, horseback and elephant chases and dances with actors in regalia captivate audiences. A beachfront invasion, the king battling the savage seas and the sinking of a ship are a nod to the maritime escapades of the Cholas. The dialogue is in medieval Tamil, but written to be accessible to a contemporary audience.  The film's music, a blend of Western chords, folk drum beats, monkey chants and Sufi strains is led by Oscar-winning composer AR Rahman.Critics have appreciated Mani Ratnam for his deft adaptation of a five-part novel into two parts - the second part is due for release next year. Despite the pandemic, the director managed to wrap up filming both the parts of the movie, each running to nearly two-and-a-half hours, in 150 days.Ponniyin Selvan opened to a thunderous reception at the weekend. Cinema halls in the southern city of Chennai saw people queue up for special shows that opened after midnight to accommodate the huge volume of ticket sales. Scenes of fans dancing to folk drumbeats outside cinema halls celebrating the release of the movie were seen across Tamil Nadu.'Struggling' Bollywood's online hate problemThe frenzy over the film has spilled over with fans forming groups to travel across the former kingdoms and villages across Tamil Nadu ruled by the Cholas as mentioned in the novel. The first part ends with a cliff-hanger.

The former officer, aged 34, was sacked in June for drug use, police said.A teacher who survived told Thailand's Thairath TV that the attacker used to drop off his child at the nursery and had seemed polite. A motive remains unclear.At least 22 children were among the dead in the mass killing in the town of Utthai Sawan. Some victims aged as young as two were attacked as they slept. A dozen people who were injured have been taken to Nong Bua Lamphu district hospital.Follow our live coverage"The shooter came in around lunchtime and shot four or five officials at the childcare centre first," a local official, Jidapa Boonsom, who was working nearby, told Reuters news agency. One of them was a teacher who was eight months pregnant."At first people thought it was fireworks," she said, adding that the man then forced entry to a locked room where children were sleeping.'It's shocking' - witnesses describe nursery attack horrorVideos shared on social media appear to show the tears and distress of parents and relatives of those killed, as they gathered at a shelter outside the centre.Police officers arriving after the attack were confronted with horrific scenes, the bodies of adults and children, some of them very young, lying inside and outside the building. Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha described the incident as "a shocking event".Police named the attacker as Panya Kamrab, a local man who had been a police lieutenant colonel before he was dismissed last year for drug use. He is understood to have appeared in court on Thursday on charges related to the use and possible sale of methamphetamine. The verdict was scheduled to be delivered on Friday.Armed with a shotgun, a pistol and a knife, he stormed the nursery at about 12:30 local time (05:30 GMT). The details of what followed are still emerging, but after the killing spree the attacker fled the scene in a white four-door Toyota pick-up truck with Bangkok registration plates, according to police, who launched a search for him and warned locals to keep indoors for their own safety. Eyewitnesses were quoted saying the attacker had driven into bystanders and opened fire at some of them, injuring several people as he made his escape.The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterPolice say Kamrab returned home, killing his wife and son before taking his own life.Mass shootings in Thailand are rare, although gun ownership rates are relatively high for the region. Illegal weapons are also common in the south-east Asian country, according to the Reuters news agency.

Her uncle was also seen on TV speaking against the unrest, as someone seems to whisper to him: "Say it, you scumbag!"The source told BBC Persian that these were both "forced confessions" that came "after intense interrogations and being threatened that other family members would be killed".Atash and Nika's uncle, Mohsen, were detained by authorities after Atash posted messages online about her niece's death and spoke to the media. The televised statements were recorded before they were released, according to the source.The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterAtash told BBC Persian prior to her arrest on Sunday that the Revolutionary Guards had told her that Nika was in their custody for five days and then handed over to prison authorities.The judiciary has said that on the night she disappeared Nika went into a building where eight constructions workers were present, and that she was found dead in the yard outside the next morning.Tehran judiciary official Mohammad Shahriari was cited by state media as saying on Wednesday that a post-mortem showed Nika suffered "multiple fractures... in the pelvis, head, upper and lower limbs, arms and legs, which indicate that the person was thrown from a height".He declared that this proved her death was nothing to do with the protests. However, a death certificate issued by a cemetery in the capital, which was obtained by BBC Persian, states that she died after suffering "multiple injuries caused by blows with a hard object".Nika's Instagram and Telegram accounts were also deleted after she went missing, according to Atash. Iranian security forces are known to demand that detainees give them access to the social media accounts so that the accounts or certain posts can be deleted.Wednesday night's state TV report also featured footage in which Atash was seen confirming that her niece's body was found outside the building mentioned by the judiciary, even though that contradicted previous statements made by her and other members of the family.The family have said they located Nika's body at the mortuary of a detention centre 10 days after she went missing, and that they were only allowed by officials to see her face for a few seconds in order to identify her. Atash said before she was detained that she did not go to the mortuary.Nika's family transferred her body to her father's hometown of Khorramabad, in the west of the country, on Sunday - on what would have been her 17th birthday.A source close to them told BBC Persian that the family agreed, under duress from authorities, not to hold a public funeral. But, the source said, security forces then "stole" Nika's body from Khorramabad and secretly buried it in the village of Veysian, about 40km (25 miles) away.Hundreds of protesters later gathered in Khorramabad's cemetery and chanted slogans against the government, including "death to the dictator" - a reference to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei.Nika is not the only young female protester to have been killed during the unrest that erupted last month following the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman who was detained by the morality police for allegedly violating the Islamic Republic's strict hijab law.The family of Hadis Najafi, 22, have said that she was shot dead by security forces while protesting in the city of Karaj, west of Tehran, on 21 September. Officials allegedly asked her father to say that she died of a heart attack.Another 16-year-old girl, Sarina Esmailzadeh, died after being severely beaten on the head with batons by security forces during protests in Karaj on 23 September, Amnesty International cited a source as saying. The source also told the human rights group that security and intelligence agents had harassed the girl's family to coerce them into silence.  Several videos made by Sarina before her death have now been posted on social media. In one recorded after finishing some school exams, she says: "Nothing feels better than freedom."  </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Paul Kirby"><Text>At least 17 people have died and another 15 people are missing after a migrant boat sank off the Greek island of Lesbos on Wednesday night.The Greek coastguard said the dinghy had left the Turkish coast carrying 40 people in very high winds.Elsewhere in Greece dozens of migrants were rescued when their boat hit rocks near the southern island of Kythira.Coastguard video showed a group of people trapped beneath a cliff as rescuers pulled them to safety.Both boats went down within hours of each other on Wednesday night and early on Thursday, hundreds of kilometres apart.Volunteers joined rescue officials at the top of the cliff face on Kythira, an island off the Peloponnese region of southern Greece. The migrant boat broke up close to the island's eastern harbour at Diakofti in winds of up to 70km/h (45mph) and according to Greek reports one of those on board raised the alarm when it got into trouble."We could see the boat smashing against the rocks and people climbing up those rocks to try and save themselves," local resident Martha Stathaki told the Associated Press news agency. Eighty of the 95 people on board are said to have been rescued on the Kythira coast. Greek reports say they had originally come from Iran, Afghanistan and Iraq and included 55 men and 18 children.Mayor Stratos Harhalakis said the boat had arrived at the worst possible point on Kythira as a gale-force winds pushed  it on to treacherous rocks. He described seeing five people drown as they were swept away. Their small boat was big enough for 15 to 20 people, rather than almost 100, he said. Meanwhile, on Lesbos, authorities said the bodies of 16 young women of African origin and a young boy had been recovered after their boat went down near Thermi. Ten women were rescued and taken to the local hospital at Mytilini. Lesbos was also hit by powerful winds as the coastguard searched for survivors.Local officials said the boat had left the Turkish port of Ayvali and Greek Migration Minister Notis Mitarachi called on Turkey to take "immediate action" to put an end to irregular migrant crossings in harsh weather. "Already today many lives lost in the Aegean, people are drowning in unseaworthy vessels. EU must act," he tweeted.While Lesbos is a short distance from the coast of western Turkey, Kythira lies some 400km (250km) west of Turkey's coastline on the Aegean Sea and is on what has become known as the smugglers' "Calabrian" route, named after their destination in southern Italy.Last month two migrant boats landed on Kythira carrying almost 100 people, mainly from Afghanistan. More and more crossings are being made from Turkey to the Italian coast, bypassing Greece.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Helen Bushby and Ian Youngs"><Text>French writer Annie Ernaux has won the Nobel Prize in Literature, for what the panel said was an "uncompromising" 50-year body of work exploring "a life marked by great disparities regarding gender, language and class".The prestigious accolade is awarded by the Swedish Academy and is worth 10 million Swedish kronor (£807,000).She said it was "a great honour".Professor Carl-Henrik Heldin, chair of the committee, said the 82-year-old's work was "admirable and enduring".He said she used "courage and clinical acuity" to tell semi-autobiographical stories that uncover "the contradictions of social experience [and] describe shame, humiliation, jealousy or the inability to see who you are".The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterHer books, including A Man's Place and A Woman's Story, are considered to be contemporary classics in France.Ernaux is the first French woman to win the literature prize, and told Swedish broadcaster SVT it was "a responsibility"."I was very surprised... I never thought it would be on my landscape as a writer," she said. "It is a great responsibility... to testify, not necessarily in terms of my writing, but to testify with accuracy and justice in relation to the world."Jacques Testard, from Fitzcarraldo Editions which publishes English translations of her work, told BBC World Service Radio's Newshour she is an "exceptional and unique" writer. "She's a very important feminist writer, I would say, also a very important working class writer - both of those themes I think very clearly visible in her work," he explained. Dr Ruth Cruickshank, who specialises in contemporary French fiction at Royal Holloway, University of London, said: "When a woman wins the Nobel Prize for Literature it is always great news. Thirteen dead and two living white French men have been Nobel laureates since 1901."She explores memories of life experiences - both extraordinary and relatable - a backstreet abortion; failed affairs whether with a lover in Russia or a man 30 years younger; the death of her parents; breast cancer."Ernaux was born in 1940 in Normandy, where the setting for her early life was "poor but ambitious", Prof Heldin said.Her parents ran a café and grocery shop, and when she encountered girls from middle-class backgrounds, she experienced the "shame of her working-class parents and milieu for the first time," according to her website.That would later feed into her novels. Her official biography said the main themes of her work were "the body and sexuality; intimate relationships; social inequality and the experience of changing class through education; time and memory; and the overarching question of how to write these life experiences".Ernaux studied literature, having worked as an au pair in London, and was married with two children and teaching in a French secondary school when her first book was published in 1974.Cleaned Out was a fictionalised account of the illegal abortion she had in 1964, which she kept secret from her family.She revisited that trauma 25 years later for the book Happening, in which she "sifts through her memories and her journal entries dating from those days". It was turned into a film that won the top prize at last year's Venice Film Festival.Prof Heldin added: "Annie Ernaux manifestly believes in the liberating force of writing. Her work is uncompromising and written in plain language, scraped clean."The writer got divorced in the early 1980s, and in 2000 she retired from teaching to devote herself to writing.Another of Ernaux's books, The Years, won the Prix Renaudot in France in 2008 and the Premio Strega in Italy in 2016, while a year later she won the Marguerite Yourcenar Prize for her life's work.In 2019, The Years went on to be shortlisted for the Man Booker International Prize, whose judges called it a "genre-bending masterpiece".Booker said at the time that "autobiography is given a new form, at once subjective and impersonal, private and collective".The New Yorker wrote in 2020 that over her 20 books, "she has been devoted to a single task: the excavation of her own life".The Nobel Prizes, awarded since 1901, recognise achievement in literature, science, peace and latterly economics. Last year's literary prize was won by Tanzanian novelist Abdulrazak Gurnah.Other winners have included novelists such as Ernest Hemingway, Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Toni Morrison, plus poets such as Louise Gluck, Pablo Neruda, Joseph Brodsky and Rabindranath Tagore, and playwrights including Harold Pinter and Eugene O'Neill.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Jessica Parker"><Text>The leaders of more than 40 European countries are having talks in Prague, at a historic first meeting of a new political forum of nations.As he arrived, France's Emmanuel Macron spoke of building a "common strategy" in response to Russia's war in Ukraine.UK Prime Minister Liz Truss joined leaders from the EU, Turkey, Norway and the Balkans, as Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky spoke via video link.Germany's chancellor said the gathering was a great innovation.The summit, billed as a European Political Community beyond the EU, has been championed by Emmanuel Macron, who told reporters on Thursday it sent a "message of unity". But there is scepticism, even within the EU, about the new forum. Ahead of the meeting, Ms Truss made clear it was "not an EU construct or an EU alternative". Nevertheless, her decision to take part could mark a new phase in the UK's post-Brexit relations with Europe. The leaders were discussing energy, migration and security, with a particular focus on the war in Ukraine. Officials said Ms Truss spoke of the need for stronger, more resilient economies and energy supplies, while stressing the need for freedom to succeed.Ukraine's president told the summit: "You and I are now in a strong position to direct all the possible might of Europe to end the war and guarantee long-term peace for Ukraine, for Europe, for the world."EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said in a blog that in the wake of Russia's invasion, there was a need to "rethink and reform the wider European order, beyond the work of the EU and Nato", but he added that the summit would be no more than an initial exchange.As well as the UK, non-EU members Switzerland, Turkey, Norway, Iceland, Georgia, Azerbaijan and western Balkan countries are among those taking part in the first gathering of the EPC.Germany's Olaf Scholz pointed out that all the countries attending the summit knew that Russia's war was "a brutal violation of the security and peace order that we have had in Europe over recent decades".Critics see it as a vague regurgitation of old ideas and its exact role has yet to be made clear. When he proposed the idea this year, President Macron said it would "offer a platform for political co-ordination" for countries, both those in the EU and those not. Russia's invasion of Ukraine gave new impetus for co-operation among nations beyond the EU's 27 member states. What is the new European Political Community?Truss pledges billions to support Ukraine in 2023But the new EPC has no institutions or dedicated staff. That has led to questions about how any decisions would be implemented. So it's an unprecedented effort to bring leaders together from across the continent to discuss areas of shared interest. If it proves to be a success, it may continue to take place up to twice a year. If it's a failure, it could fizzle out.Ms Truss had been hostile to the EPC project, so what changed?Some observers point out it was never likely she would voice passionate enthusiasm for a French-led European meet-up while vying for the Tory leadership.But once in power, she appeared to warm to the idea, although Downing Street is reluctant to accept suggestions that Mr Macron won her over.It might prove to be a "modest" turning point in EU-UK relations, says the director of the Centre for European Reform, Charles Grant.While a row about post-Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland remains unresolved, talks are restarting this week."Neither side is trying to push that issue to the brink at the moment," says Mr Grant. "So this summit could be a sign of a modest rapprochement."The official line was that the PM was taking part because she wanted to "shore up" support for Ukraine and "galvanise" collective action on energy security and migration.Downing Street said Ms Truss would call on leaders to keep oil and gas interconnectors open this winter while taking part in talks on joint projects to develop new nuclear and offshore wind capacity.Another draw for the UK was the presence of Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan, as well as the participation of Norway, a key supplier of energy to the UK.The UK has been less keen to talk about security, with jitters that the EPC could be seen as somehow cutting across the Nato military alliance.If the EPC does prove short on solid outcomes, then expect it to be long on messages about support for Ukraine and condemnation of the Kremlin.But not all those attending are of one mind on the conflict."One of the measures of success will be, does it persuade Serbia, Azerbaijan and Turkey to lean a bit more to the West and less towards Russia?" says Mr Grant.Turkey has talked of a "balanced" approach to Russia and has not signed up to Western sanctions."When first proposed by Macron, the EPC was supposed to be a club with shared democratic values, but it's now more about making sure Europe as a whole isn't Russia's friend," says Mr Grant.A sign of the uncertainty about what the EPC is really for is that there have been far clearer messages about what it is not.It's not a substitute for Nato or the G7, we're told. It's not a slightly comfier "waiting room" for countries eager to join the EU. Nor it is a forum that will be dominated by EU institutions.That's despite invites having been issued by the president of the European Council, Charles Michel, while the meeting itself has been tacked on to the front of an EU summit.Brussels insists it has merely been facilitating the forum - it's not "the EU plus plus", insisted one senior official.The next EPC, in either six months or a year's time, is likely to be held in Moldova.If the project survives, the UK is currently fourth in line to host a summit. But British officials are keen to play it cool on the EPC, insisting they will walk away if it evolves in an undesirable direction.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="BBC News, author unspecified"><Text>Oscar-winning actor Kevin Spacey has gone on trial in New York over an allegation he sexually assaulted a boy 36 years ago.Mr Spacey is facing a civil lawsuit brought by Anthony Rapp, who says the actor inappropriately touched him at a party in 1986 when he was aged 14.Mr Spacey, 63, is separately facing five charges of sexual assault in the UK.The House of Cards actor has denied the allegations against him. Both Mr Rapp, now 51 and also an actor, and Mr Spacey were in the Manhattan federal courthouse when the trial opened with jury selection on Thursday.Mr Rapp says that Mr Spacey was around 26 or 27 years old when he met him at a party at his Manhattan apartment. In a Buzzfeed article from October 2017, Mr Rapp said that Mr Spacey had picked him up, placed him on a bed and lay down partially on top of him."I was aware that he was trying to get with me sexually," Mr Rapp said.His lawsuit says the alleged encounter lasted no more than two minutes and "there was no kissing, no undressing, no reaching under clothes, and no sexualized statements or innuendo".The legal action was filed in September 2020 and accuses Mr Spacey - whose real name is Kevin Spacey Fowler - of battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress.Mr Rapp is reportedly seeking $40m (£35m) in damages.The judge assigned to the case, Lewis A Kaplan, previously dismissed a charge of sexual assault, ruling the statute of limitations had expired. One day after the Buzzfeed article was posted five years ago, Mr Spacey took to social media to say he had no memory of what Mr Rapp described. "If I did behave then as he describes, I owe him the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior," he wrote."And I am sorry for the feelings he describes having carried with him all these years."In a video deposition he filmed with lawyers in January, Mr Spacey denied that the incident ever took place, according to news website Law &amp; Crime.  Mr Rapp's account "couldn't have been true", he said, because "I am not interested in boys and I do not touch people inappropriately".Mr Rapp stars in Star Trek: Discovery on Paramount+ and was previously in the Broadway musical Rent. Separate sex assault charges - alleging that Mr Spacey groped an 18-year-old at a restaurant in Nantucket, Massachusetts, in 2016 - collapsed in 2019 after the actor's lawyers argued the accuser had manipulated text messages on his phone.In August, a judge ruled that Spacey must pay $31m to the producers of House of Cards for the costs they incurred after firing him from the show. In July, he entered a not guilty plea in London to criminal charges of sexually assaulting three men over a decade ago. That trial is due to begin in June 2023.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="BBC News, author unspecified"><Text>A global alert has been issued over four cough syrups after the World Health Organization (WHO) warned they could be linked to the deaths of 66 children in The Gambia. The syrups have been "potentially linked with acute kidney injuries and 66 deaths among children", it said. The products were manufactured by an Indian company, Maiden Pharmaceuticals, which had failed to provide guarantees about their safety, the WHO added.The firm has not yet commented.The BBC has contacted Maiden Pharmaceuticals for comment.Indian officials say they have asked the WHO to share evidence of the link between the syrups and the deaths.The WHO identified the medicines as Promethazine Oral Solution, Kofexmalin Baby Cough Syrup, Makoff Baby Cough Syrup and Magrip N Cold Syrup. The four products had been identified in The Gambia, but "may have been distributed, through informal markets, to other countries or regions", the WHO added, in the alert published on its website.It warned that their use may result in serious injury or death, especially among children.The WHO's intervention came after medical authorities in The Gambia - a popular tourist destination - detected an increase in cases of acute kidney injury among children under the age of five in late July.The Gambia's government has since suspended the use of all paracetamol syrups and has urged people to use tablets instead.The number of deaths has declined since the ban but two more have been recorded in the past two weeks, Gambia health services director Mustapha Bittay told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme.He said that The Gambia did not currently have a laboratory capable of testing whether medicines were safe and so they had to be sent abroad for checking. Mr Bittay added that The Gambia was in discussions with the World Bank to get funding for a quality-control laboratory.The WHO said that laboratory analysis of samples of the products "confirms that they contain unacceptable amounts of diethylene glycol and ethylene glycol as contaminants".The substances were toxic, and their effects "can include abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhoea, inability to pass urine, headache, altered mental state and acute kidney injury which may lead to death," it added. Mr Bittay also said that traces had also been found of E.Coli, a bacteria which can cause diarrhoea and vomiting.The Gambia's health officials said last month that dozens of children had died, without giving an exact number.Speaking in Geneva on Wednesday, WHO chief Tedros Ghebreyesus said: "The loss of these young lives is beyond heart-breaking for their families." The WHO said that India's Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation indicated that the manufacturer may have only supplied the contaminated medications to The Gambia, AFP news agency reports, quoting an email from the UN health agency.But the WHO said that "global exposure" was possible as the "manufacturer may have used the same contaminated material in other products and distributed them locally or exported" them, the agency reports. </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Alex Therrien"><Text>A top chess player accused of cheating has insisted he is "not going to back down" after making his first comments on the scandal in nearly a month.On Tuesday, a Chess.com investigation claimed it was "likely" Hans Niemann cheated in more than 100 games online.The 19-year-old American rising star had already been accused of cheating by world champion Magnus Carlsen.Speaking on Wednesday after winning his US Championship game, Niemann said his victory was "a message to everyone". In a news conference following a convincing win against 15-year-old grandmaster Christopher Yoo, Niemann was asked about the "elephant in the room" - a reference to the cheating scandal that has gripped the chess world.Without addressing the allegations directly, Niemann said: "This game is a message to everyone. This entire thing started with me saying 'chess speaks for itself' and I think this game spoke for itself and showed the chess player I am. "It also showed I'm not going to back down and I'm going to play my best chess here regardless of the pressure."Niemann then cut the interview short after less than 60 seconds.The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on Twitter"You can leave it to your own interpretation, but thank you, that's it", he said when the interviewer tried to ask more questions."That's all I can say, because it was such a beautiful game I don't even need to describe it," he concluded.  Niemann, who was playing in the first round of the US Championship in St Louis, then walked out of the interview, prompting commentator Yasser Seirawan to laugh and say: "What? That's it? Ok." Until the interview Niemann had not spoken about the scandal since 7 September when he admitted to cheating in informal games when he was younger but strenuously denied doing so in competitive games.Niemann added that he was willing to play naked to prove his innocence and accused Carlsen and Chess.com of trying to ruin his career. The cheating row that's blowing up the chess worldWorld's top chess player accuses opponent of cheatingChess player 'likely cheated' in 100 games - reportThe scandal began last month after 31-year-old Carlsen, considered by many to be the greatest player of all time, was defeated by Niemann at the Sinquefield Cup in a major upset. The Norwegian made veiled accusations of cheating against Niemann at the time before openly accusing him last week. Then on Tuesday, a Chess.com investigation claimed it was likely Niemann had cheated "much more often" than he had admitted to, including in prize money events and against highly-rated "well known" figures in the game. Chess.com also noted "anomalies" in Niemann's rate of improvement, which has seen him soar up the rankings in classical chess from around 800 in the world to the top 50 in less than two years.The site said this rise was the fastest in "modern recorded history" and had occurred "much later in life than his peers".But it found no evidence he had cheated in his game against Carlsen or in any other over-the-board games.A separate statistical analysis of Niemann's over-the-board games by Prof Kenneth Regan, widely regarded as the world's leading expert on cheating in chess, has also found no evidence he cheated.Not since 2006's "Toiletgate" has chess faced a cheating scandal at the elite levels of the game. Back then, world championship challenger Veselin Topalov's team accused the champion Vladimir Kramnik of cheating during his "strange, if not suspicious" trips to the bathroom. Prof Regan also found no evidence Kramnik had cheated.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Nathan Williams"><Text>Gunmen have shot dead the mayor of a small town in western Mexico, and at least 17 others, officials say.Police say gunmen stormed the San Miguel Totolapan town hall at 14:00 (19:00 GMT) on Wednesday. Photos online show it riddled with bullet holes.Mayor Conrado Mendoza Almeda's left-wing PRD party condemned his "cowardly" assassination and demanded justice.The attack has been blamed on the Los Tequileros criminal gang, which is linked to a powerful drug cartel.Police officers and council workers were also killed in the massacre, with graphic images of bloodied bodies lying on the ground circulating on social media. Mr Mendoza Almeda's father, former mayor Juan Mendoza Acosta, was also killed - in his home - before the attack moved to the town hall.A highway in the state of Guerrero, where San Miguel Totolapan lies, was reportedly briefly blocked by large vehicles to prevent security forces from getting into the city.Even by the violent standards of Guerrero state, this was a shocking attack, reports the BBC's Mexico correspondent, Will Grant.San Miguel Totolapan lies in the heart of a region known as Tierra Caliente, a violent part of drug cartel-controlled western Mexico. Various groups battle for control of the lucrative drug routes north along the Pacific corridor, our correspondent adds. The region is a hotspot for the growing of opium poppies and the production of heroin.In a preliminary report seen by local media, Guerrero's attorney general said that as well as the 18 people who were killed, three others were wounded.It is not yet clear what the motive behind the attack may have been but killings of local officials are not uncommon.In 2018, at least three dozen mayors, former mayors and mayoral candidates were killed. The number has dwindled to single figures in recent years but those who hold local office remain at risk from armed gangs, which often want to be the only authority in town.Following the attack, the defence ministry said it was deploying army and navy units to the area to find the gunmen.  Guerrero Governor Evelyn Salgado Pineda tweeted to say she deeply regretted the deaths.Shortly before the attack, alleged members of Los Tequileros released a video on social networks announcing its return to the region, where they had been fighting a rival drug gang.The criminal group devastated Guerrero between 2015 and 2017 - and was known for threatening mayors of the region - until its leader Raybel Jacobo de Almonte was assassinated.De Almonte was known as El Tequilero - the Tequila Drinker - and his gang took their name from him.Additional reporting by Tiffany Wertheimer</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Tessa Wong"><Text>I'm stuck at home taking care of a sick child, when a familiar feeling suddenly hits - a craving for durian.But there's no need to head out to a durian stall or supermarket to buy the tropical fruit, lug it home, and wrestle open its spiky husk.I just whip out my phone, open an app called Grab, and make a few taps.Forty-five minutes later, there's a knock on my door. A deliveryman hands over a bag: it's my durian, freshly shucked and sealed in plastic tubs, ready to eat.From ordering cabs and food, to paying our bills and booking holidays, super-apps like Grab offer a mindboggling array of services. They don't exist yet in the West - Elon Musk is thinking of creating one called X - but in many parts of Asia they've already been a vital part of our everyday lives for the past few years. I mostly use Grab to get a ride home after a night out, or order Thai takeaway when I haven't got the energy to cook dinner for the family.But many in Singapore also use it to send parcels and documents, or shop online - one colleague just purchased a home karaoke set.     Other extensions allow you to book bus and ferry tickets, make hotel reservations, and even arrange for someone to come to your home and do a professional Covid swab test.These can be paid for through the app's finance system. There's an e-wallet linked to your bank account or credit card, or you can set up instalment plans, or pay with points which you earn with every activity done through the app. It can also be used for cashless payments - you pay for items at a shop by scanning a QR code with the app, or you can get a physical card linked to your account.But Grab is not the only player in town.There are super-apps aplenty from Indonesia's GoJek to India's PayTM and they allow you to do even more, such as book a manicure, order fuel for your motorbike, pay your traffic fine and purchase gold. They have caught on in a region of digital natives - in South East Asia alone, about three-quarters of our population use the internet, and of that group, 88% own a smartphone.Elon Musk, Twitter and the mysterious X app Then, there's China's WeChat - the original Asian super-app said to be the inspiration for Mr Musk's X.It's a messaging and social media platform that's evolved into one of the region's biggest apps in terms of its range of services and number of users. At last count it's estimated to have 1.29 billion users in China alone. WeChat is also one of China's biggest payment networks, with consumers using it to pay for goods and services and to send money to each other. Some research suggests that a Chinese user spends as much as a third of their waking life on WeChat alone.Much has been written about how its ubiquity in Chinese everyday life, operating in a society tightly controlled by the government has seen WeChat become a tool of surveillance and censorship.Messages, posts and even accounts are routinely blocked for content deemed politically sensitive, and there are concerns of how it could contribute to the various controversial "social credit" schemes in China, where citizens' lives can be restricted based on their bank credit scores or social behaviour. In 2020, WeChat introduced its own scoring system where users get extra privileges if they have good in-app credit records.The example of WeChat highlights the main concern about super-apps - with everyone doing practically everything on just a few platforms, these apps end up collecting a vast trove of data on people, and could wield some power over our daily lives.WeChat and the Surveillance StateHow such data is treated and to what extent governments should have access to it will be part of the debate in societies where privacy is particularly prized. Mr Musk's X super-app - if it does come to fruition - may be seen by some with suspicion as a double-edged Swiss Army knife.For others though, the convenience and simplicity of living life on one app is an easy trade-off to make. There's always the option of scaling back their use, for those with deep concerns about privacy.And in open markets, specialty apps will continue to vie for users' attention, reducing the likelihood of most of the data ending up in the hands of just one or two companies - one reason for WeChat's dominance in China is because some apps like Twitter and WhatsApp are blocked there.Here in Singapore, I don't do everything on Grab. It's not because I distrust it, but I prefer using specialty apps to do other things like grocery shopping and buying clothes as they're just better at it.So I'm fine with Grab humming away in the recesses of my phone because it doesn't know everything about me, just some things - like the fact that I love delivery durian.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Ashley Lime &amp; Carolyne Kiambo"><Text>A school dormitory in western Kenya burned down a few weeks ago and several students were arrested on suspicion of arson - just the latest instance of a devastating criminal pattern that has dominated the country's education system for more than 30 years. Last year saw a particular spike in the number of boarding school arson attacks by the pupils, which students blamed on an intensified curriculum following time lost to the Covid lockdown. The second half of the year saw an average of three a week. The BBC has spoken to students whose schools have been set on fire to investigate what lies behind the regular attacks.The names of the students have been changedIt was about 16:30 on a Sunday afternoon when someone on the school field spotted the fire. At first, Lillian wasn't too worried. It was just the matron burning rubbish, someone said. But before long, screaming students began streaming out of the school building. Smoke was pouring out of Lillian's dorm. Lillian [not her real name], 15 at the time of the attack last October, was terrified. She knew her good friend was in the building having a nap."People were crying, they were traumatised… [I could see] smoke had covered the entire dorm."They watched as students at Buruburu Girls High School - in the capital Nairobi - began jumping from the windows to escape. Lillian doesn't know for sure what provoked the arson attack. But she claims that students were deeply unhappy about the amount of academic pressure they were under in the run up to national exams."We're usually in class by 4.30am every morning," Lillian told the BBC last November. Independent study then continued to 22:00, she said. Boarding schools are the main educators of secondary school-aged children in Kenya - seen as a way of getting good quality subsidised education, and places where children can concentrate on their studies.Another student, Mary, 16, confirmed that there had been no extra curricular activities last year, and said the academic schedule had been intense."We had to add more lessons to cover the syllabus in time… it was quite challenging." The terrors of Kenya’s school fire epidemic Her mother confirmed that her daughter had complained of long hours and poor student-teacher relations. The BBC asked Buruburu Girls High School to comment but it did not respond. Kenya's boarding schools are educationally demanding, admits Dr Newton Mwangi, a former principal of Passenga Secondary School who retired last year."Nowadays a child who does not make a good score to take him or her to university is like a condemned child," he says.Arson attacks are not a new issue in Kenyan boarding schools - the deadliest Kenyan school arson took place 20 years ago, killing 67 students in Machakos County, south-east of Nairobi.The fires are particularly dangerous because they are usually lit in dormitories, as was the case in Lillian's school. Although her friend finally emerged through the fire exit unscathed, 59 of the girls were reported by local media to have received hospital treatment for smoke inhalation, minor burns, and fractures.  Such attacks have historically been debated only behind closed doors - the government refuses to share data with the media on the number of school arson attacks, or discuss the issue. But in November 2021, the Ministry of Education issued a response to a parliamentary committee which had requested more information on the school arson crisis and revealed that there were 126 arson cases between January and November last year. It revealed that 302 students had been arrested in connection with those incidents and of those, 41 had appeared in court accused of arson and destruction of property.We don't know how many of those 41 were found guilty, because Kenyan courts restrict reporting on crimes involving children, children's lawyer Paul Muchiri told the BBC. One of the few convictions we are aware of took place earlier this year. An 18-year-old was found guilty of manslaughter for starting a fire that resulted in the death of 10 students at Moi Girls High School in Nairobi in 2017 when she was 14. The student, only identified as TWG, was handed a five-year prison term. The Ministry of Education statement issued in November listed what it believed to be the reasons behind the arson epidemic, which included: overcrowding, poor teacher-student relations, drug abuse, and inadequate counselling services within schools. It suggested however that the fault did not just lie with academic institutions, remarking that parents were "overprotective" of their children when accused of misbehaviour, and that the law hindered teachers' ability to discipline pupils. Its recommendations included recruiting professional school counsellors - but it also suggested "critically" examining the role of boarding schools in Kenya's education system. Lillian not only missed nine days of school as a result of the destruction, but all students' families were asked to pay collective damages, a common policy according to local media reports. Lillian's mother shared a letter from the school with the BBC dated 5 November - five days after the fire - requesting 1,500 Kenyan shillings [£10] "for damages incurred". The family lives in a slum and she says this was a huge amount of money for the family to find.The Ministry of Education did not respond to the BBC's request for an interview. School arson is not unique to Kenya, says Elizabeth Cooper, a Canadian academic and anthropologist who has spent years in Kenya studying the issue.But she says what is remarkable is its frequency, severity and collective nature. "Many students participate, sometimes planning in advance, sometimes being coerced to participate by other students… [which] points to… this idea that there could be some consensus around the logic of using arson," she told the BBC.Dr Cooper believes this might be because students feel as though setting fire to their schools is working to an extent, and that it might be time to consider a different approach to education in Kenya, which currently relies on "trying to strong-arm [students] into compliance". The potential to shift thinking on this might lie with teacher training colleges, she says, but parents, governors and politicians would all need to be brought on board, meaning it will take time "to try shifting the culture of how education is done".</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Jonathan Beale"><Text>The war in Ukraine has underlined the growing importance of space to armies on the ground. In an interview with the BBC, the head of the US Space Force, General Jay Raymond, describes it as the "first war where commercial space capabilities have really played a significant role". It's also the first  major conflict in which both sides have become so reliant on space.Gen Raymond - whose service is the newest branch of the US armed forces - avoids giving precise details of how the US and its allies have been helping Ukraine. But he gives a clear indication of what it's been doing. "We use space to help strike with precision, we use space to provide warnings of missiles, of any threat that could come to the United States or to our allies or partners," he says. There are already more than 5,000 satellites in space - most are operated for commercial purposes. But among them are hundreds of dedicated military satellites - the US, Russia and China having the largest number. Ukraine has none. But it has received significant help from the West in a number of ways. The first is providing intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance - or ISR. Ukraine has had access to unprecedented amounts of commercial satellite imagery. At a recent conference, the director of the US National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency said it had more than doubled the commercial imagery available over Ukraine in the run-up to the war.  Air Vice-Marshal Paul Godfrey, who heads the UK's Space Command, says that along with commercial and civilian ISR provided to Ukraine "there's an awful lot of nations with military capabilities in space - they're looking at Ukraine as well".Space ISR helped identify the initial build-up of Russian forces before the invasion on 24 February and the movement of troops and military hardware ever since. Satellites have been used to track Russian warships in the Black Sea, including the cruiser Moskva which was sunk by Ukraine.  Early warning radar - like the giant one at RAF Fylingdales in North Yorkshire - have also been able to track the launch of ballistic missiles.Air Vice-Marshal Godfrey says ISR satellites have also been essential for "telling the truth" about the war. He gives the example of the massacre in Bucha, near Ukraine's capital Kyiv. He says Russian claims that the bodies of dead civilians were already on the streets when they arrived were contradicted by time-stamped satellite imagery showing otherwise. Media organisations, including the BBC, have also had unprecedented access to commercial satellite imagery - which can be used to corroborate claims on the ground. That includes identifying mass graves or Ukraine's recent attack on a Russian airbase in Crimea, a southern Ukrainian peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014. Early warning radar have also been able to track the launch of ballistic missiles. The US is also now in detailed  discussions about installing more giant radar in the UK to keep an eye on what's happening in space.And recently Ukrainian volunteers have fundraised enough money to buy an entire satellite to help the country's military in detecting Russian targets.The Sar (Synthetic Aperture Radar) satellite of the Finnish company ICEYE has proved to be extremely effective - in just the first two days of its usage the Russian military damages exceeded $16m - more that the cost of the satellite purchase, Ukrainian officials say.Space has also been crucial to communications throughout the war. At the start of the war Russia conducted a series of military strikes and cyber-attacks to take out Ukraine's key communication nodes. Air Vice-Marshal Godfrey credits Elon Musk with "essentially getting the internet back up and running in Ukraine" - helped by an appeal on Twitter by the Ukrainian Minister of Digital Transformation, Mykhailo Fedorov.The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterElon Musk has sent thousands of Starlink internet kits to Ukraine giving access to SpaceX's constellation of satellites in orbit. They've been essential to providing Ukraine's military with secure communications and situational awareness throughout the war. I've seen them being used from Ukrainian command bunkers in the country's eastern Donbas region.  Both Russia, and more recently Ukraine, have been relying on space-based positioning, navigation and timing (PNT) to conduct precision strikes on key targets, with Russia's cruise missiles using its own Glonass positioning satellites to find their targets. For Ukraine, the addition of US-supplied precision weapons to its arsenal have been key to its recent advances. Himars rockets - which have a range of up to 50 miles (80km) and are guided by GPS - have been used to destroy key targets, such as ammunition dumps and command centres well behind the frontline. More recently, the US has supplied Ukraine with GPS  guided Excalibur artillery shells - more accurate than so-called dumb ammunition. Precision has made a difference. The increasing reliance on space raises concerns that conflict could spread beyond land, sea and air. Russia and China have both conducted tests to destroy their own satellites, and Admiral Tony Radakin, the UK's Chief of the Defence Staff, has recently warned that Russia could carry out attacks on Western targets in space.  Gen Raymond says "there's a full spectrum of threats we're concerned about". He lists GPS and communications jamming, direct energy weapons like lasers, or missiles fired from the ground which could be used to target satellites. He says the US and its allies want to make sure that there's always safe and responsible behaviour in space - but adds "what worries me is not everybody shares that view". In reality, the militarisation of space is well under way.

But it's a move with other Scandinavian precedents.In 2019, Sweden's monarch, King Carl XVI Gustaf, removed royal status from five of his grandchildren.It was again with a nod towards the public mood of not wanting too many royals getting taxpayers' funding.Danish Queen 'sorry' over stripping of royal titlesSwedish King removes grandchildren's royal statusHow is the Royal Family in Britain funded?It might also be seen as an inevitable consequence of the hereditary and dynastic principle of monarchy. Family trees are often going to get bigger, with widening branches of children, grandchildren and relations.So, like clipping back a royal garden, every so often there will have to be a careful pruning of those defined as having royal status.This reduced-scale approach in Denmark might be in tune with public opinion, with more than three-quarters supporting the monarchy.This is also a country where the level of public funding for the royal family - currently about £11m per year for the queen, her residences and staff - is linked to the pay index of Denmark's state-sector employees.But could this be an example for the British Royal Family, with King Charles III long associated with calls for a "slimmed-down" monarchy?This has never been very specifically defined, but has been interpreted as a plan to focus more tightly on a smaller group of royals - sending a message of purposeful frugality.It's like the wedding photograph with just the main participants rather than the group shot of whoever was there at the time.This slimming down might have already happened by default, with Prince Andrew, Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex no longer carrying out royal duties or receiving public funding. Buckingham Palace now uses the concept of "working royals" for a smaller group who carry out the round of visits, ceremonies and constitutional duties, distinguishing them from a wider range of royal relatives.The working royals include the King, Queen Consort, Prince William and Catherine, the Princess of Wales; Princess Anne; Prince Edward and Sophie, Countess of Wessex; Princess Alexandra and the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester.Last year there were 2,300 official engagements carried out. Princess Anne on her own carried out almost 400.At the Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations earlier this year, the distinction between working and non-working royals was visibly played out on the symbolic platform of the Buckingham Palace balcony.Prince Harry and Meghan, and Prince Andrew were not on the balcony to wave to the crowds. There were 18 royals on view - presenting much less of a crowd scene, when on occasions in the past there have been more than 40 people on the balcony.The reign of the new King has only just begun, but there are likely to be questions about how he might want to re-shape the monarchy and how the royal households will be run.Close to the issue of the size of the monarchy will be its cost to the public.The public funding of the Royal Family in Britain comes via the Sovereign Grant, which is based on a proportion of the profits from the independently-run Crown Estates.This pays for the running costs of the monarchy and its working royals - such as staff, travel, overseas visits, the upkeep of buildings, with £86m received last year, with extra costs from renovating Buckingham Palace pushing up overall spending to £102m.The Prince of Wales also has an income from the Duchy of Cornwall and the monarch has a private income from the Duchy of Lancaster.Although slimming down the number of cash-hungry royal buildings, rather than the number of people, could be the biggest financial question. Repairs and refurbishments to Buckingham Palace alone cost £54m last year, more than half the total of expenditure.However, the new King can look to the future with a sense of rising popularity, according to YouGov polling last month, which showed 70% now having a positive view of him, up from 54% earlier in the year and before he took to the throne.But there are big underlying generational differences in attitudes towards the monarchy, according to YouGov. While about two-thirds across all ages back the monarchy, it's below half for 18-24 year olds.Monarchies have always had to adapt to survive. As Queen Margrethe said about her own slimming-down plans, she had to "ensure that the monarchy always shapes itself in keeping with the times".</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Nadine Yousif"><Text>For humans, staying warm in the winter often means swapping out flimsy tank-tops for thick parkas. For Alaskan bears, it means eating a jaw-dropping 500lb (225 kg) of fresh salmon. These bulking creatures are the focal point of Fat Bear Week - a highly anticipated online bracket that pits the portly mammals at Alaska's Katmai National Park against one another, with voters crowning the fattest of them all.  The competition is stiff this year: Otis, a large adult bear with the record for most Fat Bear Week wins at four, is back to defend his title. He once ate 42 salmon in one sitting, and his fishing skills and patience are hard to beat. But Bear 747, winner of Fat Bear Week 2020, might give Otis a run for his money. He is one of the largest bears on earth, weighing as much as 1,400lb (635kg). Most bears know they can't compete with him. The winner of Fat Bear Week 2022 remains to be seen. Voting is open until 11 October - Fat Bear Tuesday - when the champion will be crowned. Until then, people can watch their favourite bears via livestream and follow their journey as they pile on their gains for the winter and feast at Alaska's Brooks River, located in Katmai National Park's sprawling eight million acre reserve.  Organisers of the "extremely popular" Fat Bear extravaganza say viewers tune in from almost every country in the world, and have taken quite a liking to the charismatic creatures. "It's fairly rare to get to know wild animals on an individual level," said Mike Fitz, founder of the inaugural Fat Bear Week in 2014 and the resident naturalist with explore.org, which operates the bear livestreams. Each bear has a unique story, Mr Fitz said, and some have developed quite the fan base. For example, Otis has a loyal following who enjoy his poise and calm in stressful hunting conditions. "[Otis] goes to his spot, he sits there, he waits for his meals to come to him, and it is a very successful strategy," Mr Fitz said. "He's the most patient bear that I have ever seen."Others marvel at the steadfastness of mother bears who are devoted to keeping their cubs safe and fed before they are forced to seek shelter from the cold. Fat Bear Week also teaches onlookers how North American brown bears prepare for the winter - by getting fat to survive. Bears emerge from their hibernation in the summer months weary and thin. They then spend their time hunting enormous amounts of fish. By October, they've put on so much weight that some are almost unrecognisable. In November, the bears start heading towards their dens where they will hibernate for six months. In that time, they don't eat, drink water, or pass urine or faeces."They're surviving at that time just on their body fat," Mr Fitz said, adding that they remain healthy throughout.Like its ursine* stars - [*definition: 'of, or to do with bears'] - Fat Bear Week seems to have hit its peak. Mr Fitz said votes on the first day, 5 October, had already surpassed last year's. As for who his favourite hefty hibernator is, Mr Fitz said he has officially endorsed Bear 747. "I think he is the fattest bear so he deserves the vote, but other people are welcome to disagree - and they often do," he said.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Andrew Harding"><Text>Young children are dying in growing numbers in Somalia amid the worst drought to hit the country in 40 years. Government officials say that an even greater catastrophe could sweep the country within days or weeks unless more help arrives.The tears tumbled down 11-year-old Dahir's hunger-hollowed cheeks. "I just want to survive this," he said quietly. Seated beside the family's makeshift tent, on the dusty plain outside the city of Baidoa, his weary mother, Fatuma Omar, told him not to cry."Your tears will not bring your brother back. Everything will be fine," she said. Fatuma's second son, 10-year-old Salat, died of starvation two weeks ago, shortly after the family reached Baidoa from their village, three days' walk away. His body is buried in the rocky earth a few metres from their new home - the grave already covered in litter and increasingly hard to spot as new arrivals set up camp around them. "I cannot grieve for my son. There is no time. I need to find work and food to keep the others alive," Fatuma said, cradling her youngest daughter, nine-month-old Bille, and turning to look at six-year-old Mariam as she gave a rasping cough.On the other side of the dirt road that loops to the south-east, towards the coast and Somalia's capital, Mogadishu, other displaced families told more grim stories of long treks across a drought-parched landscape in search of food.  A new survey has shown that almost two-thirds of young children and pregnant women in the camps are suffering from acute malnutrition, which, along with a high death rate, could indicate that a localised declaration of famine is already overdue."I saw my daughter [three-year-old Farhir] die before me and I could do nothing," said Fatuma, who had walked for at least 15 days with her nine children from a village called Buulo Ciir to reach Baidoa."I had been carrying her for 10 days. We had to leave her by the side of the road. We had no strength to bury her. We could hear the hyenas closing in," she continued. "I've brought nothing with me. There is nothing left at home. The cattle are dead. The fields are dry," said Habiba Mohamud, 50, clutching a piece of twine in one hand, and acknowledging that she will never return to her village.A succession of droughts, turbo-charged by climate change, is now threatening to end a pastoral way of life that has endured for centuries across the Horn of Africa.Like other new arrivals, Habiba was busy erecting a tent for her family from branches, twigs, and scavenged scraps of cardboard and plastic sheeting, hoping to finish it before the chill of night. Only after that could she turn to finding food and medical help for some of her five children.On the admissions ward in the city's main hospital, Dr Abdullahi Yussuf moved between beds, checking on his tiny, emaciated patients. Most were children between two months and three years old. All were severely malnourished. Some had pneumonia and many were battling a new outbreak of measles too. Few infants had the strength to cry. Several had badly damaged skin, broken by the swelling that sometimes accompanies the most extreme cases of hunger. "So many die before they even reach a hospital," said Dr Abdullahi, watching his team struggling to connect an intravenous tube to the arm of a moaning two-year-old.Although Somali officials and international organisations have been sounding the alarm for months about an impending famine in this south-western region, Dr Abdullahi said his hospital was already short of basic items including nutritional supplements for children."Sometimes we lack supplies. It's terrifying, actually, because people are dying, and we can't support them. Our local government is not handling this well. It has not been planning for the drought or for the arrival of displaced families," he said, with visible frustration.A local government minister conceded there had been failings."We need to be faster than we are, and we need to be accurate… and more effective," said Nasir Arush, Minister for Humanitarian Affairs for South West state, on a short visit to one of the camps around Baidoa. But more international support, he insisted, was key."If we don't receive the aid we need, hundreds of thousands of people will die. The things we're doing now we needed to do three months ago. In reality we are behind. Unless something happens [fast] I think something catastrophic will happen in this area," he said.The process of formally declaring a famine can be a complicated one, reliant on hard-to-pin-down data, and, often, political considerations. Britain's ambassador in Mogadishu, Kate Foster, described it as "essentially, a technical process". She pointed out that during the 2011 drought "half of the 260,000 deaths happened before famine was declared".The presidential envoy leading Somalia's international effort to secure more funding thanked the US government, in particular, for recent new funding, saying it "has given us hope".But Abdirahman Abdishakur warned that without more help, a localised crisis in one part of Somalia could quickly spin out of control."We were raising the alarm… but the response of the international community was not adequate," Mr Abdishakur said."Famine is projected. It happens [already] in some places, some pockets, in Somalia, but still we can prevent the catastrophic one," he continued, speaking by phone during a stopover in Toronto, Canada.Although estimates vary, the population of Baidoa has roughly quadrupled in the past few months, to around 800,000 people. And any visitor will quickly notice one striking fact: almost all the new adult arrivals are women.Somalia is at war. The conflict has endured, in different guises, since the central government collapsed three decades ago, and it continues to affect almost every part of the country, tearing men away from their families to fight for an array of armed groups.Like most of those arriving in Baidoa, Hadija Abukar recently escaped from territory controlled by militant Islamist group al-Shabab."Even now I'm getting calls on my phone from the rest of my family. There is fighting there - between the government and al-Shabab. My relatives have run away and are hiding in the forest," she said, seated beside her sickly child at a small hospital in Baidoa.Other women spoke of husbands and older sons being blocked from leaving areas controlled by the militants, and of years of extortion by the group. Baidoa itself is not quite surrounded by al-Shabab, but it remains a precarious place of refuge. International aid organisations, and foreign journalists, require heavy security to move around, and any travel beyond the city limits is considered extremely risky."We're looking at populations that are under siege. Sometimes it feels quite hopeless," said Charles Nzuki, who heads the UN children's fund, Unicef, in central and southern Somalia.According to some estimates, more than half the population affected by the current drought remains in areas controlled by al-Shabab. Strict US government rules blocking any assistance from benefitting designated terrorist groups have complicated efforts to reach many desperate communities. But international organisations, and the Somali authorities, are working with smaller local partners to increase access and are now planning air drops into some contested territories. Still, one aid worker, speaking off the record, acknowledged that it was almost impossible to guarantee that no food or funds were reaching al-Shabab."Let's not be naïve, [al-Shabab] taxes everything, even cash donations," they said. Over the years, the militant group has established a reputation not just for violence and intimidation but for delivering justice in a country with a hard-earned reputation for official corruption. In at least four villages close to Baidoa, al-Shabab runs a network of Sharia courts that are routinely used by the city's residents and, reportedly, by people in Mogadishu and beyond, to settle business and land disputes. Further to the north-east, a sudden uprising against al-Shabab has seen local communities and clan militias - now heavily backed by the central government - drive the group out of dozens of towns and villages in recent weeks. The military successes have prompted a surge of optimism, but it is not clear if that will help in the fight against famine, or simply distract the Somali government."It might, or it might not [help]. I think it may create more [civilian] displacement. Or the government might liberate more areas and people might have more access [to aid]. So, we're looking at it from all sides," said local minister Nasir Arush.In Baidoa itself - a busy city of narrow, cobbled streets scarred by decades of conflict and neglect - the prices of basic goods, like rice, have doubled in the past month. Many residents blamed the drought, but others also looked further afield."Flour, sugar, oil - they've all risen by about the same amount. Sometimes we have to skip meals. I heard about the war between Russia and Ukraine. People say that is the root cause of these problems," said Shukri Moalim Ali, 38, walking over to her dry well, and barren vegetable patch.While the fight to ward off a deeper, spreading famine is the immediate focus in this region, Somalia's new government is also looking ahead, seeking to address more existential questions about the future."It is a challenging task, to respond to the drought, to fight against al-Shabab, and to campaign to access [international] climate justice finance," Abdirahman Abdishakur said."We have a young population, an enormous diaspora, and vibrant entrepreneurial skills. So that gives us hope. It's challenging, but we don't have an alternative."</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Katty Kay"><Text>The upcoming midterm elections for US Congress, the first nationwide vote since Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol nearly two years ago, have many Americans on edge. The BBC's Katty Kay has been finding out why.Karen and Steve don't want to take up arms. But if Republicans lose in November this elderly Arizona couple say a civil war is coming and, yes, they will fight. They have discussed it between them, and feel that taking up arms is their best option. It was at this point that our conversation grew a little dark and my faith in the strength of American democracy grew a little shaky. I met the Slatons at their Trump paraphernalia store in Show Low, Arizona. It was one of the first stops on a month-long road trip that I took around America this summer, a journey to understand why the upcoming elections feel so consequential, perhaps even a little ominous.The couple were delightful hosts. They were funny and generous. They took me on a tour of their extensive stock of whacky Trump merchandise and explained that, yes, there really are people who want a $100 life-size cut-out of the former president dressed as Rambo to put in their living rooms. Quite a lot of people actually. Trump as Rambo is one of their best selling items. We talked about history, the economy and even abortion. But it was only when I questioned their belief that the 2020 election was stolen that things got tense. Wasn't it possible, I asked, that millions of Americans just didn't like President Trump and so Joe Biden won the election? It was Karen who responded, with a distinctly steely glint: "If you're a crazy liberal, we're just not interested. The central news, let me call them, I'm not going to call them fake news, but it is fake news to say that America doesn't like Trump. America loves Trump."The BBC is not fake news, but I let that pass. The idea of war, however, demanded clarification. "It will start on a small scale, it will be like town against a town, state against a state," Steve had clearly thought this through. People have been tossing this idea of a second American civil war around for a couple of years now, ever since the 2020 election, ever since the violence of the Capitol Riots on 6 January, 2021. I find it hard to believe - maybe I lack imagination - but the idea of Americans going to war over a lost election still seems implausible. But that's Steve's take on what happened last time: "When Lincoln won, that triggered the South." That's not the only view of the origins of the American Civil War, but this wasn't the moment for a history debate; it's the present that needs attention. As I said goodbye to the Slatons, Steve threw out a warning. It was said with a habitual American friendly smile, but it was chilling nonetheless: "This could turn really nasty." Just how nasty was what I was trying to find out. You can watch Katty's hour-long film in the UK on iPlayer.In the US and Canada, it is available on BBC Select.And it will be broadcast on BBC World News on 8 and 9 October. Click on the links for details.Americans cast their ballots for control of Congress every two years. The congressional elections that fall in years when they aren't voting for president are called midterms. Because the White House isn't up for grabs, midterms generally don't get much attention and turnout hovers around 40%, lower than the 50-60% that vote in presidential elections. But this year feels different. This is the first national election since the storming of the Capitol and will test whether America can hold an election without violence. And, to be clear, the war talk from Americans like the Slatons is not normal pre-election rhetoric. In two and a half decades in America I've covered 10 US election cycles, I have never heard voters talk about politics in this violent way.Karen and Steve's views are not fringe views either. The belief that the 2020 election was stolen has seeped into the mainstream like a virus that now infects the entire democratic process. Polls since the election suggest that about 70% of Republicans believe Joe Biden is not the legitimate president. That's about one third of the American electorate, or more than 50 million people - not far off the population of Britain. This summer on a tour of Arizona, Wyoming, Georgia and Pennsylvania, I spoke to dozens of voters who are convinced Joe Biden is not America's legitimate president. If you felt an election had been stolen from you, you'd be angry too. Indeed, maybe you'd feel it was something worth fighting for. The problem is there is no evidence to support the stolen election claim. More than 60 lawsuits were brought by Trump's lawyers claiming election fraud. All but one was dismissed for lack of evidence. Some of the suits were even heard by Trump appointed judges, and they, too, tossed the cases out. Key Republican election officials in battleground states, like Arizona, and Georgia, also said the election process had been fair and accurate. There is no evidence of fraud that would have overturned Joe Biden's win. That hasn't stopped the fraud conspiracy virus from spreading. Trump may have launched it, but it has now spread across the country and taken on a life of its own. It is different from policy issues like gun rights or taxes. People have strong beliefs about those things too - Steve and Karen Slaton certainly did. But disagreements on those issues have facts that both sides can debate. The "election was stolen" is not a debatable issue. There are no facts on that side of the argument. In that way it's more like an unshakable belief system, and from my interviews I'm not sure the faithful would change their minds even if Trump himself were to suddenly say Biden won fair and square. The impact of this conspiracy on the US voting system was made clear to me in Georgia, in the election offices of Paulding County, where public officials are gearing up for the midterms with some trepidation. Deirdre Holden is an unelected civil servant with the job of Supervisor of Elections and Voter Registration. She is in charge of the mechanics of voting, making sure polling stations operate smoothly, ballots are collected safely and counted accurately. Holden doesn't tear up easily, but when she rereads the threat letter she received after the 2020 election she chokes, for just a second. "This election is effing rigged," it reads. (Deirdre is exceptionally polite, she has that wonderful Southern gentility, and she wants to spare me the profanities.) "Detonations will occur at every polling site in this county. No one at these places will be spared. If you think we're bluffing, eff-ing try. You've been warned. We will end you all." Deirdre puts down the letter and wipes her eye. If I got that message, I'd be afraid to come into work, but what I'm seeing isn't fear, it's anger. "I never was scared. I was mad. Mad that someone tries to threaten us, to threaten the people that just want to cast their vote. That didn't sit very well with me," Deirdre says. When her office in Paulding County (which by the way voted for Trump, though that really shouldn't matter) received that threat after the 2020 election, they passed it onto the FBI. Agents told her she ought to start parking her car outside her office window; it would help limit the force impact of an explosion, they explained. Deirdre wasn't the only election official to be targeted after that vote. The select committee investigating the Capitol Riot interviewed several witnesses who had been threatened, along with their families. After Al Schmidt, Philadelphia's elected Republican city commissioner, defended the election's integrity and confirmed Biden's win, he got one text that read, "You lied. You [are] a traitor. Perhaps 75 cuts and 20 bullets will arrive soon." The Brennan Center for Public Justice examined the aftermath of the 2020 election and concluded that threats against both elected and unelected election officials reached unprecedented levels. According to their findings, one in three election officials said they felt unsafe doing the job. Little surprise that large numbers quit after 2020. The question is why so much mistrust and anger now? Americans have been polarised for decades and this is not the first conspiracy theory to take hold here. But we haven't seen a storming of the US Capitol before, nor so many threats to election officials, nor so much attention paid to trying to change the election rules. How will new voting laws affect the election?Tracking Trump's 'extraordinary' endorsement spreeJoe Biden says Trump ideology threatens US democracyThe answer, most political observers suggest, is a confluence of events that allowed the election denying conspiracy to spread, thereby weakening the whole system. First, Trump started saying the vote would be rigged against him, long before the election even happened. He undermined trust before a single ballot was cast. Then, election rules changed in 2020 to accommodate Covid restrictions. Election deniers say those changes, which included more early voting and more postal votes, left the system open to widespread fraud (though there's no evidence of that.) The Brennan report also points to the impact of social media. "In 2020, political actors ramped up the lies about election processes, often on social media" the report found. "This disinformation has indelibly changed the lives and careers of election officials." Almost 80% of election officials, according to the report, say the rise of misinformation has made their jobs more difficult. Over a half say it has made them more dangerous. "People just have lost their trust. And that's what breaks my heart," says election official Deirdre Holden. And like the Slatons, she leaves me with a warning - November's midterms are going to be worse. Deirdre is non-partisan. I spent a few hours with her and I can honestly say I have no idea how she votes. That's exactly as it should be. The running of democratic elections should be in the hands of officials who have no bias. The people who organise the voting, count the ballots and certify the results should not inject their own politics into the process. When they do, trust is lost. And in this respect, the dispute over 2020 has shown the American system to be uniquely vulnerable. The US is the only Western democracy where the senior election officials are not civil servants. At the state level, it is the post of secretary of state that runs the election. And that person is elected, as a Democrat or a Republican. This November there are some 200 Republicans on the ballot who say they believe the 2020 election was stolen. In at least seven states there are election deniers on the ballot who could have a direct impact on voting systems. In a close election in 2024, those people could be key in deciding who wins the White House.One of those critical posts is a state's secretary of state. In the past it was a post that got very little attention in election campaigns. It was almost an afterthought and certainly not a position that would get national or even international press attention. So the fact that I found myself flying over the desert in a private plane interviewing Arizona's candidate for secretary of state this summer, is a telling indication of how this midterm election is different. In a world where election results are contested, the secretary of state suddenly becomes very important. They have the ability to change the way people are allowed to vote and even change the rules around the count. Trump fully understands the significance of this post - on 2 January 2021 he famously called Georgia's Secretary of State, Brad Raffensperger, and urged the Republican to "find" him an extra 11,780 votes so that Trump could win the state. Raffensperger denied Trump's request. Now the former president wants to make sure that he has allies in the job of secretary of state, so that if he runs in 2024, he can count on them to help him out. In the run-up to the midterm elections, money and attention, from both parties, is pouring into the secretary of state races in half a dozen battleground states. Which is why I spent the day, and a terrifyingly bumpy plane ride, with Mark Finchem. And also why he had a private jet at his disposal in the first place. Joe Biden won Arizona by a mere 10,000 votes. Finchem is a staunch election denier who believes Trump was robbed in the state and would like to overturn the 2020 result. If he's elected this November, he plans to ban voting by mail (the preferred choice of 80% of Arizona's electorate), ban early voting, and do away with electronic voting machines - all by 2024, the next presidential contest. He says he just wants to eliminate any chance for fraud.Inflation might get her to vote Trump againMeet the BBC's 'undercover voters'His critics say Finchem is a threat to democracy who wants to control the voting process in a way that could swing the vote in Republicans' favour. One Republican state representative has even broken with Finchem and is backing his Democratic opponent in the race. Finchem has a mix of charm and vehemence that is disarming. He told me he doesn't believe Democrats could ever win Arizona, not in 2020, not in 2022 and not in 2024. He is running against Democrat Adrian Fontes and appears well positioned to win the race. In September, a poll by OH Predictive Insights showed Finchem leading Fontes 40%-35%. So, a man who says the last election was rigged and who also doesn't believe Republicans can lose the state could well end up in charge of running elections. It's not hard to see where this could go. If Finchem, and other candidates like him around the country, change the voting system in ways that make it almost impossible for their side to lose, then, come 2024, Democrats, with some reason, won't trust the results either. They will say they were robbed of victory. It won't be many voting cycles before no one trusts election results here. As I travelled thousands of miles across the country it was clear both sides believe America's democracy is in peril, for very different reasons. Each side blames the other.There's no obvious solution to this spiral of mistrust. Across the nation I heard anger, anxiety, even talk of violence. We are watching these midterms so closely, in part because of the attack of January 6th and in part because they will help set the stage for whether Donald Trump runs again. 2024 is just around the corner. It is likely to be a tumultuous couple of years. </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Alexandra Fouché in London &amp; Hugo Bachega in Kyiv"><Text>A large fire on the only crossing between the occupied Crimean peninsula and Russia was caused by a lorry explosion, Russian officials say.A blast on the road section led to oil tankers on the rail section catching fire, before the road collapsed.Crimea was annexed in 2014 by Russia, which now uses the bridge to move military equipment into Ukraine. The official Twitter account of the Ukraine government responded to the fire by tweeting: "Sick burn."An adviser to Ukraine's President Zelensky, Mykhailo Podolyak, did not directly claim Ukrainian responsibility, but wrote: "Crimea, the bridge, the beginning."Everything illegal must be destroyed, everything stolen must be returned to Ukraine, everything occupied by Russia must be expelled."Meanwhile, the Ukraine defence ministry compared the bridge explosion to the sinking of Russia's Moskva missile cruiser in April."Two notorious symbols of Russian power in Ukrainian Crimea have gone down," it tweeted. "What's next in line?"The Russian foreign ministry said "the Kiev regime's reaction towards destruction of civilian infrastructure is a testament to its terrorist nature".LIVE UPDATES: Blast causes only Crimea-Russia bridge to collapseExcitement and fear in Ukraine after bridge blastIt is hard to exaggerate the significance, and symbolism, of seeing the bridge on fire. Opened by President Putin in 2018, it was meant to symbolise that Crimea was Russian.Russia has used the bridge to move military equipment, ammunition, and personnel from Russia to battlefields in southern Ukraine. As such, Ukrainian authorities said it was a legitimate target, as they vow to retake the peninsula.Any attack on Crimea, where the Russian army has a massive presence, will be seen as another massive humiliation for the Kremlin.     The bridge is particularly hated by Ukrainians. Social media in Ukraine erupted in celebration on seeing the fire - one day after Russian President Vladimir Putin turned 70. Road and rail traffic across the bridge has been suspended. Local authorities in Crimea say they will organise a ferry service between the Russian mainland and the peninsula.Russia's National Anti-Terrorism Committee said: "At 06:07 Moscow time today [03:07 GMT], an explosion was set off at a cargo vehicle on the motorway part of the Crimean bridge on the side of the Taman peninsula, which set fire to seven fuel tanks of a train that was en route to the Crimean peninsula. "Two motorway sections of the bridge partially collapsed."Crimean parliamentary speaker Vladimir Konstantinov blamed the explosion on "Ukrainian vandals, who have finally managed to reach their bloody hands to the Crimean bridge".He added the damage to the bridge would be "promptly restored, since it is not of a serious nature".President Putin has been briefed about the "emergency" on the bridge and has ordered a government inquiry, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, in comments quoted by Interfax news agency.A criminal investigation is also under way.The 19km (12-mile) bridge across the Kerch Strait, which cost £2.7bn to build, was opened by President Putin four years after Moscow illegally annexed Crimea. It is the longest bridge in Europe, and was hailed by Russian media as "the construction of the century". Russian officials previously claimed it was well protected from threats from air, land or water.The crossing is more than 100 miles from Ukrainian-held territory. One explosives expert told the BBC the fire was probably not caused by a missile."The lack of obvious blast / fragmentation damage on the road surface suggests that an air-delivered weapon was not used," he said.He said it was possible that "a well-planned attack from below may have been the cause"."I suspect explosives on the road bridge and train deck were initiated near simultaneously using coded radio command," he added.Ukraine claimed responsibility last month for a series of air strikes on Crimea over the summer, including an attack on Russia's Saky military base.Kyiv has the momentum in this conflict. The army has reclaimed large swathes of territory, forcing Russian troops to abandon long-held positions. Amid the losses, Moscow has begun a chaotic military mobilisation - which led to rare anti-war protests in Russia, and a huge exodus of military-age men.On Russian TV talk shows, presenters and studio guests have been expressing increasing doom and gloom about the situation. </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Hugo Bachega and John Simpson"><Text>Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky says Russian officials have begun to "prepare their society" for the possible use of nuclear weapons, but added he does not believe Russia is ready to use them. In an interview with the BBC, President Zelensky denied having urged strikes on Russia, claiming that an earlier remark had been mistranslated. "You must use preventive kicks," he said, referring to sanctions, "not attacks".In recent weeks, the Ukrainian army has recaptured large swathes of territory in a successful counter-offensive that has forced Russian troops to abandon long-held positions. In what Kyiv describes as Moscow's response to its defeats, President Vladimir Putin has incorporated four partially occupied regions of Ukraine.The annexations, widely dismissed as illegal, have raised fears of a possible escalation in the seven-month war. President Putin and other senior Russian officials have suggested that nuclear weapons - possibly smaller, tactical weapons - could be used to defend those areas, although Western officials say there has been no evidence Moscow is prepared to do so.Speaking in English at the president's office in Kyiv, President Zelensky said: "They begin to prepare their society. That's very dangerous. "They are not ready to do it, to use it. But they begin to communicate. They don't know whether they'll use or not use it. I think it's dangerous to even speak about it."Then, in Ukrainian, he said through a translator: "What we see is that Russia's people in power like life and thus I think the risk of using nuclear weapons is not that definite as some experts say, because they understand that there is no turning back after using it, not only the history of their country, but themselves as personalities." However, he denied having called for strikes on Russia during an online event on Thursday, saying the Ukrainian word he had used had been misunderstood. The initial comment was denounced by Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as "an appeal to start yet another world war", while Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said it demonstrated why Russia was right to launch its operation in Ukraine."After that translation," President Zelensky said, "they [the Russians] did their way, how it's useful for them, and began to retranslate it in other directions."The interview happened hours after US President Joe Biden said that the Russian threat to use nuclear weapons had brought the world closer to "Armageddon" than at any time since the Cuban Missile Crisis during the Cold War.President Zelensky said action was needed now, as Russia's threats were a "risk for the whole planet". Moscow, he claimed, had "made a step already" by occupying the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe's largest nuclear station which President Putin is trying to turn into Russian property.   Around 500 Russian troops were at the plant, he said, although the Ukrainian staff still operate it."The world can stop urgently the actions of Russian occupiers," President Zelensky said. "The world can implement the sanction package in such cases and do everything to make them leave the nuclear power plant."Empowered by sophisticated Western-supplied weapons, the Ukrainian army has made significant advances in the east and the south, reclaiming towns and villages even in areas the Kremlin claims are now part of Russia. President Zelensky said Russian forces were putting up a "good enough fight", but that Ukraine had received weapons - "I won't say we have enough now" - and soldiers were motivated to push forward.The Russian military's setbacks, a major embarrassment for President Putin, have sparked unusual criticism of the country's military.Amid the losses, President Putin announced the mobilisation of hundreds of thousands of reservists, which led to rare anti-war protests in Russia and to a huge exodus of military-age men.President Zelensky urged Russians to "fight for your body, rights and soul", saying: "Those mobilised kids now, they come with nothing. Without guns or armour. They are being thrown here like cannon fodder... If they want to be kebabs - fine, let them come. But if they are people after all and think that this is their lives, they have to fight. "Everything Putin is afraid of, and it's not the nuclear hit, he is afraid of his community," he said. He's afraid of his people. Because only those people are capable of replacing him nowadays. Take away his power. Give it to someone else."Asked whether President Putin could survive in an eventual Ukrainian win in the war, he said: "I don't care."</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Paul Adams"><Text>Ukraine is exploding with excitement this morning.Videos of the damaged Crimean bridge have spread like wildfire on social media; this is already being compared to the sinking of the Russian warship Moskva in April."The guided missile cruiser Moskva and the Kerch bridge - two notorious symbols of Russian power in Ukrainian Crimea - have gone down," tweeted Ukraine's ministry of defence."What's next in line, Russkies?" it went on.Ukraine's inventive social media activists are gleefully pumping out memes to celebrate the occasion. And Ukraine's second largest bank, Monobank, says it has already issued a new debit card design featuring the collapsed bridge.Oleksii Danilov, Secretary of Ukraine's National Security Council, wasn't the only one noting that the attack came just a day after Vladimir Putin's 70th birthday, tweeting a video of the damaged bridge next to Marilyn Monroe's famous performance of Happy Birthday, Mr President from 1962.The sense of excitement is palpable.Coming on the back of weeks of mostly good news from the battlefront, where Ukrainian forces continue to take back territory seized by Russia back in February and March, the sight of the crippled, burning bridge is a massive additional boost to morale.Bridge explosion 'the beginning', says Zelensky adviserHow was this done? Any number of theories are doing the rounds - from a Ukrainian special forces operation to the work of partisans in Crimea, a missile strike, or even a suicide bomb."This is a masterpiece of clandestine sabotage," a former senior British army explosives expert told me. "A well-planned attack from below may have been the cause," he said. "With structural demolition, you always plan a 'collapse mechanism' which lets the weight of the structure do the majority of the work."Ukrainian officials are giving little away, happy to apply the same level of ambiguity that followed a mysterious attack on the Russian airbase in Crimea in August.But the attacks on the Saky base and the bridge are all part of the same wider effort: to undermine Russia's ability to use Crimea as a launch pad for its war in southern Ukraine. The road and railway bridges are vital links in Russia's supply chain. Without them, Moscow will find it even harder to send troops and equipment to repel Ukraine's offensive north of Kherson.Kyiv is also saying to Moscow: Crimea is ours and eventually we are going to take it back. For all the giddy delight ricocheting across social media, some Ukrainians are anxious.This morning, we left the city of Zaporizhzhia, which is still in shock after Russian missile attacks on Thursday, which left at least 17 civilians dead.People there suspect that they are being punished by Russia as Moscow lashes out after its recent military failures. They fear the coming days may bring more. </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Merlyn Thomas"><Text>Haiti has asked for foreign military support to curb its gang violence crisis which has paralysed the country.The Haitian government authorised Prime Minister Ariel Henry to request armed help due to "the risk of a major humanitarian crisis". The US meanwhile urged its citizens in Haiti to leave due to the insecurity.A group of powerful gangs have blocked the country's main fuel terminal since September, crippling its basic supplies like water and food.It is not clear to whom the request for intervention has been sent to, and in what form the help would be given.The UN said it had not received an official request from Haiti's government."That being said, we remain extremely concerned about the security situation in Haiti, the impact its having on the Haitian people, on our ability to do our work, especially in the humanitarian sphere," said UN spokesperson, Stephane Dujarric.The US is also considering a request for a humanitarian corridor to restore fuel distribution within Haiti, according to state department spokesperson Vedant Patel.Mr Patel did not say where the troops to support this would come from.Varreux fuel terminal has been controlled and blockaded by a coalition of powerful gangs since last month, which has ground the whole country to a halt. Some hospitals have shut, while businesses and transport services stopped working in protest of destitution. Civil unrest escalated since Mr Henry announced an end to government fuel subsidies on 11 September, which sent petrol and diesel prices skyrocketing.Since then, protests and looting have intensified, with the capital, Port-au-Prince, at the heart of it. Food aid warehouses have been targeted, with an estimated $5m (£4.6m) worth of food aid lost in repeated attacks, according to Haiti's UN envoy. It is unclear whether the Haitian government request for foreign military intervention would mean the return of UN peacekeeping troops, after leaving five years ago. The UN's presence has left a mixed legacy in Haiti: its peacekeepers accepted partial responsibility for sparking a cholera epidemic more than a decade ago which killed about 10,000 people. Haiti's government said eight people had died on Sunday from cholera, for the first time in three years - raising concerns over the potential for a health crisis too. Of the many supplies that have been blocked by the country's gangs, clean water is a vital one - especially as cholera is spread via contaminated water. Haiti is one of the poorest countries in the world and has suffered a number of recent crises, most notably the assassination of its president, Jovenel Moïse, in July 2021 and a massive earthquake that left more than 2,200 people dead just a month later.Deaths are frequent, with more than 200 people killed in gang violence in Port-au-Prince in the space of just 10 days in July, according to figures from the UN.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Merlyn Thomas"><Text>Ukraine says two mass burial sites have been found in the recently-recaptured eastern town of Lyman, after Russian retreated.The Ukrainian governor of the Donetsk region, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said one burial site had about 200 individual graves containing civilian bodies.It was unclear how many bodies the second site held, but it may contain both soldiers and civilians, he said.The time and cause of death for the deceased is yet to be determined. The BBC was not able to independently verify the claims. Mr Kyrylenko, writing on Telegram, said officials had begun investigating both burial sites. He also asked people not to speculate on the details until the investigation was completed.Russia withdrew its troops from the strategic town of Lyman, in a significant setback for its campaign in eastern Ukraine. Lyman is in Donetsk - one of four partially-occupied Ukrainian regions which Moscow declared it was annexing. Ukraine and its Western allies have dismissed the move as an illegal land-grab.Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has previously accused Russia of deliberately killing civilians in other locations in Ukraine.Mr Zelensky said that mass graves were found this spring in Bucha, near the capital Kyiv, and also near Mariupol - the key south-eastern Ukrainian port now occupied by Russia since its invasion of Ukraine in February.Investigators and journalists found what appeared to be evidence of the deliberate killing of civilians in Bucha and other nearby areas.Ukrainian forces said they found mass graves and evidence that civilians had been killed after their feet and hands were bound.Hundreds of graves were also found outside the eastern city of Izyum days after Russian troops retreated, according to Ukrainian authorities. It is unclear what happened to the victims, but early accounts suggest some may have died from shelling and a lack of access to healthcare. </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Omar Wally"><Text>A red toy motorbike sits in the corner of Mariam Kuyateh's home gathering dust.It was meant for her 20-month-old son, Musa, but he passed away in September. He is one of the 66 children in The Gambia who are thought to have died after being given a cough syrup that had been "potentially linked with acute kidney injuries", according to the World Health Organization.No-one in the family touches Musa's toy - a reminder of what has been lost.His 30-year-old mother, who has four other children, was in tears remembering what had happened to her son.Sitting in her home in a suburb of The Gambia's largest city, Serrekunda, she explained that his sickness started as a flu. After he was seen by a doctor, her husband bought a syrup to treat the problem."When we gave him the syrup, the flu stopped, but it led to another problem," Ms Kuyateh said. "My son was not passing urine."She returned to the hospital and Musa was sent for a blood test, which ruled out malaria. He was given another treatment, which did not work, and then a catheter was fitted, but he did not pass urine.Finally, the small child was operated on. There was no improvement."He couldn't make it, he died."Earlier this week, the WHO issued a global alert over four cough syrups in connection with the deaths in The Gambia.The products - Promethazine Oral Solution, Kofexmalin Baby Cough Syrup, Makoff Baby Cough Syrup and Magrip N Cold Syrup - were manufactured by an Indian company, Maiden Pharmaceuticals, which had failed to provide guarantees about their safety, the WHO said.The Indian government is investigating the situation. The firm has not responded to a BBC request for comment.There is a lot of anger in The Gambia over what has happened. There are growing calls for the resignation of Health Minister Dr Ahmadou Lamin Samateh, along with the prosecution of the importers of the drugs into the country."Sixty-six is a huge number. So we need justice, because the victims were innocent children," Ms Kuyateh said.Five-month-old Aisha was another victim.Her mother, Mariam Sisawo, realised one morning that after having taken the cough syrup, her baby was not passing urine.On an initial visit to the hospital, the 28-year-old was told that there was nothing wrong with her daughter's bladder. It took two more trips there on consecutive days before Aisha was referred to a hospital in the capital, Banjul, which was 36km (22 miles) away from their home in BrikamaBut after five days of treatment there, she died."My daughter had a painful death. At a certain time when the doctors wanted to fix a drip on her, they could not see her veins. Myself and two other women in the same ward, we all lost our children."I have two sons and Aisha was the only girl. My husband was very happy to have Aisha and he still can't come to terms with her death." The Gambia does not currently have a laboratory capable of testing whether medicines are safe and so they have to be sent abroad for checking, Gambia health services director Mustapha Bittay told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme.But Ms Sisawo believes the government should be more vigilant."This is a lesson for parents, but the greater responsibility is with the government. Before any drugs get in to the country, they should be properly checked if they are fit for human consumption or not," she said.Isatou Cham was too distressed to talk about the death of her two-year-and-five-month-old son, Muhammed.She left the living room of their home in Serrekunda crying with her two other children.Muhammed's father, Alieu Kijera, explained what had happened to his little boy.He said he was taken to hospital when he had a fever and was unable to pass urine. But the doctors were treating Muhammed for malaria and his condition was getting worse.The medics then said he should be treated in neighbouring Senegal, where the health service is thought to be better, but while there was some improvement, it still did not save him.Mr Kijera is angry that his country does not have a good enough health system and he was forced to travel abroad. "If there was equipment and the right medicine, then my son and many other children could have been saved," he said.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="BBC News, author unspecified"><Text>The school district in Uvalde, Texas, has suspended its entire police force following protests by parents of children killed in a shooting there. The suspension will be indefinite, the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District (UCISD) said in a statement.Recent developments "have uncovered additional concerns with department operations", it added. Nineteen children and two teachers died in the attack at Robb Elementary School on 24 May.Police have been accused of botching the response to the fatal shooting.A July investigation into the shooting by the Texas legislature found "systemic failures and egregiously poor decision-making" by those involved in the response.The UCISD is responsible for supervising the security of schools in the Uvalde area, including Robb Elementary.The school district's police force consisted of five officers and one security guard, according to its website.Their officers were among the first of nearly 400 police to respond to the attack by a rifle-wielding 19-year-old gunman, who was eventually shot and killed by a border patrol agent.State troopers have been asked to help provide security for the school district, the UCISD statement said.There are still two ongoing investigations into the police response to the school shooting. It recently emerged that a police officer newly hired by the Uvalde school district is being looked into for her conduct on the day of the shooting, while she was working as a state trooper. Officer Crimson Elizondo was fired from the force on Thursday. Also on Friday, the acting district police chief was placed on administrative leave while the director of student services of the Uvalde school district announced his decision to retire.Parent of the shooting's victims have been camped outside school offices for days. They praised the district's decision to suspend the entire police force."They don't know how to hire people, they don't know how to vet officers," mother Kimberly Rubio, told ABC News, adding that the move to suspend the entire force is "what we've been asking for - it's more than we've been asking for".The former head of the police department for the school district, Pete Arredondo, was fired in August. He was one of the first officers on the scene that day, and received much of the blame for the botched response. The Texas Department of Public Safety has said that Mr Arredondo wrongly told officers under his command to treat the situation as if they were dealing with a barricaded gunman rather than an active shooter, which would have prompted a more urgent enforcement reaction. </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="BBC News, author unspecified"><Text>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has declared a state of emergency to address a "crisis situation" over an influx of migrants.More than 17,000 have arrived in the city from the southern border since April.Republican states like Texas, Arizona and Florida have been sending migrants to Democratic areas in recent months. It's part of a row with the White House as unprecedented numbers of people arrive at the US-Mexico border.Since September, an average of five to six buses have been arriving in the city each day, Mr Adams said at a press conference on Friday. He said that one in five people in the city shelter system is currently an asylum seeker. Many of those arriving are families with school-aged children and are in serious need of medical care, he said. The influx is on track to cost New York $1bn (£900m) this fiscal year, and the mayor is calling for federal and state funding to help with the costs. "New Yorkers are angry," said Mayor Adams. "I am angry too. We have not asked for this. There was never any agreement to take on the job of supporting thousands of asylum seekers."He added: "The city is going to run out of funding for other priorities. New York City is doing all we can, but we are reaching the outer limit of our ability to help."The city's social services are "being exploited by others for political gain", he added.Three states - Texas, Arizona and Florida  - have transported migrants to Democratic-led areas, focusing on self-proclaimed "sanctuary" cities that limit their co-operation with federal immigration authorities.Why are migrants being sent to Democrat-run areas?Republican officials in border states say the tactic is aimed at mitigating the impact of migration flows.They have also said the measure is designed to increase pressure on the administration of President Joe Biden to do more to reduce the number of migrants crossing the southern US border, which has hit a record high this year.The Democratic-run city of El Paso, Texas, has been offering migrants free rides to New York City and Chicago as a means of alleviating the strain on city resources. El Paso alone has transported more than double the number of migrants - nearly 9,000 - to the two northern cities than have been sent by the Texas governor.El Paso officials say the rides are voluntary, and that they co-ordinate with the destination cities to help the migrants upon arrival. As part of his emergency declaration, the New York mayor issued an executive order that allows the city to dedicate resources to support the asylum seekers and expedite any response efforts. A spokeswoman for Texas Governor Greg Abbott dismissed the declaration by the mayor on Friday."The true emergency is on our nation's southern border where small Texas border towns are overrun and overwhelmed by hundreds of migrants every single day as the Biden administration dumps them in their communities," said Renae Eze.Ms Eze said that, as of October, Texas had sent around 3,100 migrants arriving in the state to New York on more than 60 buses.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Patrick Jackson"><Text>A tractor is one of the odder gifts for Vladimir Putin, as Russia's president, a pariah in the West since his invasion of Ukraine, turns 70.It was given him by his Belarusian ally, Alexander Lukashenko, whose country boasts a tractor works.Mr Lukashenko confirmed the news as he visited his fellow strongman's home city, St Petersburg, for talks.Mr Putin was hosting other leaders of ex-Soviet states as the war fanned by his invasion raged.Faced with successful Ukrainian counter-attacks, he hinted at problems this week, describing the situation in regions he recently annexed as "restive".But on Friday, his allies lavished praise and gifts on the man who has led Russia, whether as president or prime minister, for more than two decades.Mr Lukashenko, Europe's self-styled "last dictator" who has been in power even longer than the Russian leader (since 1994) and whose administration is also under Western sanctions, came to St Petersburg with a gift certificate for the Belarusian-made vehicle.Belarus, Ukraine, Russia activists win Nobel prizeThe Minsk Tractor Works is the flagship of Belarusian industry.It was not immediately clear how Mr Putin responded to the big-wheeled gift, which had to compete with mountains of melons and watermelons from Tajikistan's President, Emomali Rahmon.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterHowever, it is a fact that Mr Putin has been frequently seen in tractors for some years now.Along with the gifts came praise for Mr Putin for "transforming the image of Russia, strengthening its sovereignty and its defence capability, and protecting its national interests", in the words of the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill."The number one patriot in the world" was how Ramzan Kadyrov, Chechnya's Moscow-backed leader, put it.Further afield, but dealing with similar international isolation, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un congratulated the man in the Kremlin for "crushing the challenges and threats of the United States".Mr Putin's enemies used the occasion of his birthday again to depict him as a war criminal trying to destroy another country while ruining his own.Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov called on Russia's military to reject him and refuse to fight his war, saying Mr Putin was "hiding in a bunker rather than standing" with his soldiers.Some social media users noted the irony of Mr Lukashenko's gift to Mr Putin: the humble tractor became an early symbol of Ukrainian resistance to the Russian invasion after farmers were seen towing away abandoned military vehicles.     In the Czech capital, Prague, demonstrators mocked Russia's president with a giant dummy depicting him as a naked emperor sitting on a golden toilet.  </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="BBC News, author unspecified"><Text>A jailed Belarus activist and two groups from Ukraine and Russia have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for championing human rights and democracy.The decision to honour Ales Bialiatsky, Russia's Memorial and the Ukrainian Centre for Civil Liberties (CCL) is a rebuff to two authoritarian leaders.Russia forced Memorial to close last December, ahead of Vladimir Putin's decision to invade Ukraine.Bialiatsky was imprisoned amid protests against Belarus's Alexander Lukashenko.Ukraine's CCL has monitored political persecutions and crimes against humanity in areas of the country occupied or annexed by Russia.Norwegian Nobel Committee head Berit Reiss-Andersen told reporters that all three had made "an outstanding effort to document war crimes, human right abuses and the abuse of power".Asked whether the committee was sending a signal to Russia's leader on his 70th birthday, she pointed out that the Nobel prize was always awarded "for something and to somebody and not against anyone".Belarus's long-time ruler is a close ally of President Putin. After a re-election in 2020 that was widely condemned as rigged, he brutally cracked down on protesters and then allowed Russian forces to use his country as a launchpad in its war against Ukraine.ANALYSIS: Putin's dream of victory slips away in UkraineAles Bialiatsky, 60, founded Belarus rights group Viasna, which means spring, in 1996, two years after Mr Lukashenko came to power. He was first jailed in 2011, then last year, he was detained again without charge. He is one of 1,348 people who Viasna says are currently held as political prisoners in Belarus.Exiled opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya praised the Nobel committee's "recognition for all Belarusians fighting for freedom and democracy" and Bialiatsky's wife Natallia Pinchuk said she was "overwhelmed with emotion".A foreign ministry spokesman in Minsk said Alfred Nobel was "turning in his grave" following the decision to hand Bialiatsky the Nobel Peace Prize.Memorial is one of the oldest human rights groups in Russia. Led initially by another Peace Prize laureate, Andrei Sakharov, in the late 1980s, its work uncovered the true scale of Joseph Stalin's repression in the form of Gulag camps of forced labour, where tens of millions of people are thought to have died.But it went on to document more recent human rights abuses, including kidnappings and torture in the Russian republic of Chechnya. The head of its Chechen branch, Natalia Estemirova, was murdered in 2009. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterIn December 2021, Russia's Supreme Court liquidated Memorial, although it continues to operate in a harsh climate where criticism of the war in Ukraine is considered a criminal offence.The head of International Memorial, Elena Zhemkova, told the BBC that the Nobel prize would help their work: "We always said at Memorial that memory of the past and human rights have no boundaries. To understand the Soviet past demands joint efforts. No country can privatise the memory about the war and repression."However, officials in Moscow were less impressed. The head of Russia's human rights council, Valery Fadeyev, urged Memorial to reject the prize, describing it as completely discredited, Tass news agency reports.Although a Ukrainian organisation was jointly awarded the peace prize, there was some annoyance in Kyiv that it was shared with representatives of Belarus and Russia. "Neither Russian nor Belarusian organisations were able to organise resistance to the war. This year's Nobel is 'awesome'," tweeted presidential adviser Mikhailo Podolyak sarcastically.Ukraine's Centre for Civil Liberties has in recent months turned its attention to abuses committed by Russian forces, after spending the previous years documenting political persecution in Russian-annexed Crimea and crimes in areas of eastern Ukraine run by Russian-backed separatists.The centre's head, Oleksandra Matviychuk, said she was delighted they were sharing the prize with "our friends and partners at Memorial and Viasna". In order to give the hundreds of thousands of victims of war crimes a chance of justice, she said an international tribunal should be created to "bring Putin, Lukashenko and other war criminals to justice". </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Mark Lowen in Rome and Elsa Maishman in London"><Text>Central heating will be restricted in Italy this winter, as it becomes the latest country to take action on European gas supply shortages sparked by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Under a new government decree, buildings will face an extra fifteen days without central heating. Italians will also be told to turn their heating down by one degree, and off for an extra hour a day. Some buildings will be exempt, including nurseries and hospitals.The move comes as governments across Europe look to reduce demand and shore up energy supplies ahead of winter. Many were dependent on gas from Russia, which has been restricted following the war in Ukraine. Before February's invasion, Italy was the second-largest importer of Russian gas in the EU, with imports making up 40% of its total supply. This is now down to just 10%, as Rome has turned to other sources of energy and liquified natural gas. The country normally restricts the use of central heating in warmer months, with its use determined by regional governments. With bills already soaring, reactions from Italians have been mixed."For old people who will stay at home a lot of time, probably it will be a problem for them," one told the BBC."It's probably needed, but it's hard. Now that this crisis is affecting us personally, it could lead more people to change their view on still backing sanctions on Russia," said another.How are countries tackling energy bills? EU leaders consider how to cap gas pricesHow can the world cope without Russian oil and gas?Many European governments have announced similar energy-saving plans. In France, homes and offices will be heated to a maximum of 19C, there will be no hot water in public buildings, and the temperature in swimming pools and gyms will also be reduced. A ban on doors being left open in heated or air-conditioned shops, which was previously in effect in some areas, has been extended nationwide. Spain has also previously mandated that heating not rise above 19C, as well as ordering that doors should be closed so as not to waste heat and that lights in shop windows must be turned off after 22:00.And Germany has stopped lighting up public monuments and buildings for aesthetic reasons, and warned heating may be turned off in the entrances, corridors and foyers of public buildings. At an EU summit in Prague on Friday, leaders are discussing capping wholesale gas prices to protect consumers.Many individual states have already introduced national caps on the price consumers pay for units of energy. Other measures have already been agreed across the bloc, including windfall taxes on surplus profits made by fossil fuel companies, and a levy on excess profits made by non-gas electricity producers.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Nathan Williams"><Text>A fire has damaged the enigmatic statues on Easter Island, with some of the charring said to be irreparable. An unknown number of the stone-carved statues have been affected by the blaze, Chile's cultural heritage undersecretary said.Easter Island has nearly 1,000 of the megaliths, known as moai. They have oversized heads and generally stand about 4m (13ft) high. They were carved by a Polynesian tribe more than 500 years ago. The fire, which broke out on Monday, affected nearly 60 hectares (148 acres), cultural heritage official Carolina Perez Dattari tweeted.It is reported to have been started deliberately, and is centred around Easter Island's Rano Raraku volcano - which is a Unesco World Heritage Site.Easter Island lies 3,500km (2,174 miles) off the coast of Chile. It relies on tourism and reopened just three months ago following its closure during the Covid-19 pandemic. The site has now been closed again while a conservation team examines the extent of the damage.The island's Mayor, Pedro Edmunds, told local media: "The damage caused by the fire can't be undone." The are some 1,000 giant stone statues and carvings on Easter Island, the largest of which weigh 74 tonnes and stand 10m tall.The figures were carved by the indigenous Rapa Nui people sometime between the years of 1400 and 1650, and positioned to form a ring around the island, facing inland.They were figures of spiritual devotion for the Rapa Nui, embodying the spirit of a prominent ancestor. Each one was considered to be the person's living incarnation.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Guy Hedgecoe"><Text>Spanish prosecutors are investigating a group of male university students filmed chanting obscene misogynistic abuse at female students in Madrid.Videos have circulated for days of abuse being hurled from the windows of an all-male student building late on Sunday at women in the block opposite.Spanish PM Pedro Sánchez criticised the "macho, inexplicable, unjustified and absolutely repugnant behaviour". It has drawn political condemnation and triggered widespread debate. One student shouted: "Whores, come out of your holes, bunnies. You are a load of nymphomaniac whores."Then, in a choreographed move, fellow students across the Colegio Mayor Elías Ahuja building pulled opened their blinds and started shouting and making animal noises. As Sunday night's video of students from Complutense University went viral, there was an immediate backlash from politicians across the spectrum.Socialist party prime minister Mr Sánchez said: "We should not give any excuse for these behaviours which surely don't represent the general feeling of Spanish society."I think it's important that all political parties and the media express a clear 'no' to these macho behaviours, and do not give a take a single step back on real equality between men and women."The leader of the conservative opposition Popular Party, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, called for society "to finish with these intolerable sexist attitudes".  Madrid's public prosecutor has opened an investigation to decide whether the incident amounts to a hate crime. The scandal has left the Elías Ahuja residence under national scrutiny. In a statement it said the episode had been "incomprehensible and inadmissible" and "contrary to the ideas and values" of the institution. It has expelled the alleged ringleader and said that others involved will attend a course on gender equality.  However, some of the residents of the Santa Mónica all-female building, which was the target of the abuse, have apparently defended the male students implicated and claimed that the incident has been blown out of proportion.  A statement attributed to residents of the Santa Mónica accommodation said: "Despite the seriousness of their words, this is a practice which is a tradition between university residences, which has created an impression of hate and sexism which could not be further from reality."It was not clear how many female residents supported the statement, which was posted on social media. And others have given a very different view. Ángela Ruiz, a former resident of Santa Mónica, wrote: "I was one of those 'Mónica whores' and I heard these kinds of shouts EVERY DAY for the two years I was at the residence."  This affair comes as Spain's coalition government has been making efforts to promote gender equality and eliminate violence against women. In May, congress approved legislation, known as the "Only yes means yes law", making it easier for victims of sexual violence to prosecute their assailants by emphasising the importance of consent.  A study last year found that one in five young Spanish men did not believe that gender violence existed, instead seeing it as an "ideological invention". Meanwhile, another disturbing video apparently of the Elías Ahuja residence from several years ago has been circulating. In it, students are shown making what appears to be a Nazi salute as they sing the words "Sieg Heil". </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="BBC News, author unspecified"><Text>In our series of letters from African journalists, Ismail Einashe meets some Kenyan musicians with a cult following who are challenging the status quo.Crystal Axis, a five-piece Afro-punk band, has established itself as one of the leading group on Kenya's burgeoning rock music scene. I find them rehearsing in a recording studio at the International Trade Fair Grounds, on the outskirts of the Kenyan capital, Nairobi.One of the guitarists plays distorted riffs on his instrument with a scratchy, heavy sound as the drummer energetically beats his drums. The group is made up of Ahmed Bulhan, known as AB, on vocals, Djae Aroni and Fox Elijah on guitar, Doug Kihoro on bass and Dan Gichia on drums and percussion.Their origin lies in Nairobi's late noughties alternative music scene, which had a number of bands performing everything from indie rock and punk to heavy metal. At the time Aroni was at school when one night he snuck out of home to see a post-hardcore band, Jack the Hammer. The lead singer and guitarist happened to be Elijah. Seeing Elijah rocking it out on stage in his black skinny jeans, classic Vans and fierce punk attitude had an impact - and the next day Aroni went to school and told his friends he wanted to start his own rock band. Shortly afterwards in 2009 he set up Crystal Axis and was soon joined by AB, with Elijah and Kihoro joining in 2017 and Gichia last year.Growing up as teenage rockers and performing while still in secondary school posed its problems, says Aroni.They had to dodge bouncers at clubs who demanded to see their IDs: "We literally had to bribe our way into our own gigs."Unlike most young Kenyans who are into Afrobeats or hip-hop, the raw energy of punk rock was their inspiration.For Aroni it came from watching US group Green Day's live film Bullet in a Bible and seeing lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong holding his crotch while gyrating wildly on stage. He thought to himself then: "This is what I want to do."His bandmate Kihoro was inspired by listening to Scandinavian death metal, while drummer Gichia honed his musical skills in his teens playing in a local Christian rock band. In 2017 the band released their first major EP, Leopold - a commentary on the mass colonial atrocities committed by King Leopold II of Belgium in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo. Since then they have released three more EPs that have garnered them a devoted following in Kenya and internationally - people drawn to their bold, infectious and distinctly punk rock sound. Their lyrics, in English and a smattering of Swahili, are highly political and delve into everything from colonial history and corruption to racism. "[We want to] tell African stories from an African perspective," Aroni says.Their hit single Nyayo House addresses the legacy of Daniel arap Moi, Kenya's longest-serving president, who led what became known as the "Nyayo regime". The raging lyrics shine a light on a harrowing aspect of Kenyan oppression and are an indictment of an era when there was no freedom of expression in the East African nation.Nyayo House is a high-rise government building in central Nairobi infamous for its torture chambers used for opponents of Moi, who was in power from 1978 to 2002. "We are dissidents… Nyayo is sickening," scream the lyrics of the song, which AB says is about "generational trauma" and the need for Kenyans to speak about this history. In August Crystal Axis released their latest EP, Black AF, a celebration of contemporary African identities.It draws on their own experiences as young black Africans who contend with various challenges such as corruption, but is also a celebration of their strength, talent and creativity. The band also wants to use the power of punk rock music to create a space for young Kenyans to make this music on their own terms.Another aspiration is to reclaim punk rock history, which they say has been "whitewashed" and the contribution of black punk artists often forgotten. Aroni gives the example of black pioneers like Death, a proto punk band founded in Detroit in 1971, which tends not to be credited for its development of the early punk sound.In the late 1970s punk heyday other black bands also played an important role in the explosive growth of the genre with groups such as Pure Hell, formed in Philadelphia in 1974, and X-Ray Spex, formed in London in 1976 by the Somali-British punk pioneer Poly Styrene.As part of their efforts to challenge the image of punk rock music as a genre dominated by white, male bands, Crystal Axis was meant to play at the Decolonise Fest in the UK last month.The festival celebrates punk music by people of colour, but the band members were denied visas to enter the UK - much to their outrage and disappointment as they had sold out shows in Leeds, Manchester and London. But this has not dented their ambition - and they see punk rock as a powerful means to channel their rage, intellectual curiosity, joy and hopes.In the recent Kenyan elections the majority of the band members did not vote, with Kihoro saying Kenyan politics is "full of old men".Aroni agrees, adding that most young Kenyans feel powerless to alter the political landscape: "We are disenfranchised. There's nothing we can do."Yet Crystal Axis' lyrics are a warning that young people should not be ignored.Their 2020 song Take The Throne about "over policing" in Kenya and the violence of the state explodes with words: "Send your soldiers, send your mob. We're 50 million, and we're tenfold strong."Rip it down! We'll build again from scratch.

It focussed its attention on two permanent members of the UN Security Council: China and Russia.The Human Rights Council is the world's top human rights body. Its mandate is to promote human rights everywhere, to condemn violations everywhere, without fear or favour.The council has done some excellent work. Its commission of inquiry for Syria has produced painstaking, forensic reports several times a year since that long conflict began in 2011. The fact-finding mission for Myanmar reported in graphic detail the suffering of the Rohingya community, and made it clear that Myanmar's ruling junta were responsible.Of course, no country, big or small, likes sitting on the council's naughty step, and they all try to avoid it. But some succeed, and others do not.  This week, China succeeded, to the bitter disappointment of human rights groups.In August, minutes before she left office, the outgoing UN Human Rights Commissioner Michelle Bachelet finally published her report on violations against Uyghur Muslims in China's Xinjiang province. As many rights activists had predicted, it contained evidence of widespread abuse, from arbitrary detention, to forced labour, to torture. Abuse which could amount, Ms Bachelet said, to crimes against humanity.Torture claims against China Uyghurs credible - UNWho are the Uyghurs? 'Don't turn a blind eye to Uyghur suffering'The logical next step after a report like that is a debate at the Human Rights Council, the appointment of a special expert to monitor the country concerned, or even a full-blown commission of inquiry. Western diplomats, led by the US and the UK, took a minimalist approach and asked only for a debate, and they lost.China lobbied hard, especially among African countries which have benefitted from Beijing's investment. Its ambassador suggested most of the world was weary of the west's "political manipulation". It's us today, he told developing nations, it will be you tomorrow. When the votes were counted, just 17 member states supported a debate, 19 rejected it, and 11 abstained. Just one African country - Somalia - said yes. Most, from Mauritania, to Senegal, to Ivory Coast and Cameroon, backed China.The vote reflects China's position as a global superpower, able to influence smaller UN member states who may rely on it for economic support. But it also, as the next vote about Russia showed, reveals deep divisions about what human rights are, and who should be defending them.Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Moscow's diplomats, who once strode purposefully from meeting to meeting at the United Nations in Geneva, have been increasingly isolated. Russia was ousted from its seat on the Human Rights Council last March, and can now only participate as an observer. When this week's resolution to appoint a UN special rapporteur to monitor human rights in Russia came up for discussion, Western diplomats and rights activists were confident it would be approved.The crackdown on dissent in Russia has become ever more brutal, with mass arrests, beatings and the suppression of independent media. Russian human rights groups bravely continuing their work were looking to the UN for support.Like the resolution on China, the proposal on Russia went to a vote, and this time it was passed. "Happy 70th birthday, Mr Putin," tweeted one jubilant Western diplomat. But examine the votes, and there really is not much for the West to celebrate. Just 17 council members voted in favour, six said no, and a staggering 24 abstained. Again and again countries who abstained - India, Pakistan, Mexico, Armenia, Honduras - argued that finger pointing was not constructive. Dialogue please, they said, not blame. Sovereign countries need to deal with these issues themselves, it was suggested, without unwanted interference from do-gooders in the West.These arguments have been taking place at the UN Human Rights Council for years, but never have they been so stark. Human rights, or so the declaration of 1948 says, are supposed to be universal. The Human Rights Council is mandated to uphold, promote and defend them, and to call out violations. The member states on the council are supposed to work together, the common aim of universal human rights for all is supposed to take precedence over national interests, and geopolitical differences.Increasingly, that idea, created by those who had endured the horrors of World War Two, including Russia and China, looks like a fantasy. Powerful countries can use their power to avoid scrutiny, less powerful ones will join together to argue that they don't need any outside interference. The losers, rights groups say, will be not only the thousands of people who suffer repression and abuse, but all of us.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Sam Cabral"><Text>US cannabis policy has been thrust to the fore after President Joe Biden issued a blanket pardon for Americans federally convicted of possessing small amounts of the drug.Mr Biden also urged governors to do likewise on state offences and called for a review on whether cannabis should be listed as a less serious drug.Federal law currently classifies cannabis as a Schedule I controlled substance, meaning it has "no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse".As one White House official noted, that's "the same schedule as for heroin and LSD, and it's even higher than the classification for fentanyl and methamphetamine - the drugs that are driving [America's] overdose epidemic"."It makes no sense," Mr Biden said on Thursday, as he directed his attorney general and health secretary to oversee a review."Too many lives have been upended because of our failed approach to marijuana. It's time that we right these wrongs."The news came as a surprise to many, but it has set cannabis stocks ablaze. Advocates say the move is a first - albeit overdue - step to bringing a $33bn (£30bn) industry out of the shadows and providing relief to those impacted by a "war on drugs" that began in the 1970s."It's a welcome conversation starter," said Kassandra Frederique, executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance non-profit."We've been waiting for some action around cannabis reform federally, so we welcome the opportunity to use it for a much broader conversation about reform."As the White House itself has noted, Mr Biden's pardons - for "simple possession" - are limited in scope. Only about 6,500 people with federal convictions and some District of Columbia (DC) residents are eligible for the relief.That's because, while nearly 29 million Americans have been arrested for cannabis-related violations since 1965, nobody is currently in federal prison solely for possession. In addition, most convictions for possession are at the state and local level, and presidential pardons only apply to federal charges.Ms Frederique argues, however, that the president's actions have "put teeth behind" efforts to relieve the perceived harms of cannabis prohibition.Organisations like hers are calling on the president to de-schedule the drug - that is, repeal cannabis from the US Controlled Substances Act of 1970 and regulate it in the same way as alcohol or tobacco."Without de-scheduling, people are going to keep facing criminal charges and be denied federal benefits; marijuana research will continue to face hindrances; veterans won't be able to access medical cannabis programmes; federal employees can still be fired for using cannabis; entrepreneurs and businesses will not have access to funding; and, banks will continue to be hesitant to offer loans," Ms Frederique said.If the Biden-initiated review does ultimately call for re-classifying cannabis, the federal government will be catching up to reforms already underway in several US states.Currently, 37 states and DC have legalised medical cannabis, while 19 states have approved the drug for recreational use. That represents well over 40% of the US population.Voters in five more states - Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota and South Dakota - will cast ballots next month on whether to allow recreational cannabis use, with at least four more ballot referendums expected in 2023 and 2024.It is a reflection of how much the politics of cannabis reform have changed over a short period of time. A Gallup poll last year showed that a record 68% of Americans are now in favour of legalising the drug.And, while Democrats and independents are far more likely to support loosening restrictions on cannabis use, about half of Republicans are also on board, the poll shows.Reacting to Mr Biden's announcement on Thursday, Republican congresswoman Nancy Mace of South Carolina gave "credit where credit is due"."I don't always agree with the Biden administration, I've been very vocal about that, but this is a step in the right direction," Ms Mace told the Fox Business Network.In fact, Mr Biden's actions represent an about-face on his own track record as a lawmaker. He claims to have never touched cannabis and, over a 35-year tenure in the US Senate, authored and voted in favour of many tough-on-drug laws.Industry experts expect that broad praise for his Thursday announcement will benefit the president and his party in midterm elections next month that threaten Democrats' control of Washington."Moving to repeal the federal prohibition of marijuana isn't just good policy. It's good politics," Paul Armentano, deputy director of the National Organisation for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) advocacy group, told the BBC.He argued that, by engaging with the matter from his bully pulpit, the president is "taking an issue that has been seen politically as a fringe issue, and has legitimised it".But it is only Congress - not the president - who can unilaterally act to amend or repeal cannabis prohibition.Bills to de-schedule cannabis and to ease the financial burdens on cannabis retailers have passed this year in the US House of Representatives - but none of these efforts have advanced in the upper chamber of Congress. That is in spite of vocal backing for certain measures by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who holds the power to bring bills to the floor but has been unable to garner enough support. "By having the most powerful elected politician in this country talking about marijuana policy and taking steps to impact marijuana policy, that has elevated this debate," said Mr Armentano."He has squarely put the pressure back on Congress, where it belongs, and said: it's up to you to finish the job."</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Laura Bicker in North-east Thailand &amp; Frances Mao in Singapore"><Text>Duangphan Patphaothanun is wandering outside a childcare centre, clutching a bag full of toys. The 64-year-old grandmother wants to know when she can see her grandson, so she can place his most treasured possessions with him in his coffin - the bag includes a large plastic dinosaur. Three-year-old Pattarawut is among the 23 children who died on Thursday in a gun and knife attack at a childcare centre in Thailand's north-east. A former policeman had stormed the building, killing children as young as two while they slept, leaving at least 37 people dead. More than 90 children usually attend the centre but because of poor weather and a bus breakdown only 24 of them were there on Thursday. Only one child has survived.Police say the 34-year-old attacker - a local named Panya Kamrab - killed his wife and his step-son, before killing himself after a manhunt. His step-son used to attend the centre but hadn't been for the past month. The motive for the attack is not yet known. But police said Kamrab was fired from his job in June for drug use. "When I heard the news about the shooting, I just fainted," Duangphan said. On her phone are photos of Pattarawut, taken just hours before the shooting. Like many childcare centres, this one too regularly posts photo updates for parents to see - the images show happy, smiling faces, writing or finishing a drawing. Duangphan was one of several grieving relatives who had gathered outside the centre in Nong Bua Lamphua province on Friday morning. Another grandmother, 46-year-old Nipha Lawongsechaison, says she lost both a grandson and granddaughter in the attack."I am full of such pain... [and] anger because I cannot do anything," she says. She's not the only one. Others too say they are filled with grief - and unanswered questions. "Why did he take it [out] on the children? Why kill them when they did nothing to him?" says 27-year-old Naliwan Dungkhet, whose two-year-old nephew Captain also died in the attack. He was just a month away from his third birthday. 'It's shocking' - witnesses describe nursery attack horrorThai pre-school attack: What we knowAmong the mourners was Komsan Norraburh. His ex-wife married the attacker who killed both her and Norraburh's three-year-old son, Worraphat."I was at the factory [when] my friend asked me to check the news. I called my ex-wife and son to see if they were ok but no-one answered," he said. "He was a good boy who liked to talk a lot. I'm waiting to pick up his body and see his face one last time."Many of the relatives said they had waited outside the childcare centre well into the night on Thursday, while others gathered at the police station.They would eventually be greeted by the sight of pink and white coffins adorned with gold, bearing the bodies of the children, which were brought to a hospital morgue in Udon Thani and laid out in rows. Police said the armed attacker broke into the building just after lunch time on Thursday, shooting his way past a teacher and parent outside. He was recognised by one of the teachers when he burst in.Witnesses said he first shot staff - including a teacher who was eight months pregnant- before forcing his way past teachers into a room where children were napping. He then stabbed most of his victims before fleeing.Officers who rushed to the nursery were confronted with the bodies of adults and children, lying inside and outside the building. Kamrab had appeared in court the morning of the attack on charges related to the use and possible sale of methamphetamine. He had been due to face a verdict on Friday.Mass shootings in Thailand are rare, although gun ownership rates are relatively high for the region. In 2020 a soldier killed 29 people and injured dozens more in the city of Nakhon Ratchasima. Thursday's attack comes less than a month after an army officer shot dead two of his colleagues at a base in Bangkok.Additional reporting by Suchada Phoisaat</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Stephen McDonell"><Text>The idea was to have China in stable and tip-top shape when thousands of delegates gather in Beijing to usher in a historic third term in power for Xi Jinping.However, the coronavirus is not playing nicely.In recent weeks, tens of millions of people have again been confined to their homes in lockdowns across 60 towns and cities and this is bringing political pressure on the man who has become the most powerful Chinese figure since the first Communist-era leader Mao Zedong.The government's ongoing "Dynamic zero-Covid" strategy is inextricably linked to Mr Xi. Its success is his success. Its failure? Well, it would be a brave person who tried to pin it on him.Elsewhere, vaccine rollouts have meant learning to live with the virus, but this one major economy stands alone, clinging to a response designed to quash every outbreak.Strict lockdowns, mass testing, constant scanning of health codes and travel restrictions have stopped China's hospitals from being swamped. But it's come at a cost - official youth unemployment stands at 18.7%. Earlier this year it was nudging 20%. Yet even in the face of significant economic and societal pressure, the government has not really turned to the one thing which might hasten an end to the crisis. While it has been prepared to enforce strict compliance in all other areas of Covid policy, it has not pushed vaccination with anywhere near the same enthusiasm.There is no compulsion to be vaccinated. There's barely a public awareness campaign.And it has stubbornly limited vaccination to locally developed vaccines only when research shows they are not as efficient as those produced internationally. It really does look like national pride trumping science.To an extent, this superpower is getting by. Nearly a fifth of the earth's population are, in one way or another, going about their daily lives inside a giant bubble. But they are doing this while people's livelihoods are being smashed.This week, rail services out of Xinjiang were suspended and many parts of the western region including its capital Urumqi were under lockdown as officials admitted they had failed to stop the virus spreading. China's stricter lockdowns have seen widespread reports of people unable to source food and medicine - but zero-Covid is affecting people's daily lives in myriad other ways too.Three years into the crisis, this is exhausting the population.On the outskirts of Beijing, workers on modest incomes live in an area called Yanjiao because the rent is cheaper. It is on the other side of a river, just inside neighbouring Hebei province.In normal times, this wouldn't matter but in the pandemic it can mean having to run the gauntlet of roadblocks to travel from where you live to where you work.In June this year, a cluster of cases saw people living in Yanjiao prevented from entering the capital, leading to clashes between police who were enforcing the border closure and employees trying to get to work.Since then, locals have been seen paddling across the water in inflatable craft to sneak into the city.At the time of writing, the border is open but everyone entering Beijing must show their IDs which are linked to health code apps.Every morning in Yanjiao, buses can be seen lined up, stopping before they cross over, so police can board and check that everyone has a clean bill of health.The delays have made the commuters of Yanjiao seem unreliable in the eyes of employers."Many people who live in this area got fired by their companies," said one woman in the queue for the bus. "And, if they find new work, they might get treated unfairly again."We take a train from Beijing to Xi'an. Upon arrival there is a huge logjam at the station, as thousands of travellers attempt to download the local health app after coming down the stairs from the platform. Then everyone has to do a new PCR test before leaving the station.Xi'an has been a driver of inland China's economy since the years when it was the start of the old Silk Road stretching across central Asia into the Middle East and Europe. These days, the city is supposed to be one of the county's top tourist draws.We meet Addison Sun, a specialist English-language tour guide and ask him how damaging the pandemic has been for his industry"Wow! For international tourism 100%," he says. "Because no one can come to China, no one can come to Xi'an."The number of domestic tourists prepared to travel is also way down. If you are visiting somewhere and a few coronavirus cases emerge, the city can be locked down. But even if it isn't, your own city can suddenly decide not to accept you back if you've been somewhere with infections. You're stranded, sometimes for an extended period, and you have to pay for your accommodation and other needs.There have been several stay-at-home lockdowns in Xi'an, one keeping 13 million people indoors for a month. So at times the sites at the home of the famed Terracotta Warriors have been empty.As his work stopped, Addison Sun says he slipped into depression."No income. This is my lowest point," he says. "And, you know, as a man, I couldn't do anything. I'd ask my wife, 'Hi darling can you give me 100 or 200 [yuan]'?"He pulled himself out of the mire one day when looking at his eight-year-old - "I have to stand up because I should be the model. I'm the hero for my daughter" - and began posting virtual tours of Xi'an online. He's now also teaching English but longs for the day when foreign tourists return.The city's Muslim Quarter, which historians say dates back to the Tang Dynasty, should be packed with visitors. Stallholders still line the streets calling out, advertising the kebabs and sweets they have, but their restaurants have very few customers. Along the narrow lanes the tarps blow in the wind where shops have closed."I paid two years rent the day before the lockdown," says Zhang Min, who runs a little shop selling the belts and bags she makes.  "We're from the countryside. We just wanted to achieve something by ourselves."She breaks down describing how she had hoped to give her mother a better life. When does she think things will get back to normal? "It's hard to know," she says. "Outbreaks come again and again."For decades, China's economic transformation has been powered by exports, but zero-Covid means some overseas buyers are sourcing their products elsewhere because of fears of disruption to China's supply chains.Dieshiqiao in Jiangsu Province, just north of Shanghai, is a hub for the clothing industry.At a small factory, staff are hunched over their sewing machines, furiously making up for an entire season of lost production following a lockdown.The bosses had started to explain their recent challenges when a man walks in and starts secretly filming us on his phone. He then goes and speaks to the owners - the interview is off."I'm really sorry. We just can't do it," says one of the company owners. While people here are legally entitled to be interviewed, who would defy the Communist Party in this way? Five reasons why China's economy is in troubleBefore the pandemic, China's growth was around 6%. Its most recent GDP figure was 0.4%. The local government knows that zero-Covid is tanking the economy and doesn't want anyone speaking about it.In a small shop selling items for bedding, a woman tells us their sales are down by half.Then another woman suddenly appears in the shop, posing as a customer. "Hey what are you talking about?" she asks in an effort to appear genuinely curious.After we leave, she returns and questions the shop owners.One of the architects of the policy which has stopped the coronavirus from ripping through China is Professor Liang Wannian, head of the government's Covid expert panel.When we speak to him, he acknowledges that China's home-grown vaccines are not as effective at stopping infection as had been hoped, but says they do prevent severe illness and death.When does he thinks zero-Covid might come to an end? "It's hard to say," he replies. "Because one thing I am sure of is, we won't kill the virus any time soon. We're waiting for more effective medicines and more effective vaccines."A key blockage standing in the way of re-opening is the significant body of people who don't think it's safe to be vaccinated.The Chinese authorities are prepared to separate elderly grandparents and young children from their families and force them into quarantine centres or lock down entire cities for months, but vaccination doesn't feel like a priority. Some Chinese doctors have even been telling their patients that they should not get the shots. As a result many analysts don't believe that official statistics accurately reflect the true level of vaccination.Professor Liang knows there's a problem in this area."Many old people have underlying diseases. They reckon it won't be safe to get vaccinated. But in fact, it is safe. We need to get this message across," he says. It's a significant admission."China has been working on it but there's a lot of room for progress," he adds.Could zero-Covid be lifted after the Communist Party Congress in mid-October? "It's hard for me to answer that," he says with an awkward laugh. "I'm just a scholar".China has successfully minimised the impact of the virus - and if it re-opened tomorrow, the disease would spread like wildfire.But, at the moment, it feels like the government is just kicking the can down the road. Remaining cut off from the outside world is coming at a cost.There are no easy options, but China can't go on like this forever.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Paul Kirby"><Text>Across Europe, governments have been grappling with ways of protecting their consumers from rising energy bills, because the market has been hit by Russia's war in Ukraine.At an EU summit in Prague on Friday, 27 European leaders are being asked to back a cap on gas prices, even though several are wary of the idea.Fifteen countries want a Europe-wide limit imposed on the wholesale price of gas, while European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen agrees there should be some kind of temporary price cap.The recent explosions in Germany's Nord Stream 1 pipeline in the Baltic Sea were a clear illustration of how little European countries can now rely on Russian gas imports. Germany's gas network regulator has already warned that consumers are using more than in previous years and Italy has imposed limits on hours and temperatures for heating many buildings.Some countries warn that capping wholesale prices could affect the security of Europe's gas supply, as it would boost consumption. EU member states have already agreed other measures to protect consumers, with windfall taxes on surplus profits made by fossil fuel companies and a levy on excess profits made by non-gas electricity producers. They have also agreed on a mandatory 5% cut on peak electricity consumption.It's a start, but it's not long-term and not a structural reform. So what possible alternatives are there and could an EU price cap work?Many governments have already introduced national ceilings on the prices consumers pay for units of energy. But capping wholesale prices across the EU would be a major departure, and there are various ways of doing it.Ursula von der Leyen has proposed a series of measures to "dampen" the price paid for imports that she believes would not put supplies at risk.One of them involves negotiating a "corridor of prices" for imports from suppliers such as Norway and the US. Instead of a fixed price cap, an upper and lower price limit below current rates would be agreed with the countries involved.Norway has become the EU's biggest gas supplier since Russia launched its war - but Oslo believes imposing a maximum on wholesale gas prices will not solve Europe's biggest problem of having too little gas.Four EU countries want a "dynamic corridor" which would apply to all wholesale gas sales, not just those agreed with key suppliers. Poland, Belgium, Italy and Greece say a central value would be set and could be updated regularly in relation to the price of crude oil. The price could deviate from that value, perhaps by 5%.The Greek prime minister believes an upper limit that is not artificially low would not destabilise markets: "With high enough prices, suppliers will still send their gas to Europe, and consumers will still have reason to reduce their demand," says Kyriakos Mitsotakis.The head of the European Commission believes it is important to stop EU countries trying to outbid each other, as that only sends prices higher. She foresees joint purchasing of gas across a European energy platform, similar to how the EU bought Covid-19 vaccines. Another idea is to impose a temporary price cap on imported gas used to generate electricity. The advantage here is that this has already been tried in Spain and Portugal since June.The Iberian cap brought down the costs of wholesale electricity and saved households an average of 24.4% on their bills, according to one study, but apparently also led to increased demand. It is not clear if it could work more broadly.Italy wants to focus on replacing the existing Dutch-based TTF market hub, where prices have become increasingly volatile. Critics say the hub cannot properly assess the market value of LNG (liquefied natural gas) and can add 30% to the price of a commodity fast becoming increasingly important in Europe. EU energy commissioner Kadri Simson says work has begun on developing a "complementary EU price index" for LNG, but she has also raised the prospect of imposing a price cap purely on Russian gas. Until that alternative benchmark is up and running, Ursula von der Leyen suggests imposing a price limit on the TTF, to make clear that the EU is not ready to pay "whatever price" for gas.Last week, the German government forged ahead with a €200bn (£174bn) package to shield its businesses and consumers, bigger than any other EU country can afford.It went down very badly with several European partners. "We cannot divide ourselves according to the space in our national budgets, we need solidarity," complained Italy's outgoing prime minister, Mario Draghi.Part of the big German announcement is a gas price "brake", which would mean Berlin subsidising the actual market price. That is very different from a cap on the price paid to suppliers that each EU country would sign up to.The main risk, as European think tank Bruegel puts it, is that the German package could disrupt a European level playing field, with German business having a far greater chance of surviving the energy crisis than, say, Italian business.Two European commissioners, Paolo Gentiloni and Thierry Breton, said the German action raised the issue of how other countries with lesser resources could support their businesses and households. They want an EU-wide scheme similar to the low-cost loans provided in the Covid pandemic.French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire says Europe should respond with a lasting strategy that focuses on the principle of fair competition: "What is at stake is the competitiveness of our companies, the competitiveness of our industries."The problem for the EU is that it has an internal energy market with 27 states having a variety of energy mixes and they have to agree on a solution that works for all of them.Although the EU's storage facilities are about 90% full, the lack of Russian supplies means refilling them will prove hard. The International Energy Agency says if demand is not cut and Russian supplies are not replenished, then levels could drop to between 5% and 20%. It says EU gas demand will have to fall this winter by 9% on previous years to keep storage levels above a quarter."The most promising measure to actually bring down the average price is still the reduction of peak consumption," says Estonian minister Riina Sikkut.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Michael Dempsey"><Text>South Central Los Angeles is an area that has been tarnished with a troubled image. Both Hollywood and real-life crime stories have seen to that.Carlos Oyarbide, who teaches English Language Development in South Central LA, is all too familiar with its reputation as a regular visitor. "There's truth in the violent stereotype, but I choose to teach there. It is an immigrant hub with a great sense of loyalty and community. And that community has an entrepreneurial spirit."That spirit has been harnessed at Mr Oyarbide's school, Nava College Preparatory Academy. The school was the trial site for a scheme that has pitched using the metaverse to help teach English to students with a limited grasp of the language. The term metaverse is used to describe a series of virtual reality worlds that can be accessed through a browser or virtual reality (VR) headset.The idea behind the scheme is to harness the power of VR technology to bypass traditional teaching methods and plunge students into a world of possibility in a virtual universe.The idea that VR can be used to boost learning isn't new. In 2020, a study by business consultants PwC found that through the use of VR students could learn up to four times faster than in a traditional class setting.However, the falling price of VR headsets has now made them a more affordable teaching aid.For Mr Oyarbide, the possibility of sharpened focus among his easily distracted students had huge appeal. "I've been teaching for 12 years. If kids can figure out anything it is how not to pay attention! I wanted to try something different, do normal learning from books for one period and then switch to VR." In doing this, he discovered that a VR environment swept away the inhibitions of many of his students wrestling with learning a new language.He says the technique helped them practise their language skills without embarrassment.Typical tasks performed by his students inside the VR classroom involved building a shop while working out the English language required for signage and advertising.Students would usually use the VR equipment for two or three hours a week."They can feel intimidated speaking in English, but when it's just them and a VR avatar that's completely different." Despite the positive impact VR has had on his teaching methods, Mr Oyarbide is not a starry-eyed convert to the avalanche of metaverse hype typified by Facebook's rebranding as Meta.He says there is still great advantages to a traditional classroom setting. "The old approach to teaching through books does not go away. And you're not going to wear a headset for four hours a day. But it does allow you to reduce teacher talk and create a tangible space for a student's confidence to grow."Meanwhile, Marco Vargas's parents moved to Los Angeles from Guatemala. "I'm a first-generation everything - first-generation American and first-generation high school graduate. In high school I learnt how to navigate the education system and how to use resources by myself."As part of the first cohort to go through Nava, he missed the more modern VR headsets that are now used.Instead, Mr Vargas had a more stripped-down VR experience, using a cardboard viewer attached to a smartphone and Google software.Nevertheless, he says that his high school's embrace of technology was important for his own academic development.The immersive aspect of VR learning appeals to him, but he can also be critical of how his younger generation can take technology for granted after having it at their fingertips for so long. "Yes, we are digital natives, but we lack discipline. We fall prey to distractions." Proving that he could overcome any distraction, Mr Vargas won a Fulbright scholarship to study at Dartmouth, a prestigious Ivy League university.More technology of business:How to make movies without a huge carbon footprintHigh and low-tech ways to solve India's water crisisAre we falling in love with robots?Can drumming reconnect you to your colleagues?How graphene's superpowers could soon be unleashedToday, he works for Exponential Destiny, a non-profit organisation dedicated to introducing students at schools in disadvantaged areas to emerging technologies. It was Exponential Destiny that provided the VR headsets to Nava College.Marcus Shingles runs the firm. He was a high-flying business consultant at top-tier firms where he demonstrated new technologies to business leaders, and happily contrasts himself with his students."I'm a rich white guy," he says. Now, he is helping to plot routes into technology for teenagers who had previously never considered that such a career could be possible for them. "It's clear that the internet is evolving, so we take the time students have invested in mastering platforms like TikTok and show them that developing products in the metaverse doesn't require hard coding."He says the falling price of VR headsets is a chance to make the technology more accessible.  This approach to embedding metaverse technologies in teaching attracts students who don't see themselves as tech-oriented.Many of the students that have gone through Exponential Destiny are hired to help out at other schools and expand the scheme.Samantha Aguilar Araujo, the daughter of Salvadoran parents and the first in her family to attend high school, is one of them."I didn't consider myself a tech person, I'm definitely more on the creative side, but I heard about a new class and took it to see what it was like."She became enamoured with a virtual approach to building computing programs that bypasses traditional coding techniques that alienate many of those who aren't technologically adept.Fuelled by artificial intelligence this VR method is often referred to as no-code coding.More students in the US and overseas are likely to see these VR techniques in the coming months.Exponential Destiny has projects running in four schools at the moment, with plans to introduce the system to another two in the US and four schools outside the US.Back at Nava College a former pupil, Juan Felix, has returned to take a class of 18 students with limited English through the technology maze.His students discover routes into college or a career in a VR world where they can pull together the elements of covering letters and job application forms."It is crazy. They're not speaking English as a first language and they've not been exposed to the technology before, but despite these barriers they learn very quickly," he says.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Yogita Limaye "><Text>On the morning of 30 September, 20-year-old Mariam was scrambling to get to the Kaaj education centre, in Kabul's Dasht-e-Barchi area, which is largely home to the city's ethnic Hazara minority. Wahidah, her closest friend, had called her early that morning and said "Why are you still asleep? Wake up, we have the exam today." It was a practice test in preparation for Concor, a university entrance exam in Afghanistan.While Mariam was on her way to the centre, Wahidah had called again to ask her to hurry, saying she'd kept a seat for her. At 7:15am, Mariam had just arrived at the centre when she heard a string of gunfire. "Then there was the most terrible explosion I've ever heard," she recalls. "I saw boys running out of the centre, jumping over its boundary wall. A few seconds later, I saw girls running out too. Many of them were injured, blood on their faces and clothes."Mariam was not allowed into the centre but she refused to go home. She kept waiting for Wahidah to come outside. She never did. Wahidah was among the 45 female students who were killed in the suicide attack at the private coaching institute on 30 September. "She was like my sister. We shared all our secrets," Mariam says. "Wahidah didn't miss a single day of the preparatory course. Whether it rained or snowed or there was a flood, even though she lived farthest away from centre, she was always there."On that Friday morning, Wahidah's father Mohammad Amir Hyderi had left to go to his shop early. "I didn't even see her that day," he says. "She was the hero of our family, my angel. She always excelled at school. And even in a practice exam last month, she was the top scorer among 650 students. But it wasn't just that she was clever. She was so well-behaved and devout that everyone in our community loved her. I don't know why God chose me to be her father, but then why did he take her away so soon?"For hours after the explosion, Mohammad and Mariam went to several hospitals looking for Wahidah. "The Taliban were not letting us in. Finally at the Ali Jinnah hospital, Mariam slipped inside," Mohammad says, weeping as he recalled that day. "She came out crying and screaming a few minutes later, saying she'd seen Wahidah's body."  As Afghanistan's economy crumbles, it's difficult for Mohammad to pay for private lessons, especially through his meagre earnings selling vegetables. "I would save wherever I could. I'd buy less food and go without some things to pay for Wahidah and my other children's education," he said.Since the Taliban seized power last August, girls have been barred from going to secondary school in most of Afghanistan, including Kabul. Wahidah had finished secondary school last year, but was worried about her younger sisters' education. "She had started teaching her sisters all the subjects taught at school," Mohammad says.With restrictions on the rights and freedoms of women increasing under the Taliban, it has been a time of despair for millions of young women and girls in the country. "Whenever I used to feel hopeless or couldn't find the motivation to study, I would end up missing classes. Wahidah would say to me, 'I'll help you, don't worry, but please come for class,'" Mariam says.  For many girls who would have been in secondary school, the private education centre was a way out of the emptiness that filled their days. Omulbanin Asghari, 17, dreamed of going to Harvard University to study political science or economics. Barred from school in her final year, she studied as much as she could at home, and also took courses at Kaaj. "She wanted to make sure that she didn't miss out, and that her knowledge was at the level of a final year student," her brother Mukhtar Modabber said. "She used to read a lot. She was always surrounded by books. And she'd also exercise every day to keep fit."Mukhtar was also Omulbanin's teacher. He has been teaching physics and mathematics at Kaaj centre for 10 years. "Omul would always smile and joke with me and say 'Lala (brother), I'm going to go abroad and study, and then come back and work for the rights of women. You'll see - one day I'll be more famous than you,'" he says.  On 23 March, the Taliban had announced that secondary schools would reopen for girls. Omulbanin went to school, but she and her classmates were sent back in just an hour. The Taliban had rolled back their decision. "It's the worst memory I have of her. I was the first person she called. She couldn't stop crying," Mukhtar said. "Since then she would get upset every morning when school would normally have started, and in the afternoon when it would have ended."On the morning of the attack, Omulbanin was in a cheerful mood. "She was very happy. She had breakfast early, and left for the centre earlier than usual," Mukhtar said. He was at home when he received a call from his younger brother, who also works at the centre. Mukhtar was told their sister had been injured. He ran to the centre where he found out that she had been killed.The youngest of five siblings, Omulbanin, Mukhtar says, was the most loved child of the family. "We are devastated. My mother has a heart ailment, and she's in a very bad condition since Omul died."Afghanistan has seen numerous attacks on schools and places of education, in particular those dominated by the Hazara community. No group has so far claimed responsibility for last Friday's bombing, but the Islamic State Khorasan Province or ISKP - the regional affiliate of Islamic State - has claimed that it was behind earlier attacks. "Each attack affects the morale of all students, but especially girls. It scares them, and us," Mukhtar said. "But despite the danger, I will continue teaching. The people behind this violence are scared that their future will be at risk if Afghanistan's younger generation is educated. This week, I've lost my sister and so many of my other students. But I have to remember that hundreds are still alive and want an education. I don't want their future to be dark."Wahidah's father would often tell her to stop going attending classes at the centre because it was too dangerous. "She wouldn't say anything to me but she'd tell her mother that she wouldn't stop because she wanted to study medicine and serve her country," Mohammad said. 'I am just waiting for the centre to reopen and I will go back to my course. I used to need motivation to attend classes, but now it's a commitment and responsibility for me," Mariam says. "I have to continue my education, for Wahidah, for Nazanin, Shabnam, Nargis, for Samira, for tens of my friends who were killed. One day, we will win."She isn't sure when that day will come or if it will happen in her lifetime but she is certain it will happen eventually: "Maybe more of us will be killed, but we will definitely win." </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Sam Cabral &amp; Amund Trellevik "><Text>America's leaders are old and growing older. As part of a new series that looks abroad for inspiration on how to fix flaws in the US political system, we ask whether Norway's young MPs have the answer.Democratic President Joe Biden, 79, is the country's oldest ever leader. His chief rival, Republican Donald Trump, is 76.In the US Congress, the median age is the highest in two decades. Baby boomers dominate and millennials represent barely 6% of the body.Midterm elections this November will reshuffle the makeup of the legislative branch of government - but many of its oldest faces will remain.The problem is a structural one, according to experts.Congress prizes seniority, with the longest-tenured lawmakers typically first in line for leadership posts, plum committee assignments and other forms of influence. Name recognition and visibility gives incumbents a smoother path to re-election.Making matters worse are the age requirements. You must be at least 25 to join the House of Representatives, the lower chamber of Congress, and at least 30 to qualify for the Senate.Meanwhile, young hopefuls face financial barriers to seeking office with fewer resources, less access to wealth and obstacles like childcare costs or student debt.What's it like being elected in your 20s?How Pelosi rose to the top - and stayed thereSome believe youth under-representation has had a profound impact on US democracy. "Lived experience informs legislative priorities," says Amanda Litman, co-founder of Run for Something, a group that supports progressive candidates under 40. She claims that a lack of progress on issues young people care about, such as gun violence and climate change, have fed "a cycle of cynicism" and disengagement.Norway has the highest proportion of young politicians in the world, according to data published by the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), with 13.6% under 30. In the US, it's 0.23% in the House of Representatives and zero in the Senate.It's a similar story with average age - only the UK's House of Lords and Canada's upper chamber are "older" than the US Senate. Norway's average age is 18 years younger.Maren Grøthe became the youngest national politician in Norway's history when she was elected to its national assembly, the Storting, aged just 20 last year.Born just a few months before the terrorist attacks on 9/11 in 2001, she is one of 23 representatives under the age of 30, up by six since 2013."I really enjoy it. This is a job with great responsibilities, and I feel those responsibilities every day," Grøthe tells the BBC.The average age in the Storting is 46 and has remained so since the end of the 1990s, because while a record number of young people are joining, they are also working longer. The oldest is 77.Jonny Lang of the IPU which collects the global data says it's crucial that parliaments look more like the countries they represent. And having young people's perspectives leads to better policies. Despite her young age, Grøthe had already served two years as a local politician in her home municipality when she was elected to the national assembly.She has a wide range of tasks.  A recent week began with a parliamentary committee trip to Germany and ended with her back home to attend the opening of a new football pitch outside Trondheim in central Norway where she lives with her boyfriend.The workdays are long, and the business trips are many. Every week she commutes to her apartment in the capital Oslo.She describes herself as an "ordinary Norwegian youth" who likes both partying with friends and hiking in the mountains. But since she was elected to the Storting, there has been far less time for such activities.Grøthe believes that having so many young politicians in the Storting brings many advantages, with  different cultures and ages better represented. "We young people have life experience, but in a different way. We need to develop policies for everyone in the country."But what can she contribute to politics that a 55-year-old can't?"I have completely different perspectives and knowledge on being young today. More and more young people struggle with their mental health. I have also just finished my high school education, which is useful in the education committee in the national assembly," she says.The electoral system is one reason Norway has the world's youngest parliament, believes Ragnhild Louise Muriaas, professor of political science at the University of Bergen. Several people from the same party can be elected in the same district. "This means that an older and well-known man may be the top candidate, but unknown, young women may be nominated for the next positions on the list and be sure to be elected," she says. In France, UK and the US it's winner takes all and parties feel they cannot "afford" to top the lists with young, inexperienced candidates.The youth wings of the political parties also play a part, she adds. These organisations are a strong political force, often with opinions opposing those of the parent party.There are possible drawbacks too, says Muriaas. She is looking into whether young politicians disappear more quickly from politics. The lack of life and work experiences before being elected is another open question.The Norway model has not been replicated in the US, but researchers at Tufts University's Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE) suggest some developments in recent years may boost youth representation.They argue that while political parties do not typically have a youth strategy, youth organisations - particularly on the Republican side - have garnered more visibility and funding. They also point out the growing adoption of electoral measures such as ranked-choice voting, where voters rank candidates based on preference, can benefit young candidates.But because party gatekeepers often suppress young candidates, the young and civically-engaged need to be actively encouraged or financially supported to run for office, beginning at the local level, says CIRCLE fellow Sara Suzuki.Two members of Generation Z - a Democrat and Republican apiece - will appear on midterm ballots this November for the first time. If they win, they will chip away at older generations' dominance in Congress.As Americans prepare to vote we will be visiting countries around the world looking for answers to challenges facing the US political systemWe will be tackling subjects like fake news, gridlock in Congress, lack of female representation and low turnoutReporters in Bolivia, Finland, Australia and Switzerland will explain how these issues are handled where they live</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By James Waterhouse in Zaporizhzhia and Yaroslav Lukov in London"><Text>At least 23 people have been killed and dozens more injured in a Russian rocket strike on a civilian convoy in south Ukraine, local officials say.A huge crater next to a row of vehicles in the city of Zaporizhzhia testifies to the violence of the attack. Windows and windscreens were smashed in.The BBC saw half a dozen bodies lying at the scene, apparently civilians. Baggage and coats strewed the tarmac. One survivor told the BBC her boss had been killed in the attack."She had two kids. I left the cafe to use the restroom when it happened. I ran back and tried to find her. The cafe was demolished, there were many bodies around. It was all so very horrifying," Viktoriia Yosypenko said.Reacting to the attack in the early hours of Friday on the outskirts of the regional capital of the Zaporizhzhia region, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia was a "state-terrorist".He said Russia launched 16 rockets on the city, and vowed to punish perpetrators for "every lost Ukrainian life".Meanwhile, a Russian-installed local official blamed Ukraine for the attack.The convoy was hit as people were preparing to travel to the Russian-occupied part of the region to pick up their relatives and also deliver humanitarian aid.Tears and despair as Russian annexation loomsNear the missile's impact crater, the BBC spoke to Kateryna Holoborod, sat on her suitcase in a state of shock. 'We arrived in a line, to join a column going towards Kherson," she said. "We got out to see what number we had in the queue. Then the first rocket hit, behind the wagons. "We dropped to the ground. Then the second one hit in the centre of the queue. There was glass everywhere, people screaming and running. I don't remember much. "It was very scary. I then got up to see what happened, help the injured. I tried to help an injured young man when the third explosion happened."The attack comes as Russian President Vladimir Putin is preparing for a signing ceremony in Moscow to annex Zaporizhzhia along with Ukraine's Donetsk, Luhansk and Kherson regions.The move follows self-styled referendums in the eastern and southern regions, which have been condemned by Ukraine and the West as a sham.Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February, and Moscow currently controls the majority of the Zaporizhzhia region, including Europe's biggest nuclear power plant there - but not the regional capital.Moscow-installed regional official Vladimir Rogov blamed "Ukrainian militants" for the Zaporizhzhia attack, Russian state-run media reported.In a separate development, one person was killed and five injured in overnight Russian strikes by Iskander missiles on the central city of Dnipro, about 70km (43 miles) north of Zaporizhzhia, local officials said.They said a transport company was targeted, and as many as 52 buses were burnt and another 98 damaged.Several high-rise buildings, offices and a shop were also hit.You may also be interested in: </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Raffi Berg"><Text>About 20 members of a Jewish sect held at a facility in Mexico after a police raid on their jungle base have fled.Footage showed men, women, and children streaming out of the site in Huixtla, in the west, on Wednesday night.They had been there since the raid last Friday when two members were arrested on suspicion of human trafficking and serious sexual offences.The sect, Lev Tahor, is known for extremist practices and imposing a strict regime on its followers.It advocates child marriage, inflicts harsh punishments even for minor transgressions and requires women and girls as young as three years old to completely cover up with robes.Local media said members of the group had been protesting against their detention since their arrival, including rioting and assaulting personnel.Video from Reuters news agency shows the detainees, dressed in gold, grey and white robes, forcing their way past two guards at a gate as one of their members holds it open.One of the guards trying to hold them back falls down and the group climb over him as they make their escape. A youth is seen turning and kicking the guard as he lies on the ground.  It is unclear where the group has gone. Associated Press said they were collected by a lorry and headed towards the border with Guatemala, while news site El Heraldo de México said they went by foot for several miles before disappearing into the night.Their compound, 11 miles (17.5km) north of Tapachula in Chiapas state, was raided by an elite police unit after a months-long investigation and surveillance operation involving Mexican and Guatemalan authorities and a private four-man team from Israel including former Mossad and domestic intelligence agents.Twenty-six members were found at the site, among them Israelis with dual citizenships including Canada, the US and Guatemala, Israel's foreign ministry said.It said a Canadian and an Israeli citizen were arrested, while two other wanted members reportedly left the compound two days before the raid and are being sought. Five more were detained for allegedly breaking immigration rules.The operation stemmed from an appeal to a former member of Israel's domestic intelligence agency, Shin Bet, by a former member of the sect, Yisrael Amir.Mr Amir fled the group's base in Guatemala in 2020, having to leave his then one-year-old son there.His son was released in the raid last week and flown back to Israel with his father.The group had lived in Guatemala since 2014, but in January members illegally crossed into Mexico, settling in the jungle. The leadership in Guatemala has been at the centre of a kidnapping case since 2018. Nine of the sect's members have been charged, four of whom have so far been convicted. Lev Tahor - Hebrew for Pure of Heart - was formed in Israel in 1988 and is thought to number up to 350 members, according to an ex-members group.It has been forced to move from country to country in recent years after coming under scrutiny from local authorities. It is currently spread between Israel, the US, North Macedonia, Morocco, Mexico and Guatemala. Between 70 and 80 members are still in Guatemala.While the group is often described as ultra-Orthodox, it follows its own sets of rules and has been declared a "dangerous cult" by an Israeli court.Its leaders have denied breaking local laws and say the group is being targeted because of its beliefs.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="BBC News, author unspecified"><Text>The European Union has agreed to impose emergency measures to charge energy firms on their record profits.Ministers have agreed windfall taxes on certain energy companies as well as mandatory cuts in electricity use.The plan includes a levy on fossil fuel firms' surplus profits and a levy on excess revenues made from surging electricity costs. The cash raised is expected to go to families and businesses.But the bloc is divided on whether and how to cap the wholesale price of gas.It comes as Europe braces itself for a difficult winter due to the cost of living crisis and squeeze on global energy supplies.What is the windfall tax on oil and gas companies?Germany vows €65bn package to combat energy crisisThe bloc is largely trying to wean itself off Russia energy but it has left it scrambling for other alternative, expensive, sources.A windfall tax is imposed by a government on a company to target firms that were lucky enough to benefit from something they were not responsible for - in other words, a windfall profit. Energy firms are getting much more money for their oil and gas than they were last year, partly because demand has increased as the world emerges from the pandemic and more recently because of supply concerns due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.EU ministers estimate that they can raise €140bn (£123bn) from the levies on non-gas electricity producers and suppliers that are making larger-than-usual profits from the current demand.Earlier this month, the European Commission's vice-president, Frans Timmermans, said that fossil fuel extractors will be told to give back 33% of their surplus profits for this year. "The era of cheap fossil fuels is over. And the faster we move to cheap, clean and homegrown renewables, the sooner we will be immune to Russia's energy blackmail," he said."A cap on outsize revenues will bring solidarity from energy companies with abnormally high profits towards their struggling customers," he added. Earlier this week, 15 member states, including France and Italy, asked the EU to impose a price cap on gas bills to slow the soaring costs. A decision has not yet been announced on a price cap. "There is big disappointment that in the proposal that is on the table there is nothing about gas prices," Polish climate minister Anna Moskwa said.Ms Moskwa said a maximum price for gas would be supported by the majority of European countries and "cannot be ignored". In the UK, former Chancellor Rishi Sunak introduced a similar tax to Friday's EU agreement in May, which he called the Energy Profits Levy.It was applied to profits made by companies from extracting UK oil and gas, but not those that generate electricity from sources such as nuclear or wind power. </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="BBC News, author unspecified"><Text>A suicide attack at a tuition centre in the Afghan capital Kabul has killed at least 19 people, most of them female students, police and witnesses say.Nearly 30 others were wounded at the Kaaj education centre in the Dasht-e-Barchi area in the west of the city.Students had been sitting a practice university exam when the bomber struck. No group has yet claimed the attack.Many of those in the area are minority Hazaras, who have often been targeted by Islamic State (IS) militants.Footage on local TV and shared on social media appeared to show scenes from a nearby hospital, where rows of covered bodies were laid out on the floor. Other media reportedly from the site of the private college showed rubble and upturned tables in the damaged classrooms."We didn't find her here," a woman who was looking for her sister at one of the hospitals told AFP news agency. "She was 19 years old." Some reports say the number of dead is far higher than Taliban officials have acknowledged. The attacker is reported to have shot at the guards outside the centre, entered a classroom and detonated a bomb.Eyewitnesses told the BBC that most of the victims were girls - they were seated in the front row, near the blast. A student who was wounded told AFP that there were around 600 people in the room when the attack happened. The Kaaj tuition centre is a private college which teaches both male and female students. Most girls' schools in the country have been closed since the Taliban returned to power in August last year, but some private schools are open.Hazaras, most of whom are Shia Muslims, are Afghanistan's third largest ethnic group. They have long faced persecution from the regional affiliate of Islamic State (ISKP) and the Taliban, which both adhere to Sunni Islam. The pupils too afraid to return to schoolSunnis and Shia: Islam's ancient schismThe secret girls school defying the TalibanOn Friday the Taliban's interior ministry spokesman said security teams were at the site and condemned the attack.Abdul Nafy Takor said attacking civilian targets "proves the enemy's inhuman cruelty and lack of moral standards". The attack was also strongly condemned by the United Nations and the US. "Targeting a room full of students taking exams is shameful; all students should be able to pursue an education in peace and without fear," said Karen Decker, charge d'affaires at the US mission to Afghanistan, in a tweet. The security situation in Afghanistan, which had improved after the end of fighting following the Taliban takeover, has been deteriorating in recent months, with a number of attacks on civilians but also Taliban supporters. Some have been claimed by IS, which is a bitter rival of the Taliban.Schools and hospitals have been targeted in the Dasht-e-Barchi area in a series of attacks, most of which are thought to have been the work of IS.Last year - before the Taliban returned to power - a bomb attack on a girls school in Dasht-e-Barchi killed at least 85 people, mainly students, and wounded hundreds more.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Flora Drury"><Text>A rights group has called on Fifa to ban Iran from this year's World Cup after blocking women from watching games in their own country.Open Stadiums questioned why the country was being allowed to compete while "Iranian women remain locked out of our 'Beautiful Game'" by officials.The call comes weeks after women were allowed to attend a domestic match for the first time since 1979.However, the rights group was sceptical stadiums would remain open to women."Iranian women trust neither the Islamic Republic's authorities nor the Iranian Football Federation that the Azadi stadium will remain open to them after the Fifa World Cup 2022 concludes on December 18," Open Stadiums said in an open letter to Fifa's president, Gianni Infantino.It also argues that even those who travel to Qatar to watch matches risk falling foul of Iranian authorities, with fears state spies may keep tabs on those who attend.Prohibiting women from games goes against international football rules, the letter points out, arguing Fifa should "immediately expel Iran from the World Cup 2022 in Qatar" as a result.What happens when sport and politics collide in IranIranian news sites reported speculation that women were allowed to attend the match in August after Fifa sent a letter to authorities calling on them to permit more women into stadiums. Fifa has previously told the BBC it would not "turn its eyes" away from the issue.There is no official ban on women going to sporting events in Iran, but it is rare as they are often refused entry.Prior to this, women had effectively been barred from domestic matches where men are playing due to clerical disapproval under the Shia Muslim regime. Women have attended a handful of international matches, including one in March this year, news agency Reuters reports.The rights group, which campaigns for equal access to sport in Iran, also claimed in the letter that members of the football team going to Qatar later this year had been banned from speaking out over deadly protests currently rocking the country. They were sparked by the death in custody of a young woman, Mahsa Amini, after she was detained morality police.The letter points out that the detention centre where she died is the same one "where female fans are usually brought to and tortured if we dare to try to attend a football game".Neither the Iranian football association or Fifa have responded to a request for comment from Reuters.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Christy Cooney"><Text>Comedian Trevor Noah has announced he is standing down as host of The Daily Show. Noah said he was "filled with gratitude for the journey" but that there was "another part of my life that I want to carry on exploring".The 38-year-old has hosted the satirical news and talk show since taking over from Jon Stewart in 2015. He said the timing of his departure would be announced later and that he would continue as host in the meantime. Noah began his career in his native South Africa, releasing a string of stand-up specials and hosting a late-night talk show before relocating to the US in 2011. He was still a relative unknown when he was chosen to take over the Daily Show on the Comedy Central network, but has since become an internationally-recognised star and won numerous television awards. Noah made the announcement at the end of his show on Thursday night, prompting shocked gasps from the studio audience.He thanked the show's crew and loyal fans for an "amazing seven years", adding: "It's been wild, truly wild". "I remember when we first started... so many people didn't believed in us," he said. "[Appointing me as host] was a crazy bet to make. I still think it was a crazy choice, this random African. "I just [find] myself filled with gratitude for the journey. It's been absolutely amazing. It's something that I never expected."The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterHe said that after everything that has happened during his time hosting the show - including Donald Trump's presidency and the Covid pandemic - he had decided his "time is up, but in the most beautiful way".

"I realised there's another part of my life that I want to carry on exploring. I miss learning other languages, I miss going to other countries and putting on shows. I miss just being everywhere and doing everything."I'm really grateful to a network who believed in this random comedian nobody knew on this side of the world."I never dreamed that I would be here.

They've made the hazardous trip out of Russian-occupied territory in southern Ukraine, finally reaching the relative safety of this regional capital still firmly under Ukrainian control.And yet this is one of four Ukrainian regions that Russia is formally annexing, after a five-day exercise it called a referendum and Ukraine and the West condemned as a sham.Among those handing their papers to police is Anton Osenev, who says the Russians tried to mobilise him twice to fight against his own country, around his home city of Melitopol. "We weren't home for the first attempt," he says. "On the second occasion they stayed at our house for some time". Had it not been for his pregnant wife being in the room, they would have taken him, he believes. His father is in the Ukrainian army, and if he had been seized he would have been on the opposite side."I still don't understand what's happening, we need some rest."Few here care about Moscow's declaration of annexation.  What they are afraid of is what the occupiers will do now to defend what they've taken - whether that is being forced to fight for Russia, or Moscow resorting to more lethal weapons.Last week Vladimir Putin threatened to use all resources at his disposal, even nuclear weapons.For the Kremlin, that's the very point - to create uncertainty over what comes next.As you drive south towards the front line from Zaporizhzhia city, the roads seem to empty.Fewer people walk along the roadside. A car or military vehicle occasionally speeds by. You don't go for leisurely drives around here.What you do get more of are military checkpoints. Ukrainian forces use them to control who gets through, and work out who is coming from the direction of Russian-occupied territory. After our military escort gets us through, we're met with an open, straight road.Half an hour later we arrive at the village of Komyshuvakha, a small settlement in the Ukrainian outback.A handful of damaged buildings hug a wide, straight highway. Most windows are boarded up. On this autumnal afternoon it's almost silent. If we carried on driving for 11 miles, we'd encounter a Russian checkpoint. An area Moscow now sees as its new "border" with Ukraine. Despite the region's capital staying under Ukrainian control, Russian forces control most of the Zaporizhzhia region. Today's annexation announcement is a continuation of their attempts to make their presence seem just. For those we meet in Komyshuvakha, nothing seems fair.One of them is Liubov Smyrnova. She tearfully takes us to a burnt-out shell which was once her home. It was hit by a missile in May. She's only just felt able to return. "I think that Putin's politics is to destroy us, it's a genocide of our people," she tells me, while sifting through fragments of shrapnel. "We are under constant pressure. I can't even describe it with words. Komyshuvakha is shelled almost every day."Most people are inside because strikes tend to happen in the middle of the day, we're told. For now, the sound of birdsong and the occasional bark of a dog masks what has happened to this small community. It dawns on you that it's mostly women left here. The men of Komyshuvakha are mostly fighting, or just elsewhere.Around the corner, we speak to three women outside the building they've lived in for 70 years. Their eyes moisten as the strain of life here bubbles to the surface. "Winter is coming and there's not a single window in the house," they explain, often talking over each other. "It's like we're sitting on a powder keg." So, what do they make of Russia's claim to half of the region they live in?"There should be a free and independent Ukraine," they say. "We didn't attack anyone, didn't hurt anyone, and didn't want anything. We want to live the way we did before."Behind a fire escape door in an empty kindergarten, there's activity. Through it are three women busily washing potatoes and cooking pancakes. They don't know who they're cooking for, they say, just that the Ukrainian military instructs them to. As she stirs batter in a large bowl, I ask Anzhela whether she cares that Russia now sees her village as being close to its new "border"."We don't want that," she says. "We want to live the way we lived. Everything was fine, everything was all right." She whisks with a bit more vigour. "We grew up this way. Our children grew up this way and our grandchildren too." </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Tiffanie Turnbull"><Text>Australia has said it will end mandatory Covid isolation requirements from next month.Currently anyone who tests positive to the virus must isolate for five days, but that will end from 14 October.At times nicknamed "Fortress Australia", the country has had some of the strictest restrictions in the world since the pandemic began. Australia's chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, said the "emergency phase" of its response was probably over. But Prof Kelly said the decision "does not in any way suggest that the pandemic is finished".Mandatory isolation had been one of the few restrictions remaining. Australia continues to record about 5,500 virus cases each day, official figures show. It is one of the world's most vaccinated countries.Prof Kelly said the country would see "future peaks" of the virus, but it currently had "very low" numbers of hospital admissions and aged-care outbreaks.The Australian Medical Association opposes the change, saying those who pushed for it are not "scientifically literate" and are putting lives at risk.About 15,000 people have died with the virus in Australia - fewer than many nations. The vast majority have happened this year after the country opened up. Australia had closed international borders for around two years and imposed strict limits on movement around the country.Australia revisited - a country changed by CovidIs Australia still a Covid success story? Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said most existing governments payments for people who have to miss work because of Covid would also be scrapped."It was always envisaged that these measures were emergency measures," he said.Casual workers and those in high-risk areas like aged care or health will still be able to get financial support.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Frances Mao"><Text>Women working at Australia's research camps in Antarctica have endured widespread sexual harassment, a report has found.It described evidence of uninvited touching, requests for sex, and a predatory culture which condoned pornography on walls and sexual taunts.Woman also felt they had to hide their menstruation, and ration tampons and pads because they were so limited.Officials have condemned the findings and vowed to bring on cultural change.Australia's Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek said she was "gobsmacked" by the independent review of Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) sites. It was instigated after individuals made complaints."As a minister, I take a zero-tolerance response to sexual harassment in any workplace I am responsible for," Ms Plibersek told the Australian Broadcasting Corp (ABC).Australia's Antarctic sites are located on the continent's eastern edge, and include the Casey, Davis and Mawson research stations. During the summer up to 500 expeditioners can be dispatched there, but during winter months the camps are reduced to about 15-30 key workers. Those workers - including doctors, chefs, and field officers - typically spend a year living at a station.Women in the camps felt like they couldn't escape or get immediate help due to the remote and isolated environment, said the report's author Meredith Nash, a professor at the Australian National University.They "have to work in the fields with their abusers for weeks at a time because they simply can't leave", she told the ABC, which first reported the findings on Friday."Or, because of the power dynamics, they are not in a position to make a complaint or get support immediately as they would do back home," she added.Sex harassment rife in Australia parliament - reportThe long-lasting effects of workplace sexual harassmentThe report also found a homophobic culture among the male-dominated field, and said people feared speaking out because they didn't want to be excluded from future expeditions.In such a masculine environment, women scientists felt pressure to hide their periods out of fear of male judgement, the review said.Women also had to "go through a gatekeeper to access free menstrual products" with a voucher request system, reflecting a lack of adequate support in basic camp infrastructure. AAD Director Kim Ellis said they were already putting in place the report's recommendations."I am deeply concerned by the experiences described at our workplaces where people have been sexually harassed, discriminated against and excluded," he said.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Malu Cursino"><Text>Morocco's culture ministry has accused Adidas of appropriating Moroccan culture in its new jerseys for Algeria's football team.Adidas said the design was inspired by the Mechouar Palace in Algeria.However the geometric blue, teal and yellow design is a pattern called zellige, which is common in Moroccan mosaics, the ministry's lawyer said.The neighbouring nations have a long history of tensions, as they continue to dispute Western Sahara. Lawyer Mourad Elajouti wrote on Facebook that he had issued a legal warning to Adidas, on behalf of Morocco's Ministry of Culture.In a letter to the company's chief executive Kasper Rorsted, Mr Elajouti said the new design was cultural appropriation and "an attempt to steal a form of Moroccan cultural heritage and use it outside its context".He has demanded the German sportswear brand remove the design within two weeks.Mr Elajouti added that Algeria's 2022-2023 season kit "contributes to the loss and distortion of the identity and history of these [zellige] cultural elements".The BBC has contacted Adidas for comment.Algeria and Morocco share a nearly 2,000 km (1,242 miles) border, which has been a source of tension since independence from French colonial rule.In 1963, they had the Sand War over Morocco's claim to territory in Algeria.

He says "it is not likely that the Russians detonated their own pipeline. They could have simply cut-off gas to the pipeline entrance" if they wanted to stop supplies.The money Russia continues to receive for its fossil fuels is helping fund its invasion of Ukraine. The gas escaping from the pipeline near the Danish island of Bornholm has been in the pipe since the beginning of September when Moscow closed it off, saying repairs were needed to a vital artery in supplying Europe's energy needs. Ms Granholm suggested the energy relationship between Russia and Europe was being consigned to history."I think Russia has proven itself to be an unreliable energy partner," she said."No country wants to take the risk of putting a significant amount of its energy demand to Russia's supply. I think this accelerates the EU's push to become energy independent through clean energy".The war in Ukraine has had a profound impact in pushing up global energy prices. They've been the biggest contributor to soaring inflation in the UK, Eurozone and US, something which is threatening to reduce global economic growth.The increasing cost of living has made political leaders around the world re-evaluate where they get their energy from, according to Ms Granholm, who was speaking from the International Atomic Energy Agency's Ministerial Conference in Vienna."Every country is looking at the risks associated with putting too many eggs in one basket or putting too many eggs in the basket of petro-dictators and the volatility of the fossil fuels that accrue from that. Everyone is looking to how they can become energy independent."Wind, solar and nuclear energy are among the alternatives many countries are trying to increase as they also aim to meet the Paris climate change targets.However an analysis by Columbia University suggests that Russia has a 46% share of global enrichment capacity for nuclear fuel, and the International Energy Agency warned in July that China has an 80% share "in all the key manufacturing stages of solar panels".When asked how the US and others don't end up overly reliant on such alternatives Ms Granholm replied that "this move to clean energy could be part of a great peace plan" and that such a move "helps people's pocketbooks, helps the economy, and helps energy security".This year's steep increases in the price of oil and gas have benefitted the energy giants who get them to consumers. In the first half of this year the combined profit of five of the biggest western energy firms, BP, Shell, Total, Chevron and Exxon almost tripled to just over $95.2bn with much of it going to shareholders.Ms Granholm said President Biden's administration wanted to see such companies lower prices at petrol pumps "so that citizens are not hurting".Despite acknowledging that oil is traded on a free market she called on them to help, "at least the American companies as good American citizens" and warned they could face a windfall tax similar to what has been seen in the UK."We don't want that huge amount of profit to end up triggering consequences, either Congressionally or elsewhere, that will not be in their interest."We want them to be responsible and not be buying back shares instead of increasing production, production that would ultimately reduce prices because of increasing supply. We are looking at legislative tools as well as otherwise pressuring them."One other way the US could help increase the supply of oil to global markets is by lifting some of the sanctions imposed on Venezuela by President Trump.The South American country has the world's largest oil reserves but has been exporting minimal amounts of oil because of the restrictions. They were enacted because of alleged corruption and the political fallout from 2019's contested election. An increase in supplies would be likely to push down global oil prices. When asked if it was time to lift the sanctions, Ms Granholm didn't dismiss the idea, replying: "I'm not going to get ahead of the White House on that."You can watch Jennifer Granholm's interview in full on Talking Business with Aaron Heslehurst this weekend.Viewers in the UK can watch the show at 15:30 on the BBC News Channel, and afterwards on BBC iPlayer.In other countries, it will be on BBC World News on Saturday at 23:30 GMT, Sunday at 05:30 and 16:30 GMT and Monday at 16:30 GMT.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="BBC News, author unspecified"><Text>A US army major doctor and her wife, a civilian doctor, have been charged with a plot to leak information to the Russian government. Jamie Lee Henry and Anna Gabrielian are accused of planning to share confidential information about patients at a military hospital. The pair allegedly told an undercover FBI agent that they were motivated by patriotism for Russia. Representatives of the couple have not yet commented on the case.There has been no comment from Russian authorities, either. The pair were charged with conspiracy and the disclosure of identifiable health information, in an indictment filed in a court in Baltimore, Maryland which was unsealed on Thursday after their arrest. Prosecutors said the couple wanted to help the Russian government "gain insights into the medical conditions of individuals associated with the US government and military".The indictment states that Maj Henry, 39, planned to use her security clearance to gain access to private medical records from the hospital at Fort Bragg, the large military base where she worked. Dr Gabrielian, 36, is accused of planning to share information from where she worked, believed to be Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. She allegedly offered help to the Russian embassy in Washington several months ago, after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In mid-August she was approached by a person claiming to work for the Russian embassy, who was in reality an FBI agent. During the meeting, the indictment says she told the agent that "she was motivated by patriotism toward Russia to provide any assistance she could to Russia, even if it meant being fired or going to jail".She is accused of offering to bring her wife into the plot, and telling the agent that she had access to medical information at the base and insight on how the US was training the military to provide assistance to Ukraine. At another meeting later on the same day, Maj Henry allegedly told the agent that she was also committed to Russia, and considered volunteering to join the Russian army. She apparently said she had reservations about violating the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which is what the couple have been charged with. But Dr Gabrielian allegedly had no such concerns, and handed over some information later in August. The indictment suggests the couple planned to hand over the medical records in order to prove their willingness to help the Russians, and their level of access to secret information. Dr Gabrielian is also accused of telling the agent that her wife could share information about how the US military establishes army hospitals in war conditions, and previous training given by the US to the Ukrainian military. If convicted, the defendants face a maximum of five years in prison for the conspiracy, and 10 years for each count of disclosing health information. Maj Henry was the first known active-duty US Army officer to come out as transgender, after the army granted her permission to officially change her name and gender in 2015, the same year the couple were married.

The incubation period can last from two days to three weeks. Ebola can be associated with other illnesses such as malaria and typhoid.The fact that it was three weeks before the first case was detected on 20 September has caused concern.Ebola spreads between humans by direct contact with bodily fluids and contaminated environments. Funerals can be a particular risk if mourners have direct contact with the body.Most of the 31 cases identified are in Uganda's central district of Mubende, of whom six people have died.However, the death toll may be higher. The health ministry says there were 18 deaths, linked to confirmed cases, where burials took place before they could be tested.The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates the fatality rate is between 41% and 100%.Another concern is that this is the Sudan strain of Ebola, for which there is no approved vaccine, unlike the more common Zaire strain. This means there has been no vaccination of health workers, who account for six of the confirmed cases.The Zaire strain was responsible for the largest ever outbreak of Ebola, in West Africa from December 2013 to 2016. More than 11,000 people died.With more than 28,000 cases in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, scientists carried out intensive research into Ebola vaccines.Two years after that epidemic ended, the then unlicensed Ervebo vaccine, developed by Merck, was used during an outbreak of the Zaire strain in the west of the Democratic Republic of Congo. It was granted clearance by the WHO, which said it had limited infections and saved lives.A second vaccine by Johnson &amp; Johnson has since been approved for use by the European Medicines Agency. But neither of these vaccines has been tested against the Sudan strain.Nonetheless Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni said his government was exploring whether it was worth trying them.The focus is on contact tracing - finding those who have been in close proximity with patients, especially those who attended the community funerals.A 51-bed treatment facility is operational in Mubende district, the epicentre of the outbreak. A second facility is due to be set up soon.President Museveni said two mobile laboratories would be sent to Mubende by Friday, so that people would not have to travel for tests and risk spreading the virus.Medics have expressed concern about the lack of adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves and masks. They have also called for the affected region to be put under quarantine. However, President Museveni ruled out restrictions, saying: "Ebola is not spread like corona[virus]" as it is not an airborne disease.He said markets, schools and places of worship would remain open, but urged people to observe personal hygiene and avoid close contact. Ebola jumps to humans from infected animals, such as chimpanzees, fruit bats and forest antelope. Bushmeat - wild forest animals hunted for human consumption - is thought to be the natural reservoir of the virus.It then spreads between humans by direct contact with contaminated bodily fluids - blood, saliva, vomit, semen, vaginal discharge, urine, faeces and sweat.Men who have recovered from Ebola have also been found to harbour the virus in their semen for a period after recovery. To prevent infection, health professionals advise avoiding contact with cases, including stopping shaking hands, washing hands with soap and water and cleaning surfaces with chlorinated water.It is also important to isolate cases and their contacts. Countries usually set up holding centres for suspected cases and treatment centres for laboratory-confirmed cases.In eastern DR Congo, which borders Uganda, survivors of Ebola played a key role in providing care for infected patients as it has been established that they cannot be re-infected. However, medical teams must wear full PPE when attending to cases to prevent infection. Bodies, in a body bag, must be buried by those wearing proper PPE. More recent innovations have included having body bags with clear covers around the face to enable families to view the body safely before burial. </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Jessica Murphy"><Text> In recent years Canada has worked to advance reconciliation with indigenous people in the country. What does the accession of a new King of Canada mean for that process? Earlier this year, at a reception in Canada's national capital, King Charles - at the time the Prince of Wales - was asked for an apology. The request came from Assembly of First Nations National Chief RoseAnne Archibald, who told him that the Crown needs to make amends for the "assimilation and genocide" of indigenous schoolchildren at residential schools run by the Anglican Church - of which Charles is now the head - and for its role in colonisation. The three-day visit was Charles's nineteenth official tour in the country, and his last as the Prince of Wales.Charles did not apologise on the trip, though he spoke of the need to "come to terms with the darker and more difficult aspects" of history.But some are hopeful that the new King's accession will be the beginning of a more positive relationship between the Crown and indigenous peoples in Canada.Around the world, Commonwealth nations, including Canada, are grappling with what the role of the monarchy following Queen Elizabeth's death, and what her son, Charles, should do to make amends for colonialism.  In Canada, the King's accession comes amid a national conversation about reconciliation with indigenous peoples. It is a conversation that has been building for years, but came to the forefront last summer as First Nations came forward with evidence of the discovery of unmarked graves on the sites of former residential schools - government-funded institutions established in the 1800s that were part of a former policy to assimilate indigenous children.For Canada, reconciliation is multi-faceted. In addition to a royal apology, many have called on the Crown to return indigenous artefacts that were removed and taken to Britain, and to play a more active role in honouring historic treaty relationships between the monarchy and indigenous people.These treaties are constitutionally recognised agreements that define the rights and responsibilities between indigenous groups and federal and provincial governments. Treaties with the Crown date back to the 1700s, and negotiating modern treaties is seen as an important part of reconciliation. Cree writer and former treaty negotiator Darrel J McLeod argued in Canada's Globe and Mail newspaper earlier this month that Queen Elizabeth failed to use the resources available to her to make amends for things done in the Crown's name - from issuing formal apology to the repatriation of indigenous artefacts.He said he hoped the King will "have the insight and determination to accomplish what his mother wasn't able to and use whatever time that might remain for the Windsor dynasty's role in Canada to turn things around". The child graves behind Canada's national reckoningWATCH: Canada 'Sixties Scoop' - Indigenous survivors map out their storiesCanada was a monarchy even before it was a country. Over 500 years ago, both French and British monarchs presided over colonies in Canada. The connection between the Crown and indigenous peoples dates back even further, to when Europeans first set foot on the continent.To this day, symbols of treaties signed in the 1800s with the Crown can be seen on the prairies. When they were signed, 'treaty medals', which acknowledged promises made by the Crown, were handed out. "It had the Queen's image on one side, and that was given to every chief who signed the treaty," noted Doug Cuthand, a Canadian columnist and member of the Little Pine First Nation in the province of Saskatchewan. "And every chief who signs a treaty was given a Union Jack, because Canada didn't have a flag at that time."Although now it is the federal government, and not the Royal Family, that has the power to administer these agreements, the Crown still has a symbolic relationship with indigenous people. Union Jacks are still a common sight at First Nations gatherings across those provinces, signifying the importance of those agreements, said Mr Cuthand. Canada's Governor General Mary Simon is the representative of the Crown in Canada, one of 15 countries where the King continues to operate as head of state. An Inuk woman - and the first indigenous person in the role - she recalled how as a child in the far north, portraits of the Queen hung in many homes."She was revered by communities, Inuit people in the Arctic," she told the BBC's Chief International Correspondent Lyse Doucet earlier this month.But there is anger directed at the monarchy as well. In Manitoba last year, statues of Queen Victoria and Queen Elizabeth were toppled during protests over the unmarked graves at residential school sites. There is a recognition by indigenous people of the damage that colonialism did to the First Nations, said Mr Cuthand, but also of the ties forged long ago."It's a bit of a dichotomy, isn't it?" he said. "There's that sort of high-level relationship that exists, but then there was the implementation of the treaties and of the colonialism that followed."Nathan Tidridge, vice-president of the Institute for the Study of the Crown in Canada, argues that when Canada became a country in 1867, it in many ways eclipsed that original relationship between monarchy and indigenous nations, placing political power and the treaties under the control of federal governments. Entrusted by the Crown to govern, they oversaw damaging policies like residential schooling.Still, many indigenous people in Canada say King Charles has an important role in reconciliation despite being limited to a symbolic role as head of state and expected to not meddle in Canadian political affairs.  "All signs point to an engaged King who is more competent on indigenous issues" than Queen Elizabeth was, said Niigaan Sinclair, professor of indigenous studies at the University of Manitoba. "We need a monarch that's going to intervene when they see injustice taking place," he said - one that's "going to care beyond just nice words.""We need a monarch that's going to have the ear of the prime minister and say 'these are the treaties that you must adhere to because the Crown has signed onto them.'"King Charles recently reiterated to the governor general that he was committed to reconciliation, and Mr Tidridge sees the potential for work to be done through the Crown's representatives like Ms Simon and her counterparts in Canada's provinces. Although he did not apologise on his recent visit, Mr Tidridge thinks that one day the King could come to Canada for the apology requested by Chief Archibald."You don't just come for a whistle-stop tour, and then issue an apology - this takes time," he said."The Crown is this old institution that sweeps up over a millennia of history. He is someone that recognises and understands that history," Mr Tidridge said of the new King."He could do things that I think that his mother couldn't do."</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Juliana Gragnani &amp; Jake Horton"><Text>Before a vote has been cast in Brazil's forthcoming election, current President Jair Bolsonaro is sowing doubts about how secure the country's voting system is. While campaigning, he has said that the voting machines used across Brazil are open to fraud, with echoes of Donald Trump's rhetoric around the 2020 US presidential election."The system is completely vulnerable," claims President Bolsonaro, without providing evidence. Voting is done electronically, as has been the case since 1996.Each candidate has a number, and on election day voters type the number of their chosen candidate into a voting machine at polling stations across the country. The votes are then counted by the machines, and the totals are sent electronically to a central office. Votes from across the country are tallied up and a final result is announced, usually within hours of polls closing. Each machine also prints out a paper copy of the totals for each candidate. When polls close they are displayed publicly at polling sites, and each machine's votes can be compared with the total recorded by the electoral court. This year, for the first time, these paper copies will be published online on the day of the vote.President Bolsonaro has said: "We cannot have dubious elections in 2022. Public counting of votes is needed." He's been making similar claims for years. After winning the 2018 presidential election in a run-off, he claimed voting fraud robbed him of an outright victory in the first round, which he won by a 17 point margin with 46% of the vote.Subsequent studies of the 2018 election didn't find any evidence of voting irregularities. Brazilians vote electronically, so there are no paper copies of individual ballots.This has been highlighted by President Bolsonaro as a security issue, and he has called for "printable and auditable" paper ballots to safeguard the electronic system."It's impossible to audit elections in Brazil," President Bolsonaro declared in July during a meeting with ambassadors.He says it is "easy to rig" electronic voting machines by altering their source code, the internal commands within a machine's software.It's not true to say you can't audit the vote in Brazil. The machines can retrieve votes cast for an electronic recount.Such an audit took place in the 2014 presidential election, which concluded that there was no foul play."There is no reasonable proof of fraud going on in the past, at least in big audits that have been done," says Prof Marcos Simplicio, who took part in the auditing of the 2014 election.The Supreme Electoral Court, the body that oversees Brazil's election, says the system has a series of procedures in place to secure the vote.For example, a number of voting machines are selected at random to be removed from polling sites for a test vote alongside the actual vote on election day.These are checked to be working correctly by entering test votes for each of the candidates in a process witnessed by party representatives. "The vote placed in the electronic ballot box is secured by several mechanisms. The software goes through several tests, including tests with experts and outside investigators who try to break its security," says Julio Valente, the Information Technology Secretary of Brazil's electoral court.Before each election the court invites researchers and software experts to look for vulnerabilities in the voting system. This year, more than 20 experts tried to penetrate the system but failed to do so.However, over the years experts have said improvements could be made."The security of the Brazilian election system relies heavily on the system's software, which has been the main point of criticism from the academic community since the 90s," says Prof Paulo Matias, a computer security specialist at the University of São Carlos. Brazil election: 'We'll vote for Bolsonaro because he is God'Lula: Can Brazil's 'most popular president' win again?Brazil election: Why it matters so much to the USPresident Bolsonaro has also claimed votes are counted in a "secret room" out of public view at the central electoral office. The votes are counted by computers that are located in a secure room but party representatives can monitor the process."The view of most of the technical community is that fraud is really hard in the current system. The system can be improved and should be, but that doesn't mean there's been fraud," says Prof Simplicio.Allegations that the system is unreliable have spread across social media - often in groups backing the president. Just a quarter of Bolsonaro supporters say they trust the electoral system "a lot", and almost a third don't trust it "at all" according to a recent survey.Videos containing misleading information from previous elections are used to cast doubt on the system.  Two videos that were spread following the 2018 election showed voters entering Bolsonaro's number and receiving the message "null vote". However, on the election day, Brazilians don't vote only for the president. They also cast votes for other political representatives, such as senators and governors, and use unique numbers to do so. A closer look at the two videos shows that Bolsonaro's number had been pressed when the voter was asked to choose a  governor. When there is no candidate with that number, a "null vote" message is displayed. Voters can still correct the mistake and press the right number before confirming their vote.Another video allegedly showed a man pressing Bolsonaro's number and the machine showing his rival's picture instead. At the time, the electoral court debunked the video, saying it had been edited. The video didn't show the voting machine buttons and screen at the same time, which meant different images could've been stitched together.Additional reporting by Mariana SanchesRead more from Reality CheckSend us your questions</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Laura Bicker"><Text>Santiago Matela was 22 when he was dragged off the street by soldiers while playing basketball. The year was 1977, five years since President Ferdinand E Marcos had declared martial law in the Philippines -  on 21 September 1972.Mr Marcos suspended parliament and arrested opposition leaders - Mr Matela was among the tens of thousands of people detained and tortured during a decade of martial law.  Fifty years on, he is no longer afraid to speak out. But he is afraid of not being believed at a time when the truth about one of the darkest periods in Filipino history is under attack. Mr Matela endured three months of torture, including being tied naked to a block of ice. His captors demanded he admit to being a communist. He says he didn't even know what that word meant."They kept on forcing me to confess that I was leading a rally and throwing grenades. They asked me the same questions again and again and beat me. They used a yantok - a cane - and they hit my body many times," he said. "Even my genitals were assaulted by the military just to make you confess what you should not be confessing."Some 70,000 people were imprisoned, 34,000 were tortured and over 3,200 people were killed in the nine years after Mr Marcos imposed martial law, according to Amnesty International.Meanwhile, the Marcos family lived famously opulent lifestyles. Mr Marcos' wife, Imelda Marcos, amassed a huge collection of art and other luxuries, including hundreds of pairs of shoes.They deny siphoning off billions of dollars of state wealth while at the helm of what historians consider one of Asia's most notorious kleptocracies. Public anger at abuse and corruption eventually led to pro-democracy protests in 1986 and the family were forced to flee to Hawaii where they lived in exile. Ferdinand Marcos died three years later.But earlier this year, his son and namesake, Ferdinand Marcos Jr - popularly known as "Bongbong" - led an extraordinary comeback and won the presidency in a landslide victory.What a Marcos revival means for the PhilippinesWhy the Marcos family is so infamous'Politicians hire me to spread fake stories'The Marcos rebranding is the result of a major social media operation, aimed at younger Filipinos born after martial law ended. The message seeded in snappy Facebook, YouTube and TikTok posts is that the family has been unfairly treated by the mainstream press.Mr Marcos Jr has shunned network news interviews and refused to participate in presidential debates. He has made it clear he doesn't want to discuss the past and has instead focused on a promise to unite the nation and help it recover from the crippling effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.This popular message, by a recognisable celebrity name, hit home with voters eager for change - including Mr Matela's children. Mr Matela tells me that his son believes the past should stay in the past, a view that he finds upsetting. "My son is adamantly on their side. He doesn't know that what I'm doing is all for them. These are my experiences and what I'm fighting for is for their sake too, so that they will know what happened. "You want me to just disregard what I went through? That cannot happen. The sufferings I went through are embedded in my mind," he said. "I'm still fighting because of my pain."The Marcos administration insists it has not engaged in disinformation. Gemma, a fact checker from the news website Rappler founded by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Maria Ressa, says the disinformation being propagated is difficult to quantify."It's not one single page, it's not one single account, it's not one single group. The point is that it's coming at you from various points. We've mapped tens of thousands of accounts and groups and pages. "Many look like official history pages and post content that triggers nostalgia but within that content you will find stories peddling an incorrect narrative."Among the most widely spread falsehoods are claims that no arrests were made under martial law."Many of the posts deny human rights abuses took place and claim that the only people incarcerated were rebels or criminals or troublemakers," Gemma said. The Marcos administration has not responded to the BBC's requests for an interview. Mr Marcos Jr has posted an interview on YouTube with his goddaughter where he denies that his father was a dictator.The Marcos family has never apologised, but more than 11,000 victims, including Mr Matela, have received reparations from the government.Their written accounts are logged in dozens of numbered cardboard boxes piled high in an archive at the Human Rights Violations Victims' Memorial Commission, an independent government body.In a new green room at the centre, a young team are creating their own snappy social media posts - with facts about martial law."You have to go where the young people are," says executive director Crisanto Carmelo. Fears the past is being rewritten have led to a push to preserve and digitise the detailed accounts of martial law abuse in the hope that they can be placed in a museum. One file recalls how a mother was handed back the body of her brutally tortured and murdered son. The account is too gruesome to detail here.But will Mr Marcos allow such a museum - one built to honour the victims of martial law - while he is president?"I am optimistic that he will be magnanimous in victory and serious in his intention to unify the country," Mr Carmelo said. "This is the year which marks the 50th year of the declaration of martial law which transformed our country and transformed the lives of many ordinary Filipinos. Many of them are now in their senior years, like me, so a museum is not for me, I lived through it. "A museum is for the younger generation - to say that this happened to our country and if we can come together, they can determine what type of country and system of government and rules of liberty and democracy they want for the future."Many young Filipinos are engaged. On a recent popular historical tour, young Filipinos played games to recreate the past.The idea is to help them pin down the facts and navigate away from a maze of martial law myths.The teams took selfies together - most of them had met only a few hours earlier. They planted flowers at the memorial with the names of those who died under martial law.Seventeen-year-old Hannah found the day emotional."They've lost their dreams, their lives and I wanted to recognise that. I want to go and tell my friends that in order for us to have the liberty and democracy we have today, these were people who sacrificed everything. They suffered a lot of violence and immoral wrongdoings, and they deserve to be recognised."It seems that voices from the past, however painful, are helping to keep this country's collective memory alive.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Mark Savage"><Text>When Coolio first heard the demo that became Gangsta's Paradise, he had the same reaction as the rest of us."I was like, 'Damn, I really like this song.'"The Pennsylvania-born, Compton-raised rapper was at his manager's house in 1995 to pick up a cheque, when he noticed producer Doug Rasheed messing around with the song in another room."So I went to Doug said, 'Yo! What's this?'" "He said, 'It's just a song we're working on', "And immediately I said, 'It's mine'. Just like that. "I freestyled the whole first line, then I sat down, I picked up a pen and I started to write." Released in August 1995, and boosted by a memorable video starring Michelle Pfeiffer, the song immediately ruled the airwaves. Those lurching stings, the other-worldly choir, and that soaring hook, combined with Coolio's distinctive, confessional storytelling, made it an instant classic.It was the first "serious" rap song to top the UK and US charts, opening the door for acts like 2Pac and the Notorious B.I.G, who, until that point, had been considered too abrasive for the mainstream. And its appeal has never lessened. The biggest-selling single of 1995 in America, Gangsta's Paradise has now been streamed more than one billion times on both Spotify and YouTube. "I thought it was going to be a hood record," he told The Voice in 2017. "I never thought it would crossover the way that it did - to all ages, races, genres, countries and generations."And yet... Gangsta's Paradise faced several hurdles on its way to the top. Here's how it unfolded...Pfeiffer and Snoop lead tributes to rapper Coolio 'People thought Coolio in Castlederg was a hoax'Coolio was born Artis Leon Ivey, Jr in Pennsylvania, and moved to Compton in South Central LA as a boy. Suffering from chronic asthma, he became a bookworm and excelled at school."I lived in that library, man," he told Rolling Stone, while visiting his old neighbourhood in 1995. "I read every kid's book they had in there. I even read Judy Blume."That changed when he turned 11 and his parents divorced. Seeking a way to fit in, he fell into the gangster lifestyle and adopted a menacing, street-tough persona. A few years later, he was busted for bringing a weapon into school. Before he turned 20, he had served time behind bars for larceny.Later, Coolio studied at Compton Community College and discovered rap. He took his stage name, Coolio Iglesias, from Latin heartthrob from Julio Iglesias, and released a few singles on the local scene, but drug abuse derailed his career.In his 20s he moved to San Jose to live with his father, while working as a firefighter; and later credited Christianity for helping him overcome his addiction to crack.Still enamoured with rap, he made a guest appearance on WC and the Maad Circle's 1991 debut album, Ain't a Damn Thang Changed; then joined a collective called the 40 Thevz before signing a solo deal with Tommy Boy records - the influential label that played home to De La Soul, Naughty By Nature and House Of Pain.His first album, It Takes a Thief, arrived in 1994, and was praised for its combination of funky grooves and socially-conscious lyrics. The musician's message was exemplified by the "hilarious" video for Fantastic Voyage, said Source magazine."As the Lakeside groove carries you along, Coolio piles about six milion people into the trunk of his '64 and takes them to a magical land where race, poverty, gangs and sexual orientation don't matter and everybody was cool."Hip-hop's gatekeepers were not interested in such idealism. Ivey's anti-violence, pro-acceptance stance somehow made him "soft". He earned the unwelcome nickname "Un-Coolio".But then came Gangsta's Paradise.One day, Doug Rasheed pulled out his copy of Stevie Wonder's 1976 double-album Songs In The Key Of Life and cut a sample from Pastime Paradise, a bleak and anxious track that was one of the first songs to replace an orchestra with synthesized strings.Rasheed added a crunching beat and a menacing synth bass, then took the track to singer Larry "LV" Sanders, who laid down a vocal for the chorus."I came in singing 'Pastime Paradise,' but then I changed it up to 'Gangsta's Paradise,'" he told Rolling Stone for an oral history of the song in 2015. "I did my parts, all the vocals and the chorus, and I did the choir. That whole choir that you hear was actually me - I did all the parts from soprano down to tenor to the bass."LV wanted a rapper to appear on the track, and offered it to his friend Prodeje, who declined. Then Coolio overheard it.Mesmerised, he started writing lyrics straight away. The opening lyric, which riffs on Psalm 23, came to him instantly: "As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death/I take a look at my life and realise there's not much left.""I freestyled the whole first line, then I sat down, I picked up a pen and I started to write," he told the YouTube series Hot Ones in 2016."It was divine intervention. I was an instrument and the song was the entity. It wrote itself."Coolio was 30 at the time the song was written, but the narrator is 23 and he doesn't know if he'll live to see 24. He was "raised by the street", immersed a life of crime and retribution. If anyone crosses him, they'll end up "lined in chalk". But the story never glorifies the gangster lifestyle. The narrator prays every night, aware that he's trapped. In the final verse, he accuses the system of letting him down."They say I gotta learn, but nobody's here to teach me / If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?"It's a bleak story. One that could only have been told with the perspective Coolio gained from his teenage years. And the rapper bristled when his song was lumped in with the so-called "gangster rap" scene."I'm trying to get rid of that jacket that's been put on my back - that I'm a gangsta rapper," he said in 1995. "That's not my thing."My thing is to be true to myself and try to educate and entertain kids. When I make references [to the gangster lifestyle], I'm trying to get kids' attention using language they want to hear."Then I can take them to a deeper level. I'm just trying to get a better understanding of myself and a better understanding of other people."Gangsta's Paradise was a stark departure from the feel-good funk of Coolio's first album and, at first, his record label weren't sure what to make of it. "I called my A&amp;R at Tommy Boy Records, and I played it for him. He said, 'It sounds pretty good - I think it would make a good album cut.' Those were his exact words!"Incensed, the star's manager decided to shop the song around to movie studios. It nearly ended up on the soundtrack to the Will Smith film Bad Boys, but was eventually placed in the Disney movie Dangerous Minds - the true story of a former Marine who turns around a troubled inner-city high school by teaching them poetry and Bob Dylan lyrics.A lukewarm retread of Dead Poets Society, it was allegedly testing badly with audiences until Coolio's song started getting played on MTV. The video, like the film, starred Michelle Pfeiffer, who went face-to-face with Coolio as a camera spun around them."She was real nice," Coolio told Kiss FM's Rap show at the time. "She brought her son down to the shoot with her and she was cool. We had no problems."He was less enamoured with the movie itself, though."I hate those kinds of movies where, you know, the great white hope comes into the inner-city neighbourhood and saves the little children - 'Ooh la la, hey Santa Claus!' or whatever, all those kinds of things put it in play," he told Yahoo two years ago. "Those kinds of moments happen very few and far between. It's not that many people that care about each other [in real life]."According to Rolling Stone's oral history, the producers of Dangerous Minds, Coolio was paid $100,000 (£92,000) for Gangsta's Paradise. There was only one problem: Stevie Wonder hadn't cleared the sample."When Stevie heard it, he was like, "No, no way. I'm not letting my song be used in some gangster song,'" the star recalled. Luckily, Coolio's then-wife Josefa Salinas, knew Wonder's brother. "I guess he had been trying to tap that for years," he joked in the Rolling Stone article. "She made a call to him, got a meeting with Stevie and talked him into it. His only stipulation was that I had to take the curse words out."That edit undoubtedly changed Coolio's life. A profane version of Gangsta's Paradise would never have been played on pop radio, or entered heavy rotation on MTV. When it hit number one, it opened up new possibilities for hip-hop... although, to some, it marked the end of an era."America suddenly realised it could sell non-party rap to Brit panty-waists, and that's exactly what it's done ever since," wrote music journalist Garry Mulholland in his book This Is Uncool: The 500 Greatest Singles Since Punk And Disco."In many ways, Gangsta's Paradise signalled the end of gangsta, or 'reality' rap as a cult. It lost the allure of the forbidden when you mum started singing along."Coolio was ambivalent about the song too, often lamenting how its success overshadowed his other work."It's a blessing and a curse at the same time," he said. "For people that really like Gangsta's Paradise, that's all they really want to hear."In recent years, however, the musician came to appreciate the song's legacy, and his role in hip-hop history."People would kill to take my place," he said in 2018. "I'm sure after I'm long gone from this planet, and from this dimension, people will come back and study my body of work."Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

It stressed that payment details and account passwords were not compromised.Those whose passport or licence numbers were taken - roughly 2.8 million people - are at a "quite significant" risk of identity theft and fraud, the government has since said.Optus said it was investigating the breach and had notified police, financial institutions, and government regulators. The breach appears to have originated overseas, local media reported. In an emotional apology, Optus chief executive Kelly Bayer Rosmarin called it a "sophisticated attack", saying the company has very strong cybersecurity."Obviously, I am angry that there are people out there that want to do this to our customers, and I'm disappointed that we couldn't have prevented it," she said on Friday. Early on Saturday, an internet user published data samples on an online forum and demanded a ransom of $1m (A$1.5m; £938,000) in cryptocurrency from Optus.The company had a week to pay or the other stolen data would be sold off in batches, the person said.Investigators are yet to verify the user's claims, but some experts quickly said the sample data - which contained about 100 records - appeared legitimate.Sydney-based tech reporter Jeremy Kirk contacted the purported hacker and said the person gave him a detailed explanation of how they stole the data.The user contradicted Optus's claims the breach was "sophisticated", saying they pulled the data from a freely accessible software interface."No authenticate needed… All open to internet for any one to use," they said in a message, according to Kirk.In another escalation on Tuesday, the person claiming to be the hacker released 10,000 customer records and reiterated the ransom deadline.But just hours later, the user apologised - saying it had been a "mistake" - and deleted the previously posted data sets."Too many eyes. We will not sale [sic] data to anyone," they posted. "Deepest apology to Optus for this. Hope all goes well from this."That sparked speculation about whether Optus had paid the ransom - which the company denies - or whether the user had been spooked by the police investigation.Adding to the problem, others on the forum had copied the now-deleted data sets, and continued to distribute them.It also emerged some customers' Medicare details - government identification numbers that could provide access to medical records - had also been stolen, something Optus did not previously disclose. Late on Wednesday, the company said this had affected almost 37,000 Medicare cards.  Optus has been inundated with messages from angry customers since last week. People have been warned to watch out for signs of identity theft and for opportunistic scammers, who are said to be already cashing in on the confusion. A class-action lawsuit could soon be filed against the company. "This is potentially the most serious privacy breach in Australian history, both in terms of the number of affected people and the nature of the information disclosed," said Ben Zocco from Slater and Gordon Lawyers.The government has called the breach "unprecedented" and blamed Optus, saying it "effectively left the window open" for sensitive data to be stolen.In an ABC television interview on Monday, Cyber Security Minister Clare O'Neil was asked: "You certainly don't seem to be buying the line from Optus that this was a sophisticated attack?""Well, it wasn't. So no," Ms O'Neil replied. The moment drew lots of attention online. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterMs Bayer Rosmarin told News Corp Australia on Tuesday: "We have multiple layers of protection. So it is not the case of having some sort of completely exposed APIs [software interfaces] sitting out there."I think most customers understand that we are not the villains," she said, adding Optus could not say more while the investigation was ongoing.The company has faced calls to cover the costs of replacement passport and driving licences, as people scramble to protect themselves.The breach highlights how much Australia lags behind other parts of the world on privacy and cyber issues, Ms O'Neil says."We are probably a decade behind… where we ought to be," she told the ABC.Australia probes firms over customer 'faceprints' Australia's Nine TV network hit by cyber-attackBoth sides of politics have traded blame on the issue. Opposition MPs have said the Labor government is "asleep at the wheel", but the government points out it was only elected in May after a decade of conservative rule.Ms O'Neil pointed to two areas needing urgent reform.She argues the government should be able to better penalise companies like Optus. In some countries, the company would have faced hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties but Australia's fine is capped at about $2m, she said.She also wants to expand cyber-security laws that were introduced last year to include telecommunications companies."At the time, the telecommunications sector said: "Don't worry about us - we're really good at cybersecurity. We'll do it without being regulated. I would say that this incident really calls that assertion into question."Security experts have also suggested reforming data retention laws so telecommunication companies don't have to keep sensitive information for so long. Ex-customers should also have the right to request companies delete their data, experts say.Optus says it is required to keep identity data for six years under the current rules.Other industry figures have argued consumers should be able to take companies that lose control of their information to court, instead of the industry regulator.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Katy Watson"><Text>In the second of two profiles of the leading candidates in the race to become Brazil's new president, Katy Watson asks if Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is the same person who took the world by storm 20 years ago.It is no coincidence that Lula chose the Amazon as one of his key destinations on the campaign trail. The 76-year-old's main rival in the presidential election on 2 October, far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, has been accused of destroying the rainforest. Lula knows that climate issues have soared to the top of the political agenda and in Manaus, the biggest city in the Amazon, he told reporters "the planet needs special attention from all of us"."We need to look after our forest, our fauna, our water, but most of all, we need to look after our people because they're struggling, they're in need and they need to live with dignity," he said. "We can reclaim this country, it's possible to once again walk with our heads held high."Lula chose the Museum of the Amazon to meet indigenous leaders and talk about the future of the forest. "Nobody wants to turn the Amazon into an untouchable world sanctuary," he told the audience. "What we want is to benefit from our wealth, our biodiversity." By saying that, the former president shows that he is aware of his rival's message. President Bolsonaro is at great pains to say that the rest of the world needs to stop meddling in Brazil's affairs.It is 20 years since Lula won the presidency for the first time. A former metal worker and union leader, he became a familiar face during the strikes of the 1970s, when workers called for higher wages, defying Brazil's military rulers.He came to power promising change. Helped by high commodity prices, he spent the windfalls on areas such as higher education and welfare programmes that contributed to lifting millions of Brazilians out of poverty. Described by former US President Barack Obama as "the most popular politician on Earth", Lula left office after eight years in power with an approval rating of more than 80%.Like him or hate him, he was a politician unlike any other. But in recent years, that legacy has been tainted with his party - and Lula himself - hit by corruption scandals. In 2017, he was sentenced to nine years in prison. His convictions were quashed four years later, but his brush with the law means that he is no longer just seen as the "saviour" of Brazil. Instead, many millions of Brazilians see him as a corrupt politician unfit for office.Given that split among voters, I asked him how he thought he could convince the electorate he is the right man to lead Brazil. "Deaths [like that] of Dom Phillips and Bruno Pereira can't ever happen again," he said, skirting the question with a reference to the killing in June of a British journalist and an indigenous expert in the Amazon."Brazil needs to be transformed into a civilised country, it can't fall victim to inhumane people," he added. "I am convinced that we need to change Brazil - and changing Brazil means having a government that assumes responsibility for really caring for people."Not far from the centre of Manaus, where Lula spoke, 24-year-old mother-of-three Carol Araújo lives in small community of palafitas - houses that sit on stilts over a small river.Rainy season is coming to an end and the earth below the houses here in the neighbourhood of São Jorge resembles a swamp more than a river.Rubbish is everywhere: broken bottles, old boxes and shoes. In the sweltering heat of Manaus, the stench is overpowering.  Official figures suggest an estimated 63 million people now live in poverty in Brazil, and Carol, who was born in São Jorge, is one of them. She knows nothing but hardship, but she does know who she is going to cast her ballot for. "I'm going to vote for Lula because under him, everything was easier," she says. "But I don't know if [by him] coming back things will improve." It is a risk she is prepared to take. With food and energy prices rising, she cannot make ends meet."I try and find work when it comes my way but it's hard. I have to make it work to feed my children." She says that it comes down to knowing who will help her and those like her, because "during the elections, all the politicians do is make promises".Lula more easily relies on the older generation, which can remember the good times, but he knows he will have to win over the younger generation voting for the first time. "It's a sign of the incapacity of Brazil's elite to renew itself," says Oliver Stuenkel, professor of international relations at the Getúlio Vargas Foundation in São Paulo. "Lula has been running for president since Brazil became a democracy in the late 1980s, and in that sense he is very much a key personality of Brazil's transition from autocracy to democracy. But he struggles to point to the future, he's very much a throwback."But while this is the same Lula, he will not be in charge of the same Brazil. Economic crises and more political polarisation set the country apart from what he inherited the first time.For supporter Beth Ferreira, that does not matter. "I am crazy about Lula - Brazil needs him because we are in decline," she says. "When he started in 2003, Brazil was in the same situation, it was devastated. And we think he can do the same thing - our hope never dies."</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By David Gritten"><Text>Iran's supreme leader has blamed the US and Israel for the anti-government protests sweeping the country, in his first public comments on the unrest.Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said "riots" had been "engineered" by Iran's arch-enemies and their allies, and alleged that Qurans had been burned.He also called on security forces to be ready to deal with further unrest.The protests - the biggest challenge to his rule for a decade - were sparked by the death in custody of a woman.Mahsa Amini, 22, fell into a coma hours after being detained by morality police on 13 September in Tehran for allegedly breaking the strict law requiring women to cover their hair with a hijab, or headscarf. She died three days later.Her family has alleged that officers beat her head with a baton and banged her head against one of their vehicles. The police have said there is no evidence of any mistreatment and that she suffered "sudden heart failure".Women have led the protests that began after Ms Amini's funeral, waving their headscarves in the air or setting them on fire to chants of "Woman, life, freedom" and "Death to the dictator" - a reference to Ayatollah Khamenei.The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterAddressing a graduation ceremony of police and armed forces cadets on Monday, the supreme leader said Ms Amini's death "broke our hearts"."But what is not normal is that some people, without proof or an investigation, have made the streets dangerous, burned the Quran, removed hijabs from veiled women and set fire to mosques and cars," he added, without mentioning any specific incidents. The ayatollah, who has the final say on all state matters, asserted that foreign powers had planned "rioting" because they could not tolerate Iran "attaining strength in all spheres"."I say clearly that these riots and the insecurity were engineered by America and the occupying, false Zionist regime [Israel], as well as their paid agents, with the help of some traitorous Iranians abroad."He also gave his full backing to the security forces, saying that they had faced "injustice" during the unrest.Iran Human Rights, a Norway-based group, said on Sunday that at least 133 people had been killed by security forces so far. They include 41 protesters whom ethnic Baluch activists said had died in clashes in Zahedan on Friday.State media have reported that more than 40 people have been killed, including security personnel.Ayatollah Khamenei's comments came a day after security forces violently cracked down on a protest by students at Iran's most prestigious science and engineering university, reportedly arresting dozens.The BBC's Kasra Naji says the gunfire heard around the campus of Sharif University of Technology in Tehran on Sunday night spread fear among many Iranians that authorities had decided to make an example of the students.Security forces tried to the enter the campus, but the students drove them back and closed all the entrance gates.But, our correspondent adds, a siege developed and the students who tried to leave through an adjacent car park were picked up one by one and beaten, blindfolded and taken away.In one video posted on social media, a large number of people are seen running inside a car park while being pursued by men on motorbikes. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterThe siege was lifted later in the night following the intervention of professors and a government minister. On Monday, students at the university announced that they would not go back to classes until all of their fellow students had been released from detention. The university meanwhile said it had moved classes online, citing "the need to protect students".Protests were also reported at several other universities around the country. </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Valdya Baraputri and Raja Lumbanrau in Malang, Matt Murphy in London"><Text>Football fans "died in the arms" of players during a crush at Indonesia's Kanjuruhan stadium, the home team coach has said, as the number of children killed in the tragedy rose to 32.Javier Roca said the crush at the match in Java, in which 125 people lost their lives, left him "mentally shattered". Authorities say the youngest victim of Saturday's disaster was just three. Some 18 officers are being investigated after police fired tear gas at fans who invaded the pitch when the match ended.More than 320 other people were injured as supporters were trampled on and suffocated in crushes as they fled the gas. Indonesia's deputy minister of children and women affairs said the children were aged between three and 17. An eyewitness told the BBC that police had fired numerous gas rounds "continuously and fast" after the situation with fans became "tense". Home team Arema FC supporters ran onto the pitch when the match ended in a 3-2 defeat to their rivals Persebaya Surabaya.Videos on social media show fans clambering over fences to escape. Separate videos appeared to show lifeless bodies on the floor.One witness, Chandra, told the BBC that a sea of smoke in the stands caused instant panic among spectators. "Little kids were crying, women were fainting, screams were heard everywhere, all were flocking out," he said. Another fan, Eko, said he couldn't get out of the stand's exits due to the number of people trying to escape. "I went back to the top of the stands with friends. Then I used a scarf to keep the smoke away. After that I jumped into the field and went down through the side door," he said.Ester Andayanengtyas told the BBC her 17-year-old daughter Debora suffered serious injuries, including a broken neck and swelling on the brain during the panic. "I asked her not to watch the game that day. She didn't return home, in the morning her friends were looking for her," Ms Andayanengtyas said. "We looked for her in the ER, but she wasn't there. The hospital told us to look at the mortuary. The confusion happened because my daughter didn't carry an ID." Other witnesses reported hearing parents crying out "where is my child" among the chaos, and one man told the BBC that he saw parents collapsing while protecting their children. "A mother fainted while hugging her child, next to her the boy fainted," he said. "Then some supporters picked up the mother and the boy to get out of the stadium. They were carried away unconscious - maybe because of the tear gas."Muhamad Dipo Maulana, 21, who was at the match, told BBC Indonesian that after the game had ended a few Arema fans went on the pitch to remonstrate with the home team players but were immediately intercepted by police and "beaten".More spectators then took to the pitch in protest, the supporter said."Police with dogs, shields, and soldiers came forward," Mr Dipo told the BBC. He said he had heard more than 20 tear gas shots towards spectators at the stadium.Police spokesperson Dedi Prasetyo told reporters that the officers under investigation "were responsible for holding" the weapons and said they were being questioned by an internal affairs team. A police chief has now been sacked following the investigation.He added that several other officers, including the field security team, and some officials from the Indonesian football league, were also under investigation. Indonesia's human rights commission said it will conduct its own inquiry into the disaster, and President Joko Widodo has ordered that all matches in Indonesia's top league must be stopped until the official probe has been carried out. Amnesty International said the police response amounted to "use of excessive force by the state" to control an unarmed crowd, and protesters in the capital Jakarta on Sunday night carried placards that read "stop police brutality". Indonesia's police force has been previously criticised for its frequent use of tear gas in tightly-packed stadiums.Meanwhile, Mr Roca, the Arema FC coach, told the Spanish broadcaster Cadena Ser that he thought "the police overstepped their mark" in efforts to control the crowd. The announcement of the investigation comes after world football's governing body Fifa called the disaster "a dark day for all involved in football and a tragedy beyond comprehension". Fifa's own regulations say no "crowd control gas" should be carried or used by stewards or police at matches and the body has requested a report on the incident from the Indonesian football federation. Security Minister Mahfud MD wrote on Instagram that the stadium had been filled beyond capacity, with over 42,000 tickets being sold for the game in the 38,000 capacity stadium. "It had gotten anarchic. They started attacking officers, they damaged cars," said Nico Afinta, police chief in East Java, adding that two police officers were among the dead."We would like to convey that... not all of them were anarchic. Only about 3,000 who entered the pitch," he said.Fleeing fans "went out to one point at the exit. Then there was a build-up, in the process of accumulation there was shortness of breath, lack of oxygen", the officer added.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Vanessa Buschschlüter"><Text>Brazil's election is going into a second round in which left-winger Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva will face far-right incumbent Jair Bolsonaro.With almost all the votes counted, Lula had won 48% against Bolsonaro's 43% - a much closer result than opinion polls had suggested.But Lula fell short of the more than 50% of valid votes needed to prevent a run-off. Voters now have four weeks to decide which of the two should lead Brazil.Winning outright in the first round was always going to be a tall order for any candidate - the last time it happened was 24 years ago.But President Bolsonaro and Lula had given their supporters hope that they could achieve just that.Both candidates can and will claim this as a victory, though. Lula has already said that this is a "mere delay" on his way to the presidency.For the 76-year-old former metal worker - who could not run in the 2018 election because he was in prison after being convicted on corruption charges which were later annulled - this spells a remarkable comeback.And President Bolsonaro, whom opinion polls had shown trailing far behind Lula, will rejoice in the fact that he proved the pollsters wrong, just as he had predicted he would. A race that is far from overWhy Brazil's election matters so much to the US'Our candidate isn't perfect, but he beats the alternative'This is a drama which has been years in the making. The two men are arch-rivals and spent much of the campaign trading insults.In the last TV debate before the vote, President Bolsonaro called Lula a thief, in reference to the corruption charges that put him in jail for 580 days before the conviction was annulled. Lula, who has always maintained that the charges against him were politically motivated, has labelled Mr Bolsonaro a madman.Not surprisingly, that tension has filtered down into the streets. During the nights before the vote, neighbours here in Rio could be heard shouting "Lula is a thief" and "Out with Bolsonaro" at each other.  Since the two candidates are such polar opposites, much is at stake.Lula says he will bolster measures to protect the Amazon rainforest, while Mr Bolsonaro has argued that parts of the rainforest should be opened up to economic exploitation.Deforestation and forest fires have soared during President Bolsonaro's time in office. Climate activists have warned that if he is re-elected, the area could reach a tipping point. Critics point out that Lula's environmental record during his time in office - he governed Brazil from 2003 to 2010 - was far from perfect.  But with Mr Bolsonaro counting on the agricultural sector and agribusiness for votes and support, it is Lula who is the preferred choice of climate activists. However, voters in Brazil have many other pressing concerns, such as rising food prices, which have contributed to an increase in poverty and hunger.Mr Bolsonaro acknowledged these concerns in a statement after the results were out. "I understand that a lot of the vote was down to the situation the Brazilian people are in. They are feeling the price rises, especially those of basic goods. I do understand that there's a desire for change but some change can be for the worse," he warned. Many voters also mentioned education and Brazil's high levels of inequality as issues they want the new president to tackle. Much of the campaign, however, was overshadowed by concern that Mr Bolsonaro may not accept defeat after he had said that "only God" could remove him from office. He had also cast doubts on Brazil's electronic voting system, alleging - without providing any evidence - that it was open to fraud. With the result much more favourable to him than predicted, he is now likely to concentrate more on how to sway those voters who cast their ballot for one of the other nine candidates who were eliminated in the first round.All eyes will now be on centrist Senator Simone Tebet, who came third in the election with 4%, and centre-left candidate Ciro Gomes, who came fourth with 3%. Both said that they would announce "in the coming days" who they would throw their weight behind for the run-off. Lula, who seems to thrive on overcoming obstacles, has already announced that "the fight continues until the final victory, that's our motto".</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Ben Tobias"><Text>Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov says his three sons, aged 14, 15 and 16, will soon travel to the Ukraine front line to fight with Russian forces. Kadyrov is a strong ally of Vladimir Putin, although has recently criticised Russian military leadership.On social media, he wrote that a father should teach his sons how to protect their family, people and fatherland. Russia has signed a UN treaty aimed at preventing children under the age of 18 from taking direct part in hostilities.Using children under the age of 15 to participate in hostilities is considered a war crime by the International Criminal Court. However Russia does not recognise its jurisdiction.In a long post on the Telegram messaging app, Kadyrov said his sons' military training began when they were much younger, and the time had come for them to experience a real battle. He also took aim at those "empty-worded" people who claimed the Chechen leader's loved-ones were not taking part in the military operation in Ukraine. The post was accompanied by a slickly-produced video of his sons firing various weapons at a training ground. Kadyrov has ruled the southern Russian republic since 2007, when he was named the region's president by Vladimir Putin. It has been a period of relative stability in Chechnya, which fought unsuccessfully for independence for a decade. But Kadyrov has been criticised for ruling with an iron fist, and allowing human rights violations to flourish. Kadyrov is a fierce supporter of Vladimir Putin, and Chechen forces have been fighting in Ukraine since the start of the war. However, after recent military setbacks in the Kharkiv and Donetsk regions, he criticised Russia's military leadership, describing one commander as a "mediocrity" and bemoaning a lack of basic logistics.He also called for Russia to take more drastic measures against Ukraine, including the use of a tactical nuclear weapon. The Kremlin responded that decisions like that should not be made emotionally.Kadyrov's criticism was in response to the retreat of Russian forces from the Ukrainian town of Lyman in Donetsk region - a major strategic setback for Moscow.Capturing the town is important for Ukrainian forces, because it can be used as a foothold to reach further into Russian-held parts of Ukraine. It was also being used by Russia as a logistics hub.The defeat in Lyman was also symbolic, as it happened just a day after a grand signing ceremony to annex four occupied regions of Ukraine - including Donetsk, where Lyman is situated. Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions all held so-called referendums on joining Russia last month, which were dismissed as a "sham" by Ukraine and its Western allies. On Sunday evening, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukrainian troops had also recaptured some territory in the Kherson region. Its Russian-installed head, Vladimir Saldo, described the situation there as "tense" and admitted Ukrainian forces had made breakthroughs. None of the four regions newly claimed by Russia are completely under Russian control, raising the question of how annexation will work - particularly in Ukrainian-controlled territory. The Kremlin says it will "consult" with residents of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions over where the borders should lie, suggesting that Russia may decide not to lay claim to the entire regions. In Luhansk and Donetsk the situation is different. Just before the war began Mr Putin recognised the whole of those regions as independent republics, which have now - as Moscow sees it - voted to join Russia. </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="BBC News, author unspecified"><Text>Kim Kardashian has agreed to pay a $1.26m (£1.12m) fine for advertising EthereumMax on her Instagram page.The US Securities and Exchange Commission said the reality TV star had received $250,000 for advertising the cryptocurrency, without disclosing she had been paid to do so.She also agreed not to promote crypto asset securities for three years.Her lawyer told BBC News: "Ms Kardashian is pleased to have resolved this matter with the SEC."The lawyer said: "Kardashian fully cooperated with the SEC from the very beginning and she remains willing to do whatever she can to assist the SEC in this matter. "She wanted to get this matter behind her to avoid a protracted dispute. "The agreement she reached with the SEC allows her to do that so that she can move forward with her many different business pursuits."Ms Kardashian, boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr, basketball player Paul Pierce and EthereumMax's creators were sued by investors in January.The legal action alleged they had collaborated to "misleadingly promote and sell" the cryptocurrency in a "pump and dump" scheme designed to inflate the price before selling to investors.EthereumMax disputed the allegations at the time.In spite of its name, EthereumMax has no legal or business connection with the Ethereum cryptocurrency.Anyone can create a crypto coin.All you need is a few pounds, a YouTube tutorial and a funky name.This month alone, dozens of new tokens will be launched, with creators promising their coin will be the next big thing.With little intrinsic value to the product, marketing is key - and as in many modern industries, celebrities can be the make or break. EthereumMax put a huge amount of money into snapping up celebrities such as Kim Kardashian - and at first, it seemed to be working out. But as with many crypto coins, the fall was as dramatic as the rise. Even if EthereumMax had retained the value it gained after the celebrity pump, regulators both in the US and UK were extremely uncomfortable about the marketing of the coin.The crypto industry is still largely unregulated - but Kim Kardashian joins a growing list of people and companies being punished for promoting these highly risky products.Gary Gensler, who chairs the SEC, called the case a "reminder" celebrity endorsement did not necessarily make a product worth investing in."Ms Kardashian's case also serves as a reminder to celebrities and others that the law requires them to disclose to the public when and how much they are paid to promote investing in securities," he said.Later, in a YouTube video about crypto investment, he added: "Celebrity endorsements... don't mean that an investment product is right for you or even, frankly, that it's legitimate."Even if a celebrity endorsement is genuine, each investment has its own risk and opportunities."When it comes to crypto, remember many of these are highly speculative assets. "You may be wondering if it's right for you or even if it might be a scam."</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By James Gallagher"><Text>The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine has gone to Sweden's Svante Paabo for his work on human evolution. The Prize committee said he achieved the seemingly impossible task of cracking the genetic code of one of our extinct relatives - Neanderthals.He also performed the "sensational" feat of discovering the previously unknown relative - Denisovans.His work helped explore our own evolutionary history and how humans spread around the planet. The Swedish geneticist's work gets to the heart of some of the most fundamental questions - where do we come from and what allowed us, Homo sapiens, to succeed while our relatives went extinct.He was just off to pick his daughter up from a sleepover when he got the call saying he'd won. He told the BBC: "I was very surprised and overwhelmed, I had not expected this." The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterIn the 1990s, research on working out the human genetic code was taking place at pace. But that relied on fresh samples of pristine DNA.Prof Paabo's interest was in the old, degraded and contaminated genetic material from our ancestors. Many thought it was an impossible challenge. But he was, for the first time, able to sequence DNA from a 40,000-year-old piece of bone.Those results showed that Neanderthals - who mostly lived in Europe and Western Asia - were distinct from both modern day humans and chimpanzees.His work focused on hominins - the group of modern humans that includes us, Homo sapiens, but also our extinct relatives. "By revealing genetic differences that distinguish all living humans from extinct hominins, his discoveries provide the basis for exploring what makes us uniquely human", the Nobel committee said.BBC Podcast: Svante Paabo on the difference between us and NeanderthalsFurther comparisons between Neanderthal DNA and humans from around the world showed their DNA was a closer match to humans coming from Europe or Asia. This tells us that Homo sapiens had sex and children with Neanderthals after migrating out of Africa around 70,000 years ago. And you can still see the legacy of that today. Between 1-4% of modern human DNA comes from our Neanderthal relatives and this even affects our body's ability to respond to infection.The next seismic contribution to human origins came in 2008. Scientists had found a 40,000-year-old finger bone in the Denisova cave, in Siberia.Prof Paabo was able to sequence a sample of DNA and the results showed it was a previously unknown hominin - known as Denisovans. And it turned out Homo sapiens bred with Denisovans too. In parts of South East Asia up to 6% of people's DNA is Denisovan. Some of this genetic inheritance helps the body cope with low levels of oxygen, aids survival at high altitudes and is found in present-day Tibetans. Prof Paabo only heard the news this morning when he was called by Thomas Perlmann, the secretary for the Nobel Committee for Physiology or Medicine."He was overwhelmed, he was speechless. Very happy," said Prof Perlmann.Prof Paabo is seen as one of the founders of the scientific discipline of paleogenomics. He wins the 10m Swedish kronor (£800,000) prize. He follows in the footsteps of his father, Sune Bergstrom, who won the same Nobel Prize in 1982.His work shows there were already two distinct groups of hominins (Neanderthals and Denisovans) living in Eurasia when Homo sapiens spread from Africa.Analysis suggests these now extinct populations were small and relatively inbred and may not have been able to compete with rapidly expanding modern humans.Follow James on Twitter2021 - David Julius and Ardem Patapoutian for their work on how the body senses touch and temperature. 2020 - Michael Houghton, Harvey Alter and Charles Rice for the discovery of the virus Hepatitis C.2019 - Sir Peter Ratcliffe, William Kaelin and Gregg Semenza for discovering how cells sense and adapt to oxygen levels2018 - James P Allison and Tasuku Honjo for discovering how to fight cancer using the body's immune system2017- Jeffrey Hall, Michael Rosbash and Michael Young for unravelling how bodies keep a circadian rhythm or body clock2016 - Yoshinori Ohsumi for discovering how cells remain healthy by recycling waste2015 - William C Campbell, Satoshi Ōmura and Youyou Tu for anti-parasite drug discoveries</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Jasmine Andersson"><Text>King Charles will host the first state visit of his reign next month when he welcomes the president of South Africa to Buckingham Palace.President Cyril Ramaphosa and his wife, First Lady Tshepo Motsepe, have accepted an invitation to visit the King and Queen Consort.The visit will take place from Tuesday November 22 to Thursday November 24.It is understood the trip was in the early stages of being planned before the Queen's death in September.It will be the first time a South African leader has visited the UK in an official capacity in more than a decade, with the last state visit being in 2010 when Jacob Zuma visited the late Queen.The King has visited South Africa on a number of occasions since his first tour of the country in 1997, which included stops in Pretoria, Johannesburg, Durban and Cape Town.He last travelled to the country in 2011, with the Queen Consort. It was not a state event.The Queen shared a particularly close relationship with Nelson Mandela, the first democratically elected president of South Africa. The pair were said to have enjoyed a warm friendship, and unusually, referred to each other by their first names.Mr Ramaphosa, who has been in power since 2018, is the fourth leader of South Africa since Mr Mandela. State visits are an exercise in soft power and red carpets, filled with royal ceremony and banquets, but focused on the hard-headed business of strengthening international relationships.It's the Foreign Office that advises on which countries are invited - the last being US President Donald Trump in 2019, before Covid stopped any further state visits.It's pomp with a purpose against a backdrop of pageantry, photo ops and the jangle of a royal carriage ride. Even the paintings and items on view from the Royal Collection can be changed to set the right tone.For the first time it will be King Charles who will now be the host at Buckingham Palace, proposing the toast to the South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa.Charles was a guest at the state banquet in 1996 when Nelson Mandela paid a state visit, after post-apartheid South Africa had rejoined the Commonwealth.The new King will want to build his own bridges with the Commonwealth, sending a message about supporting diversity and multiculturalism.When he arrives, Mr Ramaphosa will be given a ceremonial welcome on Horse Guards Parade, and then invited to a state banquet hosted by the monarch. He is expected to spend the rest of their trip visiting Prime Minister Liz Truss, government ministers and leaders of the main political parties. But Mr Ramaphosa's visit is clouded by allegations of money laundering.The rolling scandal, which erupted in June, has seen Mr Ramaphosa accused of covering up of a robbery that took place at his private farm in February 2020.He has repeatedly denied the allegations and insists he will stand for a second term in the 2024 national elections as ANC leader and president.

The company says it only uses sawdust and waste wood.Panorama analysed satellite images, traced logging licences and used drone filming to prove its findings. Reporter Joe Crowley also followed a truck from a Drax mill to verify it was picking up whole logs from an area of precious forest. Ecologist Michelle Connolly told Panorama the company was destroying forests that had taken thousands of years to develop."It's really a shame that British taxpayers are funding this destruction with their money. Logging natural forests and converting them into pellets to be burned for electricity, that is absolutely insane," she said.The row over the UK's largest power plantThe Drax power station in Yorkshire is a converted coal plant, which now produces 12% of the UK's renewable electricity.It has already received £6bn in green energy subsidies. Burning wood is considered green, but it is controversial among environmentalists. Panorama discovered Drax bought logging licences to cut down two areas of environmentally-important forest in British Columbia.One of the Drax forests is a square mile, including large areas that have been identified as rare, old-growth forest.The provincial government of British Columbia says old-growth forests are particularly important and that companies should put off logging them.Drax's own responsible sourcing policy says it "will avoid damage or disturbance" to primary and old-growth forest.  However, the latest satellite pictures show Drax is now cutting down the forest. The company told Panorama many of the trees there had died, and that logging would reduce the risk of wildfires. The entire area covered by the second Drax logging licence has already been cut down.  Burning wood produces more greenhouse gases than burning coal. The electricity is classed as renewable because new trees are planted to replace the old ones and these new trees should recapture the carbon emitted by burning wood pellets. But recapturing the carbon takes decades and the off-setting can only work if the pellets are made with wood from sustainable sources. Primary forests, which have never been logged before and store vast quantities of carbon, are not considered a sustainable source. It is highly unlikely that replanted trees will ever hold as much carbon as the old forest. Drax told the BBC it had not cut down the forests itself and said it transferred the logging licences to other companies. But Panorama checked and the authorities in British Columbia confirmed that Drax still holds the licences.Drax said it did not use the logs from the two sites Panorama identified. It said they were sent to timber mills - to make wood products - and that Drax only used the leftover sawdust for its pellets.The company says it does use some logs - in general - to make wood pellets. It claims it only uses ones that are small, twisted, or rotten.But documents on a Canadian forestry database show that only 11% of the logs delivered to the two Drax plants in the past year were classified as the lowest quality, which cannot be used for wood products. Panorama wanted to see if logs from primary forests cut down by logging companies were being transferred to Drax's Meadowbank pellet plant. The programme filmed a truck on a 120-mile round trip: leaving the plant, collecting piles of whole logs from a forest that had been cut down by a logging company and then returning to the plant for their delivery.Drax later admitted that it did use logs from the forest to make wood pellets. The company said they were species the timber industry did not want, and they would often be burned anyway to reduce wildfire risks. The company also said the sites identified by Panorama were not primary forest because they were near roads. But the UN definitions of primary forest do not mention proximity to roads and one of the sites is six miles from the nearest paved road.Panorama's findings come at a critical moment for Drax.The UK government is due to publish a new biomass strategy later this year, which will set out its policy for natural fuels like wood.A Drax spokesperson said 80% of material in its Canadian pellets is sawmill residuals, which would be disposed of anyway. They also said that Drax applies stringent sustainability standards to its own pellet production as well as suppliers, with verification from third-party certification schemes. "We are constantly reviewing these policies to ensure we take account of the latest science," they added.Panorama's The Green Energy Scandal Exposed is on BBC One at 20:00 on Monday 3rd October and on iPlayer afterwards</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Paul Glynn"><Text>Sacheen Littlefeather, the Native American activist who declined Marlon Brando's Oscar for The Godfather on his behalf in 1973, has died aged 75.The actress, who had breast cancer, died on Sunday, the Academy announced.Her death comes two weeks after the organisation honoured her at a ceremony in Los Angeles, publicly apologising for her treatment at the Oscars.Littlefeather, of Apache and Yaqui heritage, was booed while speaking on stage at the event 50 years ago.Dressed in full Apache attire during the first Oscars to be televised around the world, the Californian, born Maria Cruz, explained on Brando's behalf that he would not accept his best actor gong for the mafia movie in order to protest against the treatment of Native Americans by the film industry and to bring attention to the Wounded Knee protests.To whom does Wounded Knee belong? In 1973, several hundred locals, together with radical activists from the American Indian Movement (AIM), poured into the nearby village of Wounded Knee in South Dakota to protest government abuse.The protest resulted in a violent stand-off with federal agents that went on for 71 days."I went up there, like a proud Indian woman with dignity, with courage, with grace, and with humility," she remembered at the recent event."I knew that I had to speak the truth. Some people may accept it. And some people may not."Screen Actors Guild member Littlefeather struggled to get work in the industry afterwards but said it was "never too late for an apology... it's never too late for forgiveness."In a recent interview with Variety, she said she had made the Oscars speech in order to honour her ancestors and "native people everywhere"."I was met with the stereotypical tomahawk chop, individuals who called at me, and I ignored all of them," she recalled. "I continued to walk straight ahead with a couple of armed guards beside me, and I held my head high and was proud to be the first Indigenous woman in the history of the Academy Awards to make that political statement. "At that time in 1973, there was a media blackout on Wounded Knee and against the American Indian Movement that was occupying it," she went on. "Marlon had called them in advance and asked them to watch the Academy Awards, which they did."As they saw me, up on stage, refusing that Academy Award for the stereotypes within the film industry, and mentioning Wounded Knee in South Dakota, it would break the media boycott."In 2020, Littlefeather told the BBC that straight after the speech she had to leave the stage with two security guards. But, she added, it "was a very good thing" as actor John Wayne was backstage. She said he was "furious with Marlon and furious with me" and wanted to pull her off stage himself.Littlefeather featured in films like The Trial of Billy Jack, Johnny Firecloud and Counselor at Crime, but said she returned to San Francisco after being blacklisted by the industry, to continue her activism and work in health care and the theatre.Paying tribute online on Monday, Dakota/Lakota Sioux writer and biologist Ruth H. Robertson, aka Red Road Woman, pointed to Littlefeather's work with the American Indian Aids Institute of San Francisco.Lakota Man on Twitter offered: "It's with a heavy heart that I mourn the passing of Sacheen Littlefeather. I wish her a blessed journey", later adding: "Honour her".TV writer Joey Clift said: "When I talk about how our current Native storytelling movement in Hollywood is built on the shoulders of activists fighting tirelessly for decades for Native people to finally get our day in the sun, I'm talking about Sacheen Littlefeather. RIP."The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterIn announcing her death online, the Academy quoted Littlefeather, the subject of the 2021 documentary, Sacheen: Breaking the Silence, saying: "When I am gone, always be reminded that whenever you stand for your truth, you will be keeping my voice and the voices of our nations and our people alive."</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Natasha Booty"><Text>Burkina Faso's new military leader, Capt Ibrahim Traoré, has urged cabinet ministers to "move faster" to fix the country's "urgent" problems, including an insurgency by Islamist militants.The man he ousted in a coup on Friday has formally agreed to step down, religious and community leaders said.They said Capt Traoré had accepted Lt Col Paul-Henri Damiba's resignation and conditions he had set.He has gone to Togo, according to that country's government spokesman.In a recording widely shared on social media, Lt Col Damiba said he wished Burkina Faso's new leader every success. It is not known if he was alone when it was made.On Sunday Capt Traoré said the country was facing an emergency in every sector, "from security to defence, to health, to social action, to infrastructure", and it was time for government to "abandon the unnecessary red tape".He wants fast solutions to big problems, which some fear signals a turn towards Russia.Latest updates on Burkina Faso from BBC Africa LiveWhy France faces so much anger in West AfricaCoups that promised and failed to bring safetyRussia and France are engaged in a battle for influence in several former French colonies in West and Central Africa. At the weekend there were attacks on French institutions, after it was reported that Lt Col Damiba was sheltering at a French military base in the capital, Ouagadougou.France's foreign ministry said they were the work of "hostile demonstrators" who had been "manipulated by a disinformation campaign against us".Some in Ouagadougou chanted pro-Russian slogans and waved Russian flags as they greeted the new junta leader and his convoy on Sunday. He regards former colonial power France as an ally of the man he ousted, and has spoken of his willingness to work with new partners to fight Islamist insurgents - and analysts believe that could mean hiring Russian mercenaries.Russian military contractors are said to be active in neighbouring Mali, after French forces pulled out following a row with that country's military leaders. The Russians are accused by rights groups of committing abuses and massacres of civilians, which Russia has always denied.The head of the Russian mercenary Wagner group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has welcomed the takeover in Burkina Faso. Meanwhile, the Russian government said on Monday it "would like the situation in Burkina Faso to normalise as soon possible".Burkina Faso controls as little as 60% of its territory, experts say, and Islamist violence is worsening.The African Union has demanded the return of constitutional order by July 2023 at the latest, agreeing with the regional group Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) that the ousting of leader Lt Col Damiba was "unconstitutional".But Ecowas has since praised "the various parties in Burkina Faso for agreeing to a peaceful settlement of their differences", as days of power struggles came to an end without bloodshed.Lt Col Damiba formally resigned on Sunday in exchange for the new junta agreeing to respect seven conditions  - including a guarantee of his personal and family security, an agreement to continue with efforts at national reconciliation and a continued respect for the guarantee of returning to civilian rule within two years. The deposed colonel had himself ousted President Roch Kaboré in January, saying that he had failed to deal with growing militant Islamist violence.Many citizens in Burkina Faso have not felt safe for some time.The Islamist insurgency broke out in the country in 2015, leaving thousands dead and forcing an estimated two million people from their homes.This is Burkina Faso's ninth coup since independence from France in 1960.Additional reporting by Alys Davies</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Matt Murphy"><Text>Bulgaria's centre-right GERB party has won the country's parliamentary election, preliminary results show.Led by ex-Prime Minister Boyko Borissov, GERB took 25.4% of votes with 99% of ballots counted, officials said. But the 63-year-old faces a difficult task forming a working coalition, as most other parties have already ruled out working with him. Many of his opponents accuse him of overseeing government corruption during his time in office, which he denies.Mr Borissov has previously served three separate terms in Bulgaria's top job, and tackling graft became a key part of an election last November. Sunday's poll was called after the centrist government led by Kiril Petkov lost a no-confidence vote in June amid soaring inflation. The 42-year-old Harvard educated economist ran on an anti-corruption ticket and had urged voters to let him "continue the change" ahead of the vote. But he conceded defeat on Sunday evening after his We Continue to Change party took just 20.4% of the vote. Mr Petkov told reporters that "GERB has the responsibility to form a coalition and govern the country". He has already ruled out working with Mr Borissov, pledging to be an "opposition scrutinising the spending of every lev". Pundits say Bulgaria now faces an uncertain political outlook. "The situation is the same as after the last election but even more complicated," Daniel Smilov from the Centre for Liberal Strategies, told the BTV network. "Coalitions that were possible then are no longer possible now." Mr Borissov says he is willing to work with any party to form a working government, but is likely to have to rely on two pro-Russian parties and the Turkish minority MRF grouping. "What's important for us is for reason to prevail," he said on Sunday. "Believe me, right now I am the most well-meaning and open person to all parties."Whoever leads Bulgaria's next government, the EU's poorest nation faces a host of challenges. Inflation has continued to soar - hitting 15% in August - as energy prices spiral amid a dispute with the Russian state-owned gas giant Gazprom. And ministers will also face a difficult challenge managing the country's relationship with Moscow, after Mr Petkov's government turned its back on Vladimir Putin's regime in April. Bulgaria is an EU and Nato member, and Mr Borissov recently called President Putin the "clear aggressor" in Russia's war with Ukraine. Final results from Sunday's election are expected to come on Thursday after overseas postal votes are counted.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Omega Rakotomalala &amp; Farouk Chothia"><Text>Said to have been a shy but intelligent boy in school, Burkina Faso's Capt Ibrahim Traoré has become the latest military officer to seize power in a coup in one of France's former colonies in West Africa. He overthrew his former comrade, Lt Col Paul-Henri Damiba on 30 September, after accusing him of failing to fulfil his promise of quelling the Islamist insurgency that has gripped Burkina Faso since 2015.Born in 1988, this makes the 34-year-old captain the youngest head of state in Africa, joining the ranks of two other coup leaders - Guinea's charismatic Col Mamady Doumbouya, born in 1981, and Mali's bearded Col Assimi Goïta, born in 1983."I know I'm younger than most of you here. We didn't want what happened but we didn't have a choice," Capt Traoré told government officials.During Lt-Col Damiba's short time in power, attacks by militant Islamists - some of them linked to the Islamic State group and al-Qaeda - increased in Burkina Faso as they seized territory in rural areas and encircled cities, leaving the state in control of only about 60% of the country, according to some estimates. With a lack of strong democratic institutions in a country where the military has long been dominant, Capt Traoré seized power with a pledge to improve security in a nation living in fear of the militants. His coup - the second in Burkina Faso in less than nine months - is the latest sign of the epidemic of coups that UN chief António Guterres raised concern about in 2021."My appeal, obviously, is for - especially the big powers - to come together for the unity of the Security Council in order to make sure that there is effective deterrence in relation to this epidemic of coup d'états," Mr Guterres said at the time. But with global powers focused either on domestic crises - or the war in Ukraine - they have paid little attention to the instability that has wracked countries such as Burkina Faso. If anything, Burkina Faso and some other countries have found themselves increasingly embroiled in the cold war rivalry that has been reignited by the Ukraine conflict, as Russia seeks to expands its influence in the region at the expense of France, which has retained close economic, military and cultural ties to many of its former colonies in Africa. "I know that France cannot interfere directly in our affairs," Capt Traoré said, adding: "The Americans are our partners now, [but] we can also have Russia as a partner."His comments suggest that he could follow the example of his counterpart in Mali, who has allegedly brought in the controversial Russian security group, Wagner, to replace the French in the fight against jihadists, albeit with little success, as the insurgency has worsened there too since the military staged a coup in August 2020. Capt Traoré cut his teeth fighting the jihadists in Mali. He served in a UN force there, and reportedly "showed bravery" in the face of a "complex attack" by militants in the northern Timbuktu region - famous for its centuries-old buildings -  in 2018.The following year, he participated in a military operation codenamed Otapuanu in Burkina Faso's restive east for seven months. He also served in a detachment of Markoye in the northern Sahel region and took part in several operations there."Traore is close to his men, wilful and courageous. He could not do six months without going to a detachment," an unnamed source was quoted as saying on Burkina Faso's Radio Omega.But Capt Traoré  is no decorated war general, only a captain who studied at a local military academy, joined the army in 2009 and received artillery training in Morocco.He chose a military career after completing his schooling in Burkina Faso's second city, Bobo-Dioulasso, with reports describing him as "shy and rather reserved" but also "very intelligent".Now, Capt Traoré has found himself at the centre of international glare, with some going as far as drawing parallels between him and Burkina Faso's famous revolutionary, Thomas Sankara - not surprising in a nation looking for political saviours after decades of misrule."Ibrahim Traoré has taken over the leadership of the country, like a certain Thomas Sankara, [and] like him after a military coup, captain like him, 34 years old like him. Is this a twist of fate for a Burkina in search of new landmarks?" the privately-owned Wakat Sera website asked.Are military takeovers on the rise in Africa?Why African states are buying Turkish dronesHow Russia has outflanked Ukraine in AfricaWhy France faces so much anger in West Africa</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Frances Mao"><Text>Indonesians are demanding answers after a football match between two rival clubs turned into one of the worst disasters in the sport's history.On Saturday night, thousands of fans rushed onto the pitch after their home team lost a game at Kanjuruhan stadium in Malang, East Java. Police responded by firing tear gas.In the panic to escape, people were trampled and crushed at the exits. At least 125 - including dozens of children, one as young as three - were killed, the authorities say.Some fans died in the arms of the players they had come to cheer on just hours earlier, the coach of home team Arema FC revealed."I can only mention a terrifying scenario," Sergio Silva, a Portuguese star for the side said. "Police cars on fire, everything broken, corridors with blood, people's shoes."People were desperate, they had seen people die and were trying to escape," he told Portuguese sports newspaper, A Bola.Authorities on Monday launched an investigation - following allegations of heavy-handed policing. Public anger has escalated - with mourners chanting "murderers" at officials. At least 18 police officers are being investigated for their action on field.So how did this all unfold? Here's what we know so far.There had been concerns in the lead-up to the game - between Arema FC and long-time rivals, Persebaya Surabaya, another East Java-based team - as violence between fans was not unprecedented. So extra precautions were put in place - including more security "for preventive measures", Maike Ira Puspita, deputy secretary-general of the Indonesian Football Association, told the BBC.They also banned visiting Persebaya fans from coming to the match, meaning it was just a home crowd - an over-capacity attendance of 42,000 people - who roared on their team on Saturday night.The FA also deployed extra police. And during the game's first half, all was "manageable". "The security happening like usual," says Ms Puspita. "Half-time was ok."Eyewitnesses have disputed this, telling the BBC there was scuffles at half time with tensions building throughout the second half.When the game ended, Arema had lost 3-2. "And this is the point when some of the supporters ran onto the pitch. And it all just started to break out from there," Ms Puspita said.It is unclear - and in fierce contention - what exactly happened next. Authorities are unwilling to even specify a chronology of what happened on the field."I think it's better for all of us to wait for the investigation team," Ms Puspita told the BBC.But what is known is that after the final whistle blew, Arema fans moved onto the pitch, where the team's footballers were gathered in the middle. Police had already escorted Persebaya to their changing rooms, the BBC's Indonesian service reported.Sergio Silva said many of those streaming onto the field had appeared to come to "show support, not attack". But recognising the situation was escalating, the team returned to the changing rooms.At some point, police began to fire tear gas into the thousands-strong crowd, volleys aimed at dispersing them. One eyewitness told the BBC that police fired tear gas rounds "continuously and fast".Witnesses say police were unnecessarily brutal - and that along with the clouds of stinging gas, officers were beating fans with batons.The gas had an overwhelming effect - sparking a mass exodus. Fans fled down the field, heading towards the stadium's narrow exits. But with a crowd of thousands beating at each others' backs, and with many still suffering gas inhalation, it became a crush at the gates.In the scrabble to get out, people punched and clawed holes in the wall to try and pull themselves free. The weight of people pushing against the iron gates left them bent outwards. In other places, the crush left some people dying by the changing rooms.Huddled in the locker rooms, Silva said he and his teammates spent what felt like hours barricading themselves. They heard the roar of the crowd, the screams of distress in the corridors."People were desperate, they had seen people die and were trying to escape. We ended up letting in some of these people," he said.It was, he said, a scenario more reminiscent "of destruction, of war... nothing to do with football". "Fans died in the arms of players," Javier Roca, the Arema coach, told Spanish broadcaster Cadena Ser. "I'm mentally shattered. I feel a heavy burden, even a heavy responsibility." He added: "I think the police overstepped their mark."The exact death toll is yet to be confirmed. Many fans are undergoing treatment, and some of those injured are reported have suffered brain injuries.Police have characterised what happened as a riot in which two officers also died. They've accused fans of attacking officers and damaging cars - the burnt-out wreckage of vehicles can be seen in photographs. But anger against officials is rising: at vigils across the nation, protests have broken out calling for police to be held accountable. In the capital Jakarta, mourners chanted "Murderer! Murderer!" and taped signs reading "Kanjuruhan Massacre" to fences.In Malang, anti-police messages have been graffitied on the Kanjuruhan stadium.On Monday, Mohammad Mahfud Mahmodin, Indonesia's minister for political, legal and security affairs, said the government was asking police to "reveal the perpetrators involved in the crime".He said a soldier had been seen in footage carrying out an unauthorised act, without specifying what it was.Separately, the police have announced an investigation into 18 officers who were "holding the throwing weapons".Indonesia is known for violent flare-ups between rival football supporters. The country's police force also has a record of brutality - and has been criticised for frequently using tear gas, despite it being banned by Fifa, world football's governing body, as a crowd control measure."In many riots in football stadiums, police are accustomed to using tear gas - this is an abnormality that has been normalised," said Fajar Junaedi, a lecturer and football researcher at the Universitas Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta.He noted a case in 2012, where a supporter died from being tear-gassed by police and there was no follow-up investigation.Ms Puspita had earlier declined to answer the BBC's question on whether the police use of tear gas was a standard accepted procedure in the Liga.She stressed the actions organisers had taken earlier in the year to help teams manage crowds, including security workshops for first league clubs and coordination with police."At this point, it is unfair to point fingers. This is something that's a black day for all of us - a tragic and devastating incident," she said.Additional reporting by Raja Lumbanrau off BBC Indonesian</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Katy Watson"><Text>When the results came through on Sunday evening, there were cheers for Lula - as well as tears - but the atmosphere felt more like a sense of relief than outright celebration. This wasn't the first-round victory that his supporters had wished for. The polls released a day before the elections had predicted a 14 percentage point gap between Lula and Bolsonaro. They had hoped Lula could avoid a run-off but they vastly underestimated the support for the right-wing leader."I've never won an election in the first round, it's like destiny wants me to work a bit more," Lula said, trying to reassure people of his chances. "We are going to win the elections again, it's just a question of time."Lula is still the front-runner and his position is still strong. But there is no doubt this has been a blow to the Lula campaign. In the past few weeks, there had been a concerted effort by his supporters to try and encourage wavering voters to choose Lula, to end the Bolsonaro presidency promptly.Lula and Bolsonaro to face run-off in BrazilWhy Brazil's election matters so much to the US'Our candidate isn't perfect, but he beats the alternative'The show of strength from the right - not just from Bolsonaro but prominent Bolsonaristas who were also elected to congress and as state governors - has taken people by surprise."Bolsonarism is much more alive and has a further reach than people had thought and polls had captured," says Esther Solano, a political scientist and Bolsonaro expert."What we underestimated was the network of regional Bolsonarism. We have to rethink how we are failing to measure the true reach of Bolsonarism in daily life across Brazil."In his post-results speech, Bolsonaro adopted a more humble tone than in the past - a break from his often fiery politics about the left. Perhaps a conscious effort to win over those who are still undecided."I know there's a desire to change from people but there are certain changes that can be for the worse," he said. "We tried to show that during the campaign but clearly that didn't get through to the most important layers of society."Bolsonaro vowed to show people how to ensure Brazil wouldn't become Venezuela - it's a common comparison that the far-right makes when criticising the left.In the run-up to this vote, Bolsonaro repeatedly said that the polls were a lie - and to many it looked like he was just a bad loser. But reflecting on Sunday's results, there are people who think that Bolsonaro has a point. It's certainly what Bolsonaro's supporters believe."It's time for liberty, for justice," says teacher Selma Cardoso who said the polls were biased. If Lula wins she's prepared to take action. "We'll go to the streets saying people are making a mistake. It's time to change - but peacefully."But others who support the president threaten to take a more violent approach."There's going to be beautiful blood spilled in this city," Alessandro Ferreira Soares, a parachutist, told me if Lula takes the presidency. "I'm prepared to kill all the socialists and communists in the world."It's these ominous threats that make people worried. These next four weeks are going to be intense - and personal. With two powerful political foes now going head-to-head, the campaign steps up several notches.There's everything to play for in this presidential race - and everything to lose if you're on the wrong side. We saw political violence in the run-up to the first round and there's real fear there will be more of that ahead of the run-off.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Hugh Schofield"><Text>If France wants to lead Europe to a new era of military self-reliance, how come its contribution to the war effort in Ukraine is so small?That is the awkward question being posed by some of the country's top strategic thinkers, who are pushing President Emmanuel Macron to make an urgent decision on more arms to Kyiv.Recent analysis conducted on the ground in Poland and Ukraine shows that the French share of foreign arms deliveries is less than 2%, way behind the US on 49%, but also behind Poland (22%) and Germany (9%)."I was concerned about the reliability of the statistics which showed France low on the list of contributing countries," says François Heisbourg, who is perhaps France's most influential defence analyst."So I went out to the main distribution hub in Poland to see how much in tonnage was actually being delivered, rather than just promised."Unfortunately the figures bore out my fears. France is way down the list - in ninth position."The official reaction to this in Paris is: "Yes, but..." Yes, the aid statistics are unflattering, but there are other factors at work.First, defence officials say the true measure of military help is quality not quantity. Some countries are delivering masses of outdated equipment. France has given 18 Caesar self-propelled artillery units, which are now celebrated along the Ukrainian front-line.France, they add, is like other Western countries in having run down military stocks as part of the post-Cold War peace dividend.Ukraine's Caesars are fully one quarter of France's entire mobile artillery. It cannot offer much more without making itself vulnerable in regions where it is already committed, like the Sahel and the Indo-Pacific."It might look like we are behind other countries, but France has every intention of playing its part," says Gen Jérome Pellistrandi, editor of the National Defence Review.These arguments are not without merit, says Mr Heisbourg. The problem is that by not being more present in theatre, France risks writing itself out of the plot."When I was in Kyiv, everyone was very polite. I had no sense that the Ukrainians disapproved of us," he says. "In a way it was worse. I had the distinct feeling we were becoming irrelevant."For Mr Heisbourg the equation is simple. Ukraine will talk to countries who it knows are likely to deliver the weapons it needs. France at the moment is not one of them.But there is another danger for France. Its relative absence in Ukraine undermines its bid for leadership in the cause of European defence.Already many countries of eastern Europe are wary of President Macron, who they believe was far too indulgent towards Russia's Vladimir Putin in the first months of the war. A narrative has taken root according to which France still feels ambivalent about an outright Ukrainian triumph.For Pierre Haroche, who lectures on international security at Queen Mary University of London, this narrative is unfair - and is not the reason for France's low levels of arms deliveries to Ukraine.However, he is firmly of the view that France should beef up its contribution as early as possible, in order to reassure eastern European countries like Poland that "we are all on the same page". "France's goal of strategic autonomy for Europe is focused primarily on building up our defence industries via joint procurement. But if you want joint procurement, you have to demonstrate to other countries that you have the same vision about our common security," he says."In order to make our objective of European co-operation viable, we need to show eastern European countries that co-operating with France and buying the idea of strategic autonomy is not a strategic risk."Dr Haroche is calling for France to send 50 Leclerc main battle tanks. Mr Heisbourg would prefer air defence systems, which he says Ukraine is more in need of."It is like a fire extinguisher," says Dr Haroche. "If there is a fire in a neighbour's house it is better to offer your extinguisher straightaway, and not wait till the fire reaches your own home."It's not just generosity. It's also for your own protection." </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Navin Singh Khadka"><Text>Renowned US ski mountaineer Hilaree Nelson, who died in the Himalayas a week ago, was cremated on Sunday in a Buddhist ceremony in Nepal's capital Kathmandu. Fellow climbers have been telling the BBC how she was an inspirational figure to a generation of women.In 2012 Hilaree Nelson became the first woman to climb Everest (8,849m; 29,032 feet) and its neighbour, Lhotse (8,516m), within 24 hours. Six years later she was back on Lhotse, and she and her partner, Jim Morrison, became the first to ski down the mountain.On Monday 26 September, the couple were skiing down another Himalayan mountain, Manaslu (8,163m), when they triggered an avalanche that swept Hilaree Nelson over a cliff to her death, at the age of 49.Many of those paying tribute to her have noted that she was the equal of any male climber."She was doing things with top male mountain athletes, side by side," said Dave Watson, an international mountain guide who was on Mt Manaslu with Nelson and Morrison, before the couple left to climb to the summit."Her efforts were erasing the label of 'first male'/ 'first female' - it was 'first person'."She was a ground-breaking mountain sports athlete, and she did it with grace and a big smile. Hilaree's influence cannot be overstated."The 36-year-old Swedish climber and adventure athlete, Maria Granberg, who attended Hilaree Nelson's funeral, described her as a trailblazer and a "curious, committed, rare and resilient spirit" who was a role model for younger women."She led expeditions reaching out a hand to the younger generation to follow, showing the ropes, and our future selves got the memo of how to show up as an athlete and human being."In the most human way, she paved the way and shed a light on everything that we as female athletes aspire to become, by creating a life and career coloured by grace, grit and wild aspirations."Another younger climber, Melissa Arnot Reid - the first American woman to climb Everest without supplemental oxygen - met Hilaree Nelson on Everest 10 years ago, on the expedition when Nelson achieved the double of Everest and Lhotse in 24 hours. "She was so strong, so driven but had such willingness to be vulnerable," she told the BBC."As a female in this industry, it's so difficult to be vulnerable without seeming weak, but she did that perfectly and in doing so, showed me what was possible."Her mountain skills and fitness and drive were incredible, but I'm certain she will mostly be remembered for remaining exceptionally human while doing superhuman things."Hilaree Nelson carried out more than 40 expeditions in 16 countries, from the high Himalayas to one of the most remote mountains in Myanmar, and also Antarctica, where in 2020 she climbed the continent's two highest peaks - and skied down both.Billi Bierling, who heads the Himalayan database - keeping records of all expeditions on the Nepalese Himalayas - met Ms Nelson after her record-breaking ski descent from Lhotse in 2018."It was amazing to meet her, she was a great ski mountaineer," she says."The whole mountaineering scene is still very much in male hands. You do have some amazing women climbers, but Hilaree was an extreme skier too, while mountain skiing is also mainly male-dominated."Dave Watson, who was on Manaslu with Hilaree Nelson and Jim Morrison before they left for the summit, says he decided to stay put at camp three, because there were strong winds and a risk of avalanches. In fact, on the same day that the couple reached the summit there was another avalanche that killed one Sherpa and injured more than a dozen other climbers.Jim Morrison got down safely, though, after seeing Hilaree Nelson swept away, and was one of those who found her body on Wednesday.The outpouring of grief seen among the mountaineering community is a sign of how badly it has been rocked by her death, Ms Bierling says."She was a loving and a committed mother of two beautiful children."But by the same token, she fulfilled her dreams and she was beautiful and always very humble."</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Orla Guerin"><Text>As Russia's Vladimir Putin announces the annexation of swathes of sovereign Ukrainian territory, issues nuclear threats and mobilises hundreds of thousands of reservists, the response from Ukrainian forces on the eastern front is unchanged - they will fight for every last inch of soil.We travel to front-line positions in the city of Bakhmut in Donetsk - one of the four regions which President Putin is now illegally claiming as his own. Our journey is made in stages.We slow down to cross the Bakhmutovka river, speed up to cover exposed ground, then weave through a dangerous curtain of downed power lines. For the last few metres, we run. All the while, the shelling is constant - part of war's familiar soundscape.But when we reach the front-line troops, inside a battle-scarred building, we hear something else - the crackle of small arms fire. The two sides are so close they can target each other with rifles.The Russians are around 400 metres (437 yards) in front of us, and trying hard to close in. We are warned there is a Russian sniper to the rear. At his post below ground, where a ginger cat keeps him company, the unit commander is sombre and blunt. "It's pretty hard here now," says Oleksandr, a 31-year-old. "It's stressful. Everyone is under pressure. The enemy is very near, but we are standing and fighting back."He dismisses President Putin's recent referendums as "delusional" and says Ukrainians will not be dictated to at the barrel of a Russian gun. "In my view, those referendums will change nothing. We will fight Putin's army and make them withdraw from our land," he says. Oleksandr knows the cost of war - and not only from fighting his own battles."My brother died," he tells me, adding: "But I don't know where and when that happened, because he was drafted by a different drafting office from a different region. He died as well as a few of my comrades, officers who trained with me. I found out they were dead, too. So, I have lost family and friends."He has not lost his will to fight. Neither has 25-year-old Roman, who is operating a key weapon in this war - a drone.Roman is upstairs in a bombed-out room, littered with debris and broken glass, where two more cats are in residence. The screensaver on his phone is a picture of his five-month-old son Kyrylo, born since the war broke out. He has seen his only child once. "I see him in pictures and video, not in real life," he says. "It's hard, but it's also hard to imagine what the Russians could do to my family if they reach them. "I don't want them to do what they did in Bucha. I lived in Kyiv, and I understand clearly how the women feel. If we are weak, they will come for our families."There is concern here about the mobilisation in Russia. In the coming months the Kremlin will be sending many more soldiers into battle.It is unclear how well-trained or well-equipped they will be, but the Ukrainians are worried about the quantity, not the quality. They are already outnumbered. In the battle for Bakhmut they have faced a seemingly endless supply of Russian fighters. In August there were five waves in a row, according to Iryna, an army spokeswoman."They just go, and they don't stop. They don't react to firing or shelling. Some of the prisoners of war we captured were from Wagner [a Russian mercenary group]. They had better weapons," Iryna says. Troops here believe the Russians are pushing hard for victory in Bakhmut because of their recent humiliating defeats in the north-east and the south, where Ukraine reclaimed about 6,000 sq km (2,317 sq miles) of territory.For now, Bakhmut is stuck in President Putin's throat. It is an obstacle in his bid to swallow all of a mineral rich area known as Donbas - comprised of Donestk and Luhansk.  Having failed to fully capture Donbas, he has annexed both regions.As he tries to conquer Bakhmut - once home to about 70,000 people - the city has been bled of life.Downtown we see a large apartment block with the centre gouged out by an airstrike three months ago. Many of the windows are boarded up. It looks abandoned, but my colleague hears a woman's cry inside the building.We call out, and Lyudmila appears from behind the plastic sheeting that covers her window on the second floor. At first, it is difficult to hear her over the deep rumble of rocket fire."It's very hard," she shouts. "They bombard us. Yesterday a man was killed in the backyard [by shelling]. There's almost no-one left in the building. "Everything is leaking. There is water everywhere. All the walls are cracked. It is very difficult. But at least we get humanitarian aid. Every three days, they bring bread."The white-haired pensioner is living in the shattered building with her husband and a handful of others. "We can't go anywhere," she tells us. "We have no money, and I am in a wheelchair." A neighbour tells us the building has been hit five times. Lyudmila was in her kitchen when the missile struck on 1 July. "It came, out of the blue," she says. "God himself saved me."But can this city be saved?For now, the frontline is holding. Ukrainian forces are blocking the Russian advance. But here even the dead are not safe.There is an old cemetery on the city's green outskirts, in the path of incoming shells. Mounds of dark soil top the fresh graves - those killed in recent months, since the city became a battleground.As a coffin is lowered into the ground - watched by a few mourners - the silence is broken by shelling. The first launch is outgoing, but moments later an incoming round lands in the hills opposite the graveyard. Then a second strike, closer still. It is time to leave.As we race towards the edge of Bakhmut there is an explosion on the road right in front of us, between 100 to 200 metres ahead. We manage a sharp left turn and follow another route out.Many battles are still raging in Ukraine. President Putin is doubling down - and winter is coming.This is a dangerous new phase in Europe's newest war.When asked how long she thought the conflict would last, the army spokeswoman replied: "A long, long time."</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Bernd Debusmann Jr and Alexandra Ostasiewicz"><Text>For Renee Smith and her paralysed, cancer-stricken husband Christopher, evacuation was not an option when Hurricane Ian came violently bearing down on their Florida home. "It would have taken an ambulance, a stretcher, and three grown men to move him," she said of Christopher, who became paralysed just days before the hurricane as a result of prostate cancer spreading to his spine. "I had no control and it was terrifying."Without any other choices, Mrs Smith resorted to desperate measures to protect her husband. She used cable ties and gaffer tape to attach a tarpaulin to his hospital bed in a bid to keep him dry and used his wheelchair to barricade the front door from the 150mph (241km/h) winds. Even that, she feared, may have not been enough. "I'm his caretaker, so I stayed," she told the BBC from her home in Punta Gorda - one of the Gulf Coast communities hardest hit by the category four storm. "I put a life preserver around his neck, kissed him and told him I loved him."In Mrs Smith's case, the danger primarily came from the hurricane's ferocious winds. Many others were hit by a powerful storm surge. Suzie Mack, a Fort Myers resident, told the BBC that her brother's mobile home park saw water as high as 8ft during the storm. "They got on their air mattresses inside their house, because it was too late to leave, and by the time the surge got to its peak, they had about a foot of air left in their homes," she said. "Nobody died there, but it was a horrific story to hear." Not everyone was so lucky. So far, Florida officials have confirmed 44 deaths from the hurricane across the state - most of these in Lee County - with US networks reporting even higher tolls. Hurricane Ian - Maps and images showing destructionIn Pictures: Floridians take in Hurricane Ian's impactIn Ian's wake, some Florida residents have come under criticism for failing to heed repeated warnings and calls to evacuate. But for families like the Smiths and hundreds of thousands of others, logistical and financial hurdles to evacuation meant that staying was the only option. Others were simply trapped by bad luck.A woman who identified herself as Melodye, for example, fled from her home in the Tampa Bay area to Fort Myers. By the time it was clear that Ian's track had shifted south, it was too late for her to leave. "My area turned out to be safe, never got hit," she told the BBC at a mobile home park near Fort Myers. "I came down here and experienced the worst thing I've ever experienced in my whole life.""If there is another, I'm going to Chicago," she added. While for the moment the scale of Ian's destruction remains unclear, independent experts have warned that the economic impact is likely to be well into the tens of billions of dollars. Consultancy firm Milliman estimated that only 18% of people in areas under evacuation order had flood insurance, putting many residents in difficult or impossible financial situations as they seek to rebuild their homes or recover their losses. Governor Ron DeSantis - who called Ian a "500-year flood event" - said that the storm may well have "changed the character of our state".In these conditions, many Florida residents have been left wondering what their future looks like - and whether to stay in the state or to leave.  Tom, a 48-year-old resident of the town of Port Charlotte, 38 miles (61km) from Fort Myers, told the BBC that he decided to leave the morning after the storm along with his 66-year-old mother, Kathy. While the pair had already planned a move to Colorado, the hurricane prompted them to pack up and leave the morning after Ian passed. "The town is destroyed," Kathy said. So was her home for the last six years.For residents of the Sun Seekers mobile home park in North Fort Myers - many of them transplants from other parts of the US - the government may make the decision to relocate for them by declaring the property "uninhabitable". Cindy Brackett, a resident of the mobile home park, said that the prospect of being forced from her home was an additional and unwelcome trauma, just days after the violent hurricane. "With my arthritis, I can't do anything. I can't even walk out of my home. I feel so useless," Ms Brackett said. She doesn't want to leave and isn't sure where she would go if she had to.Federal officials and the American Red Cross say that about 10,000 displaced people are currently in shelters - not including people who may have taken shelter with friends, family or left the area entirely. State and federal officials have promised millions of dollars in relief funds, but many people on the ground remain sceptical of how - and whether - it will reach them. For those able - and willing - to stay, the effort to rebuild has already begun. Across damaged parts of western Florida, the BBC saw people beginning to clear debris from their homes and businesses, sweeping away palm fronds and parts of shattered houses. In some places, people were working to clear cars that had been overturned or crushed by felled trees, or boats that had been left sitting useless and far from the water."People around here are devastated," said Cal Bruno, the owner of a Fort Myers restaurant that gave away thousands of pasta meals to residents for free after the storm. "But we'll come together." Among those vowing to stay to help with the effort is construction worker Alejandro Carrera, an Argentine immigrant and 14-year resident of Fort Myers. "We will rebuild," he told the BBC, standing just feet from a shattered local marina. "I work in construction. I'm going to have a ton of work."Phoebe Gavin, a Washington-DC based native of Sanibel Island - whose aging parents fled across a causeway to nearby Fort Myer just ahead of the storm - said that she's "pessimistic" about the island's immediate reconstruction. Sanibel - which is located just off the coast and has a population of about 6,000 - was among the hardest-hit communities during the hurricane.Parts of the causeway connecting the barrier island to Florida were destroyed during the storm, severing access from the rest of the state. "I can't see it as a top priority as far as rebuilding," she said. "It would be shocking to me if we saw previous levels of road traffic within the next year."  A lack of connectivity to the mainland, she said, would be devastating to a community which survives largely on tourism. The alternative to a working causeway - a ferry - could potentially drive tourists away. "A lot of people would choose a much easier option," she said. Just across the shattered causeway in Fort Myers, pensioner Lucia Kim said that while she is confident that local communities will get back to normal sooner than later, she fears that some of the "spirit" of the area might be lost. "There is an atmosphere here," said Ms Kim, who moved from New York a decade ago attracted by the freedom and sense of community. "Just look at the 1960s architecture as well," she added, gesturing at art deco buildings in the distance. "Who knows what comes next?" After Hurricane Ian passed, Renee Smith cautiously emerged from her home to survey the damage.What she found wasn't encouraging. Her driveway remains covered in debris and detritus from nearby buildings, including some items she immediately recognised as having been ripped from a four-storey hotel blocks away. To make matters worse, Mrs Smith's front door won't shut, her chimney has collapsed and parts of her roof were blown away, leaving her and her bedridden husband partially exposed to the elements. Mrs Smith, however, sees things that may suggest that the damage in her devastated community could ultimately lead to a stronger and more resilient neighbourhood. Many of the buildings rebuilt after previous hurricanes - such as 2004's Hurricane Charley - managed to weather the storm better than the rest of the town. In any case, her husband's condition means that rain or shine, she'll be staying put. She has no choice.  For the moment, however, she is simply happy that mother nature has given her a reprieve. Since Hurricane Ian passed, the sun is back out while Florida's often oppressive heat has been replaced by more comfortable temperatures. "We're very fortunate," she said of the conditions after the storm. "It could have been a lot worse."Additional reporting from John Sudworth and Azadeh Moshiri</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Orla Guerin"><Text>Victory can look desolate. It does inside the eastern Ukrainian town of Lyman, retaken from the Russians at the weekend. The deserted debris-strewn streets are lined by boarded up or burnt-out buildings. Metal sheeting dangling from smashed roofs is buffeted by the wind. Few civilians venture out. We counted almost as many dogs as people - though the population was around 20,000 before the war.The handful of civilians we met seem shell-shocked by months of bombardment, and uncertain their ordeal is over.The only surge of life was a convoy of Ukrainian troops riding high on top of armoured personnel carriers, waving and cheering, as they headed out of town, along a road bordered by pine forest.They roared past evidence of the human cost of Russia's defeat.The bodies of five dead Russian soldiers lay near each other, now bloated, and contorted by death, but once somebody's husband or somebody's son. They were in full uniform, with boots still on, as if they might somehow return to the fight.  They appear to have been cut down together as they tried to flee. Nearby we saw a heap of discarded Russian uniforms, sleeping bags, and ration packs. There was an army backpack with a name written on it. We don't know what became of its owner. Two young volunteers from a Ukrainian humanitarian group were working carefully and quietly, numbering the bodies, and looking for anything that might identify them.   They were kneeling just metres away from mines scattered along the roadside, their dark green colour camouflaged by the grass and leaves. They are a lingering threat from an enemy that has been driven into retreat, or as Russia's defence ministry put it, was "withdrawn to more advantageous positions". That statement has a familiar ring to it after the domino of Russian routs last month in Kharkiv province in the north-east.Later the volunteers manoeuvred the remains into black body bags and drove them away - some of Russia's fallen soldiers finally leaving the battlefield.A new Ukrainian flag was flying atop a captured Russian T72  tank, parked by the roadside. "We are going to win," said the smiling young Ukrainian soldier clambering around the gun turret. "I feel very good, very great." What happened here isn't just a defeat for President Vladimir Putin. It's a complete humiliation. Just last Friday he announced to the world he was annexing four Ukrainian regions, including Donetsk, where Lyman is located. He proclaimed that they would be "Russian forever".A day later Ukrainian forces were inside Lyman, and his troops were running for their lives.Ukraine says as many as 5,000 Russian troops were encircled in Lyman, before the town fell. We don't know how many were killed or captured. The defence ministry in Kyiv said in a tweet that almost all the Russian troops deployed to Lyman had been "redeployed either into body bags or into captivity".The strategic town is a gateway to the neighbouring region of Luhansk, which is almost entirely in Russia's grip. Ukraine is hoping to advance further, using its victory here as a springboard.Lena and her 10-year-old Radion are hoping for peace, and for running water.  We met the mother and son heading for a well to refill a five-litre container."I think it will be peaceful," said Lena, who wore a black hat and a few layers of woollen jumpers, "It should be peaceful. Everyone has suffered enough. The hardest thing was to survive the shelling. We prayed as we stayed in the cellar. The situation is still tense but overall, I am happy."While deprived of school, Radion has learnt the lessons of war. His face is sombre, beneath his deep blue hat. "It was a bit scary in Lyman," he tells us "because there was a lot of bombing. War is very bad because people are dying. It's more peaceful in my heart now."Others here still seem lost in their trauma, like 66-year-old Nadia. She was alone on the streets, walking slowly, as if she could not recognise her surroundings."I hope for the best," she said "and that they [the Russians] won't come back here. It was very bad. Both sides were firing. We didn't understand anything. When it was quiet, we went outside to cook. Then it started again. We have all gone mad now."And she had a question for us. "Why am I being bombarded?" she beseeched us. "I didn't do anything bad. I didn't kill. I didn't steal. I don't understand why. Maybe you can tell me. We lived well, everything was good, we worked.  And in one moment it was turned upside down."In the streets around town pro-Russian slogans have been daubed on walls, kiosks and bus shelters. "CCCP" is daubed on a closed shop front - the Cyrillic letters for USSR, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.Much as President Putin may wish to resurrect the Soviet Union of his youth, the ruins of Lyman stand as testament to his failure.Ukraine now has momentum and knows it must move fast, Western weapons supplies permitting. Battle lines will harden when freezing weather comes. The window for reclaiming more territory this winter may close in a few weeks. </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Laurence Peter and Matt Murphy"><Text>Ukrainian troops have retaken more territory in regions illegally annexed by Russia, with Kyiv's forces advancing near the southern city of Kherson and consolidating gains in the east. Russian-installed officials in Kherson confirmed the advance, but said Moscow's forces were digging in.Ukrainian troops also moved towards Russian-held Luhansk in the east.Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said "there are new liberated settlements in several regions".Speaking during his nightly address, President Zelensky said "fierce fighting continues in many areas", but he did not give details. The progress of Ukraine's counterattacks have been closely guarded and reporters have largely been kept away from the front lines.But in the south, Vladimir Saldo, the Russian-installed leader in the Kherson region, admitted that Ukrainian forces had broken through near Dudchany, a town on the Dnipro river about 30km (20 miles) south of the previous front line. The river is called Dnieper by Russians."There are settlements that are occupied by Ukrainian forces," Mr Saldo said. Some Russian reports say the Ukrainians have now taken Dudchany.Russian defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said "numerically superior" Ukrainian tanks had "driven a deep wedge" south of Zolota Balka, a village that marked the previous front line on the Dnipro. He claimed the Russians had killed about 130 Ukrainian troops in that fighting.According to Mr Saldo, two Ukrainian battalions tried to reach the Kakhovka hydroelectric station, about 70km (44 miles) east of Kherson. The power station is in the port city of Nova Kakhovka. The Ukrainian advance is targeting supply lines for as many as 25,000 Russian troops on the west bank of the Dnipro, Reuters news agency reports.Meanwhile, in the east, Kyiv's troops have continued an advance that has made inroads into Luhansk, a province annexed by Moscow last week and previously under almost complete Russian control. On Saturday, Ukrainian forces recaptured the important hub town of Lyman in the east, near the Luhansk regional border. Russia's military had turned Lyman into a logistical base.A commander of Russia's proxy forces in Luhansk said Ukrainian troops had pushed a few kilometres into the region before being killed. The BBC cannot confirm these claims. And reports suggest that the Ukrainians are moving towards the Russian-held towns of Kreminna and Svatove in Luhansk, with some pro-Kremlin bloggers suggesting that Russian forces have again been ordered to retreat.Kherson and Luhansk are among four regions which Russian President Vladimir Putin has declared to be part of Russia, following so-called referendums denounced as fraudulent by Kyiv and its Western allies. Russia does not fully control any of the four regions.On Monday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov attracted ridicule online after he admitted that Russia was still deciding which areas it had "annexed", suggesting that Moscow does not know where its self-declared borders are. Mr Peskov claimed the entirety of Luhansk and Donetsk regions were part of Russia, but said the Kremlin would "continue consultations with the population regarding the borders of the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions". Kyiv has vowed to retake all the territory annexed by Russia, including Crimea, seized by Russian troops in 2014.The Russian defence ministry says reservists drafted under Mr Putin's mobilisation order last month are undergoing intensive combat training in the Russian-controlled Luhansk and Donetsk regions. The Kremlin plans to call up about 300,000 reservists - though Mr Putin did not set an upper limit.ANALYSIS: Who is winning the war in Ukraine?ON THE GROUND: What weapons are being supplied to Ukraine?READ MORE: Full coverage of the crisis</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By David Gritten"><Text>Schoolgirls in Iran have been waving their headscarves in the air and chanting against clerical authorities, in an unprecedented show of support for the protests engulfing the country.Videos verified by the BBC showed demonstrations inside schoolyards and on the streets of several cities.They echoed the wider unrest sparked by the death last month of a woman who was detained for breaking the hijab law.In Karaj, girls reportedly forced an education official out of their school.Footage posted on social media on Monday showed them shouting "shame on you" and throwing what appear to be empty water bottles at the man until he retreats through a gate.The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterIn another video from Karaj, which is just to the west of the capital Tehran, students are heard shouting: "If we don't unite, they will kill us one by one." In the southern city of Shiraz on Monday, dozens of schoolgirls blocked traffic on a main road while waving their headscarves in the air and shouting "death to the dictator" - a reference to the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the final say on all state matters.The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterFurther protests by schoolgirls were reported on Tuesday in Karaj, Tehran and the north-western cities of Saqez and Sanandaj.A number of students were also photographed standing in their classrooms with their heads uncovered. Some were raising their middle fingers - an obscene gesture - at portraits of Ayatollah Khamenei and the founder of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.Analysis by Rana Rahimpour, BBC PersianAfter almost three weeks of protests, it is clear that Iran's leadership is facing a serious challenge. Its opponents are no longer just politicians or people in their 20s. It is now facing teenagers - schoolgirls who are not scared of burning photos of the supreme leader.The protests have continued despite Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's warning on Monday that they were "riots" orchestrated by the West. Many of those taking part simply want a normal life. They might not understand politics, but they understand that they are not free to live their lives the way they want. Now, every school and university could potentially become a headquarters for the protesters. Every day at school, teenagers will be able to get together and exchange ideas about how to overthrow the regime. The question is whether and how the Islamic Republic will be able to stop them. The protests by the schoolgirls began hours after Ayatollah Khamenei, who has final say on all state matters, broke his silence on the unrest and accused the United States and Israel, Iran's arch-enemies, of orchestrating "riots".  He also gave his full backing to the security forces, which have responded to the protests with a violent crackdown.The unrest was triggered by the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish woman who fell into a coma after being detained by morality police on 13 September in Tehran for allegedly violating the law requiring women to cover their hair with a hijab, or headscarf. She died in hospital three days later.Her family has alleged that officers beat her head with a baton and banged her head against one of their vehicles. The police have denied that she was mistreated and said she suffered "sudden heart failure".The first protests took place in Kurdish-populated north-western Iran, where Ms Amini lived, and then spread rapidly across the country. Iran Human Rights, a Norway-based group, reported on Tuesday that at least 154 people had been killed by security forces so far. They include 63 protesters whom ethnic Baluch activists said had died in clashes in the south-eastern city of Zahedan on Friday.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Elsa Maishman"><Text>At least four people have been killed and dozens are missing after an avalanche struck a team of mountaineers high in the Indian Himalayas.The 34 trainees and seven instructors were practising navigation when they were hit on their descent from a peak in the northern state of Uttarakhand. Eight of the party are believed to have been rescued and the rest are trapped in a crevasse, rescuers say.Search efforts have been paused for the night because of rain and snowfall.Local media reports say the number of casualties may rise significantly. The group was made up of trainees from the nearby Nehru Institute of Mountaineering. It said they had been returning from Mount Draupadi Danda-2 (5,670m; 18,602 feet) when the avalanche struck. Authorities were alerted at around 09:30 local time on Tuesday (04:00 GMT), rescue workers said. "We have confirmation of four deaths out of the 33 people trapped. Around eight of them have already been rescued and the rest are trapped in a crevasse," Ridhim Aggarwal from the State Disaster Response Force told AFP news agency. Rescue efforts will continue as long as the weather allows, he said. Earlier, Uttarakhand police chief Ashok Kumar told Reuters news agency: "The Indian Air Force is doing an aerial recce of the mountain where this happened. It is not easy to reach the spot." Defence Minister Rajnath Singh wrote on Twitter: "Deeply anguished by the loss of precious lives due to landslide which has struck the mountaineering expedition carried out by the Nehru Mountaineering Institute in Uttarkashi."It comes a week after the body of famed US ski mountaineer Hilaree Nelson was found in the Nepali Himalayas. Ms Nelson, regarded as one of the greatest mountaineers of her generation, was reported to have fallen into a deep crevasse after reaching the summit of Mount Manaslu.On the same day she went missing, one person was killed and more than a dozen injured in an avalanche lower down on the same peak.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Hugh Schofield"><Text>Paris has become the latest French city to announce that it will not be setting up giant screens and fan zones for the approaching World Cup in Qatar.It cited human rights and environmental concerns in the host nation.Lille, Marseille, Bordeaux, Strasbourg and Reims are also boycotting the competition on ethical grounds.Pierre Rabadan, in charge of sport at Paris City Hall, said the fact the event was taking place in winter was also a factor in the city's decision.The movement began on Saturday after the Socialist mayor of Lille, Martine Aubry, declared that the Qatar World Cup was a "nonsense in terms of human rights, the environment and sport".Like other mayors - of both left and right - she blamed concerns over workers' rights in Qatar; the alleged high number of deaths among foreign labourers; and the environmental impact of the stadiums, all equipped with outdoor air conditioning.In Marseille, there had been plans for a giant screening if France made it to the final, but that has now been cancelled.The city's Socialist mayor, Benoit Payan, said the competition "had progressively turned itself into a human and environmental catastrophe, incompatible with the values which we expect sport - and especially football - to promote".It was unclear how many French cities were actually making preparations for outdoor venues where supporters could follow the progress of the French team, world champions in Russia 2018.The mayor of Angoulême in south-west France said his decision was as much financial as to do with human rights in Qatar.Why is the Qatar World Cup so controversial?FA criticised for 'delay' over Qatar statement"It seemed incongruous to us to risk this kind of expense at a time when we are trying to make economies to absorb the growing cost of energy," said Xavier Bonnefont, citing a giant screen cost of "several tens of thousands of euros"."In any case frankly in winter I don't think there would have been many people turning up. The public will be just as happy in a bar."Calls for a boycott of the World Cup, which takes place between 21 November and 18 December, have been growing in France, though they remain far from mainstream.The former international and Manchester United star Eric Cantona said he would not be watching any matches, adding: "Let's be honest, this World Cup makes no sense. It is an aberration."Government spokesman Olivier Véran said: "If we were to make the decision today, we would not give the World Cup to Qatar.  However when something was decided 10 years ago by 100 countries, it's difficult to say stop just a few weeks before it gets under way."</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By James Waterhouse in Zaporizhzhia and Yaroslav Lukov in London"><Text>At least 23 people have been killed and dozens more injured in a Russian rocket strike on a civilian convoy in south Ukraine, local officials say.A huge crater next to a row of vehicles in the city of Zaporizhzhia testifies to the violence of the attack. Windows and windscreens were smashed in.The BBC saw half a dozen bodies lying at the scene, apparently civilians. Baggage and coats strewed the tarmac. One survivor told the BBC her boss had been killed in the attack."She had two kids. I left the cafe to use the restroom when it happened. I ran back and tried to find her. The cafe was demolished, there were many bodies around. It was all so very horrifying," Viktoriia Yosypenko said.Reacting to the attack in the early hours of Friday on the outskirts of the regional capital of the Zaporizhzhia region, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia was a "state-terrorist".He said Russia launched 16 rockets on the city, and vowed to punish perpetrators for "every lost Ukrainian life".Meanwhile, a Russian-installed local official blamed Ukraine for the attack.The convoy was hit as people were preparing to travel to the Russian-occupied part of the region to pick up their relatives and also deliver humanitarian aid.Tears and despair as Russian annexation loomsNear the missile's impact crater, the BBC spoke to Kateryna Holoborod, sat on her suitcase in a state of shock. 'We arrived in a line, to join a column going towards Kherson," she said. "We got out to see what number we had in the queue. Then the first rocket hit, behind the wagons. "We dropped to the ground. Then the second one hit in the centre of the queue. There was glass everywhere, people screaming and running. I don't remember much. "It was very scary. I then got up to see what happened, help the injured. I tried to help an injured young man when the third explosion happened."The attack comes as Russian President Vladimir Putin is preparing for a signing ceremony in Moscow to annex Zaporizhzhia along with Ukraine's Donetsk, Luhansk and Kherson regions.The move follows self-styled referendums in the eastern and southern regions, which have been condemned by Ukraine and the West as a sham.Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February, and Moscow currently controls the majority of the Zaporizhzhia region, including Europe's biggest nuclear power plant there - but not the regional capital.Moscow-installed regional official Vladimir Rogov blamed "Ukrainian militants" for the Zaporizhzhia attack, Russian state-run media reported.In a separate development, one person was killed and five injured in overnight Russian strikes by Iskander missiles on the central city of Dnipro, about 70km (43 miles) north of Zaporizhzhia, local officials said.They said a transport company was targeted, and as many as 52 buses were burnt and another 98 damaged.Several high-rise buildings, offices and a shop were also hit.You may also be interested in: </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Raffi Berg"><Text>About 20 members of a Jewish sect held at a facility in Mexico after a police raid on their jungle base have fled.Footage showed men, women, and children streaming out of the site in Huixtla, in the west, on Wednesday night.They had been there since the raid last Friday when two members were arrested on suspicion of human trafficking and serious sexual offences.The sect, Lev Tahor, is known for extremist practices and imposing a strict regime on its followers.It advocates child marriage, inflicts harsh punishments even for minor transgressions and requires women and girls as young as three years old to completely cover up with robes.Local media said members of the group had been protesting against their detention since their arrival, including rioting and assaulting personnel.Video from Reuters news agency shows the detainees, dressed in gold, grey and white robes, forcing their way past two guards at a gate as one of their members holds it open.One of the guards trying to hold them back falls down and the group climb over him as they make their escape. A youth is seen turning and kicking the guard as he lies on the ground.  It is unclear where the group has gone. Associated Press said they were collected by a lorry and headed towards the border with Guatemala, while news site El Heraldo de México said they went by foot for several miles before disappearing into the night.Their compound, 11 miles (17.5km) north of Tapachula in Chiapas state, was raided by an elite police unit after a months-long investigation and surveillance operation involving Mexican and Guatemalan authorities and a private four-man team from Israel including former Mossad and domestic intelligence agents.Twenty-six members were found at the site, among them Israelis with dual citizenships including Canada, the US and Guatemala, Israel's foreign ministry said.It said a Canadian and an Israeli citizen were arrested, while two other wanted members reportedly left the compound two days before the raid and are being sought. Five more were detained for allegedly breaking immigration rules.The operation stemmed from an appeal to a former member of Israel's domestic intelligence agency, Shin Bet, by a former member of the sect, Yisrael Amir.Mr Amir fled the group's base in Guatemala in 2020, having to leave his then one-year-old son there.His son was released in the raid last week and flown back to Israel with his father.The group had lived in Guatemala since 2014, but in January members illegally crossed into Mexico, settling in the jungle. The leadership in Guatemala has been at the centre of a kidnapping case since 2018. Nine of the sect's members have been charged, four of whom have so far been convicted. Lev Tahor - Hebrew for Pure of Heart - was formed in Israel in 1988 and is thought to number up to 350 members, according to an ex-members group.It has been forced to move from country to country in recent years after coming under scrutiny from local authorities. It is currently spread between Israel, the US, North Macedonia, Morocco, Mexico and Guatemala.

Energy firms are getting much more money for their oil and gas than they were last year, partly because demand has increased as the world emerges from the pandemic and more recently because of supply concerns due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.EU ministers estimate that they can raise €140bn (£123bn) from the levies on non-gas electricity producers and suppliers that are making larger-than-usual profits from the current demand.Earlier this month, the European Commission's vice-president, Frans Timmermans, said that fossil fuel extractors will be told to give back 33% of their surplus profits for this year. "The era of cheap fossil fuels is over. And the faster we move to cheap, clean and homegrown renewables, the sooner we will be immune to Russia's energy blackmail," he said."A cap on outsize revenues will bring solidarity from energy companies with abnormally high profits towards their struggling customers," he added. Earlier this week, 15 member states, including France and Italy, asked the EU to impose a price cap on gas bills to slow the soaring costs. A decision has not yet been announced on a price cap. "There is big disappointment that in the proposal that is on the table there is nothing about gas prices," Polish climate minister Anna Moskwa said.Ms Moskwa said a maximum price for gas would be supported by the majority of European countries and "cannot be ignored". In the UK, former Chancellor Rishi Sunak introduced a similar tax to Friday's EU agreement in May, which he called the Energy Profits Levy.It was applied to profits made by companies from extracting UK oil and gas, but not those that generate electricity from sources such as nuclear or wind power. </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="BBC News, author unspecified"><Text>A suicide attack at a tuition centre in the Afghan capital Kabul has killed at least 19 people, most of them female students, police and witnesses say.Nearly 30 others were wounded at the Kaaj education centre in the Dasht-e-Barchi area in the west of the city.Students had been sitting a practice university exam when the bomber struck. No group has yet claimed the attack.Many of those in the area are minority Hazaras, who have often been targeted by Islamic State (IS) militants.Footage on local TV and shared on social media appeared to show scenes from a nearby hospital, where rows of covered bodies were laid out on the floor. Other media reportedly from the site of the private college showed rubble and upturned tables in the damaged classrooms."We didn't find her here," a woman who was looking for her sister at one of the hospitals told AFP news agency. "She was 19 years old." Some reports say the number of dead is far higher than Taliban officials have acknowledged. The attacker is reported to have shot at the guards outside the centre, entered a classroom and detonated a bomb.Eyewitnesses told the BBC that most of the victims were girls - they were seated in the front row, near the blast. A student who was wounded told AFP that there were around 600 people in the room when the attack happened. The Kaaj tuition centre is a private college which teaches both male and female students. Most girls' schools in the country have been closed since the Taliban returned to power in August last year, but some private schools are open.Hazaras, most of whom are Shia Muslims, are Afghanistan's third largest ethnic group. They have long faced persecution from the regional affiliate of Islamic State (ISKP) and the Taliban, which both adhere to Sunni Islam. The pupils too afraid to return to schoolSunnis and Shia: Islam's ancient schismThe secret girls school defying the TalibanOn Friday the Taliban's interior ministry spokesman said security teams were at the site and condemned the attack.Abdul Nafy Takor said attacking civilian targets "proves the enemy's inhuman cruelty and lack of moral standards". The attack was also strongly condemned by the United Nations and the US. "Targeting a room full of students taking exams is shameful; all students should be able to pursue an education in peace and without fear," said Karen Decker, charge d'affaires at the US mission to Afghanistan, in a tweet. The security situation in Afghanistan, which had improved after the end of fighting following the Taliban takeover, has been deteriorating in recent months, with a number of attacks on civilians but also Taliban supporters. Some have been claimed by IS, which is a bitter rival of the Taliban.Schools and hospitals have been targeted in the Dasht-e-Barchi area in a series of attacks, most of which are thought to have been the work of IS.Last year - before the Taliban returned to power - a bomb attack on a girls school in Dasht-e-Barchi killed at least 85 people, mainly students, and wounded hundreds more.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Flora Drury"><Text>A rights group has called on Fifa to ban Iran from this year's World Cup after blocking women from watching games in their own country.Open Stadiums questioned why the country was being allowed to compete while "Iranian women remain locked out of our 'Beautiful Game'" by officials.The call comes weeks after women were allowed to attend a domestic match for the first time since 1979.However, the rights group was sceptical stadiums would remain open to women."Iranian women trust neither the Islamic Republic's authorities nor the Iranian Football Federation that the Azadi stadium will remain open to them after the Fifa World Cup 2022 concludes on December 18," Open Stadiums said in an open letter to Fifa's president, Gianni Infantino.It also argues that even those who travel to Qatar to watch matches risk falling foul of Iranian authorities, with fears state spies may keep tabs on those who attend.Prohibiting women from games goes against international football rules, the letter points out, arguing Fifa should "immediately expel Iran from the World Cup 2022 in Qatar" as a result.What happens when sport and politics collide in IranIranian news sites reported speculation that women were allowed to attend the match in August after Fifa sent a letter to authorities calling on them to permit more women into stadiums. Fifa has previously told the BBC it would not "turn its eyes" away from the issue.There is no official ban on women going to sporting events in Iran, but it is rare as they are often refused entry.Prior to this, women had effectively been barred from domestic matches where men are playing due to clerical disapproval under the Shia Muslim regime. Women have attended a handful of international matches, including one in March this year, news agency Reuters reports.The rights group, which campaigns for equal access to sport in Iran, also claimed in the letter that members of the football team going to Qatar later this year had been banned from speaking out over deadly protests currently rocking the country. They were sparked by the death in custody of a young woman, Mahsa Amini, after she was detained morality police.The letter points out that the detention centre where she died is the same one "where female fans are usually brought to and tortured if we dare to try to attend a football game".Neither the Iranian football association or Fifa have responded to a request for comment from Reuters.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Christy Cooney"><Text>Comedian Trevor Noah has announced he is standing down as host of The Daily Show. Noah said he was "filled with gratitude for the journey" but that there was "another part of my life that I want to carry on exploring".The 38-year-old has hosted the satirical news and talk show since taking over from Jon Stewart in 2015. He said the timing of his departure would be announced later and that he would continue as host in the meantime. Noah began his career in his native South Africa, releasing a string of stand-up specials and hosting a late-night talk show before relocating to the US in 2011. He was still a relative unknown when he was chosen to take over the Daily Show on the Comedy Central network, but has since become an internationally-recognised star and won numerous television awards. Noah made the announcement at the end of his show on Thursday night, prompting shocked gasps from the studio audience.He thanked the show's crew and loyal fans for an "amazing seven years", adding: "It's been wild, truly wild". "I remember when we first started... so many people didn't believed in us," he said. "[Appointing me as host] was a crazy bet to make. I still think it was a crazy choice, this random African. "I just [find] myself filled with gratitude for the journey. It's been absolutely amazing. It's something that I never expected."The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterHe said that after everything that has happened during his time hosting the show - including Donald Trump's presidency and the Covid pandemic - he had decided his "time is up, but in the most beautiful way". "I've loved hosting this show, it's been one of my greatest challenges, it's been one of my greatest joys. But after seven years, I feel like it's time," he said. "I realised there's another part of my life that I want to carry on exploring. I miss learning other languages, I miss going to other countries and putting on shows. I miss just being everywhere and doing everything."I'm really grateful to a network who believed in this random comedian nobody knew on this side of the world."I never dreamed that I would be here. I sort of felt like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. I came in for a tour of what the previous show was, and then the next thing I know I was handed the keys."All I can say is thank you very much."</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By James Waterhouse"><Text>Every day, convoys of people arrive in a supermarket car park in Zaporizhzhia city, escorted in by police vehicles. They've made the hazardous trip out of Russian-occupied territory in southern Ukraine, finally reaching the relative safety of this regional capital still firmly under Ukrainian control.And yet this is one of four Ukrainian regions that Russia is formally annexing, after a five-day exercise it called a referendum and Ukraine and the West condemned as a sham.Among those handing their papers to police is Anton Osenev, who says the Russians tried to mobilise him twice to fight against his own country, around his home city of Melitopol. "We weren't home for the first attempt," he says. "On the second occasion they stayed at our house for some time". Had it not been for his pregnant wife being in the room, they would have taken him, he believes. His father is in the Ukrainian army, and if he had been seized he would have been on the opposite side."I still don't understand what's happening, we need some rest."Few here care about Moscow's declaration of annexation.  What they are afraid of is what the occupiers will do now to defend what they've taken - whether that is being forced to fight for Russia, or Moscow resorting to more lethal weapons.Last week Vladimir Putin threatened to use all resources at his disposal, even nuclear weapons.For the Kremlin, that's the very point - to create uncertainty over what comes next.As you drive south towards the front line from Zaporizhzhia city, the roads seem to empty.Fewer people walk along the roadside. A car or military vehicle occasionally speeds by. You don't go for leisurely drives around here.What you do get more of are military checkpoints. Ukrainian forces use them to control who gets through, and work out who is coming from the direction of Russian-occupied territory. After our military escort gets us through, we're met with an open, straight road.Half an hour later we arrive at the village of Komyshuvakha, a small settlement in the Ukrainian outback.A handful of damaged buildings hug a wide, straight highway. Most windows are boarded up. On this autumnal afternoon it's almost silent. If we carried on driving for 11 miles, we'd encounter a Russian checkpoint. An area Moscow now sees as its new "border" with Ukraine. Despite the region's capital staying under Ukrainian control, Russian forces control most of the Zaporizhzhia region. Today's annexation announcement is a continuation of their attempts to make their presence seem just. For those we meet in Komyshuvakha, nothing seems fair.One of them is Liubov Smyrnova. She tearfully takes us to a burnt-out shell which was once her home. It was hit by a missile in May. She's only just felt able to return. "I think that Putin's politics is to destroy us, it's a genocide of our people," she tells me, while sifting through fragments of shrapnel. "We are under constant pressure. I can't even describe it with words. Komyshuvakha is shelled almost every day."Most people are inside because strikes tend to happen in the middle of the day, we're told. For now, the sound of birdsong and the occasional bark of a dog masks what has happened to this small community. It dawns on you that it's mostly women left here. The men of Komyshuvakha are mostly fighting, or just elsewhere.Around the corner, we speak to three women outside the building they've lived in for 70 years. Their eyes moisten as the strain of life here bubbles to the surface. "Winter is coming and there's not a single window in the house," they explain, often talking over each other. "It's like we're sitting on a powder keg." So, what do they make of Russia's claim to half of the region they live in?"There should be a free and independent Ukraine," they say. "We didn't attack anyone, didn't hurt anyone, and didn't want anything. We want to live the way we did before."Behind a fire escape door in an empty kindergarten, there's activity. Through it are three women busily washing potatoes and cooking pancakes. They don't know who they're cooking for, they say, just that the Ukrainian military instructs them to. As she stirs batter in a large bowl, I ask Anzhela whether she cares that Russia now sees her village as being close to its new "border"."We don't want that," she says. "We want to live the way we lived. Everything was fine, everything was all right." She whisks with a bit more vigour. "We grew up this way. Our children grew up this way and our grandchildren too." </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Tiffanie Turnbull"><Text>Australia has said it will end mandatory Covid isolation requirements from next month.Currently anyone who tests positive to the virus must isolate for five days, but that will end from 14 October.At times nicknamed "Fortress Australia", the country has had some of the strictest restrictions in the world since the pandemic began. Australia's chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, said the "emergency phase" of its response was probably over. But Prof Kelly said the decision "does not in any way suggest that the pandemic is finished".Mandatory isolation had been one of the few restrictions remaining. Australia continues to record about 5,500 virus cases each day, official figures show. It is one of the world's most vaccinated countries.Prof Kelly said the country would see "future peaks" of the virus, but it currently had "very low" numbers of hospital admissions and aged-care outbreaks.The Australian Medical Association opposes the change, saying those who pushed for it are not "scientifically literate" and are putting lives at risk.About 15,000 people have died with the virus in Australia - fewer than many nations. The vast majority have happened this year after the country opened up. Australia had closed international borders for around two years and imposed strict limits on movement around the country.Australia revisited - a country changed by CovidIs Australia still a Covid success story? Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said most existing governments payments for people who have to miss work because of Covid would also be scrapped."It was always envisaged that these measures were emergency measures," he said.Casual workers and those in high-risk areas like aged care or health will still be able to get financial support.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Frances Mao"><Text>Women working at Australia's research camps in Antarctica have endured widespread sexual harassment, a report has found.It described evidence of uninvited touching, requests for sex, and a predatory culture which condoned pornography on walls and sexual taunts.Woman also felt they had to hide their menstruation, and ration tampons and pads because they were so limited.Officials have condemned the findings and vowed to bring on cultural change.Australia's Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek said she was "gobsmacked" by the independent review of Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) sites. It was instigated after individuals made complaints."As a minister, I take a zero-tolerance response to sexual harassment in any workplace I am responsible for," Ms Plibersek told the Australian Broadcasting Corp (ABC).Australia's Antarctic sites are located on the continent's eastern edge, and include the Casey, Davis and Mawson research stations. During the summer up to 500 expeditioners can be dispatched there, but during winter months the camps are reduced to about 15-30 key workers. Those workers - including doctors, chefs, and field officers - typically spend a year living at a station.Women in the camps felt like they couldn't escape or get immediate help due to the remote and isolated environment, said the report's author Meredith Nash, a professor at the Australian National University.They "have to work in the fields with their abusers for weeks at a time because they simply can't leave", she told the ABC, which first reported the findings on Friday."Or, because of the power dynamics, they are not in a position to make a complaint or get support immediately as they would do back home," she added.Sex harassment rife in Australia parliament - reportThe long-lasting effects of workplace sexual harassmentThe report also found a homophobic culture among the male-dominated field, and said people feared speaking out because they didn't want to be excluded from future expeditions.In such a masculine environment, women scientists felt pressure to hide their periods out of fear of male judgement, the review said.Women also had to "go through a gatekeeper to access free menstrual products" with a voucher request system, reflecting a lack of adequate support in basic camp infrastructure. AAD Director Kim Ellis said they were already putting in place the report's recommendations."I am deeply concerned by the experiences described at our workplaces where people have been sexually harassed, discriminated against and excluded," he said.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Malu Cursino"><Text>Morocco's culture ministry has accused Adidas of appropriating Moroccan culture in its new jerseys for Algeria's football team.Adidas said the design was inspired by the Mechouar Palace in Algeria.However the geometric blue, teal and yellow design is a pattern called zellige, which is common in Moroccan mosaics, the ministry's lawyer said.The neighbouring nations have a long history of tensions, as they continue to dispute Western Sahara. Lawyer Mourad Elajouti wrote on Facebook that he had issued a legal warning to Adidas, on behalf of Morocco's Ministry of Culture.In a letter to the company's chief executive Kasper Rorsted, Mr Elajouti said the new design was cultural appropriation and "an attempt to steal a form of Moroccan cultural heritage and use it outside its context".He has demanded the German sportswear brand remove the design within two weeks.Mr Elajouti added that Algeria's 2022-2023 season kit "contributes to the loss and distortion of the identity and history of these [zellige] cultural elements".The BBC has contacted Adidas for comment.Algeria and Morocco share a nearly 2,000 km (1,242 miles) border, which has been a source of tension since independence from French colonial rule.In 1963, they had the Sand War over Morocco's claim to territory in Algeria. Drugs, dates and disputes at mules' border crossingLater on, Algeria backed the Polisario Front's campaign for Western Sahara's independence from Morocco, leading to the 1975-1991 Western Sahara War.The border was then closed in 1994 for security reasons after militant Islamists bombed a hotel in the historic Moroccan city of Marrakesh.More recently, in 2021 Algeria cut diplomatic ties with its neighbour, accusing Morocco of "hostile acts".

He says "it is not likely that the Russians detonated their own pipeline. They could have simply cut-off gas to the pipeline entrance" if they wanted to stop supplies.The money Russia continues to receive for its fossil fuels is helping fund its invasion of Ukraine. The gas escaping from the pipeline near the Danish island of Bornholm has been in the pipe since the beginning of September when Moscow closed it off, saying repairs were needed to a vital artery in supplying Europe's energy needs. Ms Granholm suggested the energy relationship between Russia and Europe was being consigned to history."I think Russia has proven itself to be an unreliable energy partner," she said."No country wants to take the risk of putting a significant amount of its energy demand to Russia's supply. I think this accelerates the EU's push to become energy independent through clean energy".The war in Ukraine has had a profound impact in pushing up global energy prices. They've been the biggest contributor to soaring inflation in the UK, Eurozone and US, something which is threatening to reduce global economic growth.The increasing cost of living has made political leaders around the world re-evaluate where they get their energy from, according to Ms Granholm, who was speaking from the International Atomic Energy Agency's Ministerial Conference in Vienna."Every country is looking at the risks associated with putting too many eggs in one basket or putting too many eggs in the basket of petro-dictators and the volatility of the fossil fuels that accrue from that. Everyone is looking to how they can become energy independent."Wind, solar and nuclear energy are among the alternatives many countries are trying to increase as they also aim to meet the Paris climate change targets.However an analysis by Columbia University suggests that Russia has a 46% share of global enrichment capacity for nuclear fuel, and the International Energy Agency warned in July that China has an 80% share "in all the key manufacturing stages of solar panels".When asked how the US and others don't end up overly reliant on such alternatives Ms Granholm replied that "this move to clean energy could be part of a great peace plan" and that such a move "helps people's pocketbooks, helps the economy, and helps energy security".This year's steep increases in the price of oil and gas have benefitted the energy giants who get them to consumers. In the first half of this year the combined profit of five of the biggest western energy firms, BP, Shell, Total, Chevron and Exxon almost tripled to just over $95.2bn with much of it going to shareholders.Ms Granholm said President Biden's administration wanted to see such companies lower prices at petrol pumps "so that citizens are not hurting".Despite acknowledging that oil is traded on a free market she called on them to help, "at least the American companies as good American citizens" and warned they could face a windfall tax similar to what has been seen in the UK."We don't want that huge amount of profit to end up triggering consequences, either Congressionally or elsewhere, that will not be in their interest."We want them to be responsible and not be buying back shares instead of increasing production, production that would ultimately reduce prices because of increasing supply. We are looking at legislative tools as well as otherwise pressuring them."One other way the US could help increase the supply of oil to global markets is by lifting some of the sanctions imposed on Venezuela by President Trump.The South American country has the world's largest oil reserves but has been exporting minimal amounts of oil because of the restrictions. They were enacted because of alleged corruption and the political fallout from 2019's contested election. An increase in supplies would be likely to push down global oil prices. When asked if it was time to lift the sanctions, Ms Granholm didn't dismiss the idea, replying: "I'm not going to get ahead of the White House on that."You can watch Jennifer Granholm's interview in full on Talking Business with Aaron Heslehurst this weekend.Viewers in the UK can watch the show at 15:30 on the BBC News Channel, and afterwards on BBC iPlayer.In other countries, it will be on BBC World News on Saturday at 23:30 GMT, Sunday at 05:30 and 16:30 GMT and Monday at 16:30 GMT.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="BBC News, author unspecified"><Text>A US army major doctor and her wife, a civilian doctor, have been charged with a plot to leak information to the Russian government. Jamie Lee Henry and Anna Gabrielian are accused of planning to share confidential information about patients at a military hospital. The pair allegedly told an undercover FBI agent that they were motivated by patriotism for Russia. Representatives of the couple have not yet commented on the case.There has been no comment from Russian authorities, either. The pair were charged with conspiracy and the disclosure of identifiable health information, in an indictment filed in a court in Baltimore, Maryland which was unsealed on Thursday after their arrest. Prosecutors said the couple wanted to help the Russian government "gain insights into the medical conditions of individuals associated with the US government and military".The indictment states that Maj Henry, 39, planned to use her security clearance to gain access to private medical records from the hospital at Fort Bragg, the large military base where she worked. Dr Gabrielian, 36, is accused of planning to share information from where she worked, believed to be Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. She allegedly offered help to the Russian embassy in Washington several months ago, after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In mid-August she was approached by a person claiming to work for the Russian embassy, who was in reality an FBI agent. During the meeting, the indictment says she told the agent that "she was motivated by patriotism toward Russia to provide any assistance she could to Russia, even if it meant being fired or going to jail".She is accused of offering to bring her wife into the plot, and telling the agent that she had access to medical information at the base and insight on how the US was training the military to provide assistance to Ukraine. At another meeting later on the same day, Maj Henry allegedly told the agent that she was also committed to Russia, and considered volunteering to join the Russian army. She apparently said she had reservations about violating the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which is what the couple have been charged with. But Dr Gabrielian allegedly had no such concerns, and handed over some information later in August. The indictment suggests the couple planned to hand over the medical records in order to prove their willingness to help the Russians, and their level of access to secret information. Dr Gabrielian is also accused of telling the agent that her wife could share information about how the US military establishes army hospitals in war conditions, and previous training given by the US to the Ukrainian military. If convicted, the defendants face a maximum of five years in prison for the conspiracy, and 10 years for each count of disclosing health information. Maj Henry was the first known active-duty US Army officer to come out as transgender, after the army granted her permission to officially change her name and gender in 2015, the same year the couple were married.

The incubation period can last from two days to three weeks. Ebola can be associated with other illnesses such as malaria and typhoid.The fact that it was three weeks before the first case was detected on 20 September has caused concern.Ebola spreads between humans by direct contact with bodily fluids and contaminated environments. Funerals can be a particular risk if mourners have direct contact with the body.Most of the 31 cases identified are in Uganda's central district of Mubende, of whom six people have died.However, the death toll may be higher. The health ministry says there were 18 deaths, linked to confirmed cases, where burials took place before they could be tested.The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates the fatality rate is between 41% and 100%.Another concern is that this is the Sudan strain of Ebola, for which there is no approved vaccine, unlike the more common Zaire strain. This means there has been no vaccination of health workers, who account for six of the confirmed cases.The Zaire strain was responsible for the largest ever outbreak of Ebola, in West Africa from December 2013 to 2016. More than 11,000 people died.With more than 28,000 cases in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, scientists carried out intensive research into Ebola vaccines.Two years after that epidemic ended, the then unlicensed Ervebo vaccine, developed by Merck, was used during an outbreak of the Zaire strain in the west of the Democratic Republic of Congo. It was granted clearance by the WHO, which said it had limited infections and saved lives.A second vaccine by Johnson &amp; Johnson has since been approved for use by the European Medicines Agency. But neither of these vaccines has been tested against the Sudan strain.Nonetheless Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni said his government was exploring whether it was worth trying them.The focus is on contact tracing - finding those who have been in close proximity with patients, especially those who attended the community funerals.A 51-bed treatment facility is operational in Mubende district, the epicentre of the outbreak. A second facility is due to be set up soon.President Museveni said two mobile laboratories would be sent to Mubende by Friday, so that people would not have to travel for tests and risk spreading the virus.Medics have expressed concern about the lack of adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves and masks. They have also called for the affected region to be put under quarantine. However, President Museveni ruled out restrictions, saying: "Ebola is not spread like corona[virus]" as it is not an airborne disease.He said markets, schools and places of worship would remain open, but urged people to observe personal hygiene and avoid close contact. Ebola jumps to humans from infected animals, such as chimpanzees, fruit bats and forest antelope. Bushmeat - wild forest animals hunted for human consumption - is thought to be the natural reservoir of the virus.It then spreads between humans by direct contact with contaminated bodily fluids - blood, saliva, vomit, semen, vaginal discharge, urine, faeces and sweat.Men who have recovered from Ebola have also been found to harbour the virus in their semen for a period after recovery. To prevent infection, health professionals advise avoiding contact with cases, including stopping shaking hands, washing hands with soap and water and cleaning surfaces with chlorinated water.It is also important to isolate cases and their contacts. Countries usually set up holding centres for suspected cases and treatment centres for laboratory-confirmed cases.In eastern DR Congo, which borders Uganda, survivors of Ebola played a key role in providing care for infected patients as it has been established that they cannot be re-infected. However, medical teams must wear full PPE when attending to cases to prevent infection. Bodies, in a body bag, must be buried by those wearing proper PPE. More recent innovations have included having body bags with clear covers around the face to enable families to view the body safely before burial. </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Jessica Murphy"><Text> In recent years Canada has worked to advance reconciliation with indigenous people in the country. What does the accession of a new King of Canada mean for that process? Earlier this year, at a reception in Canada's national capital, King Charles - at the time the Prince of Wales - was asked for an apology. The request came from Assembly of First Nations National Chief RoseAnne Archibald, who told him that the Crown needs to make amends for the "assimilation and genocide" of indigenous schoolchildren at residential schools run by the Anglican Church - of which Charles is now the head - and for its role in colonisation. The three-day visit was Charles's nineteenth official tour in the country, and his last as the Prince of Wales.Charles did not apologise on the trip, though he spoke of the need to "come to terms with the darker and more difficult aspects" of history.But some are hopeful that the new King's accession will be the beginning of a more positive relationship between the Crown and indigenous peoples in Canada.Around the world, Commonwealth nations, including Canada, are grappling with what the role of the monarchy following Queen Elizabeth's death, and what her son, Charles, should do to make amends for colonialism.  In Canada, the King's accession comes amid a national conversation about reconciliation with indigenous peoples. It is a conversation that has been building for years, but came to the forefront last summer as First Nations came forward with evidence of the discovery of unmarked graves on the sites of former residential schools - government-funded institutions established in the 1800s that were part of a former policy to assimilate indigenous children.For Canada, reconciliation is multi-faceted. In addition to a royal apology, many have called on the Crown to return indigenous artefacts that were removed and taken to Britain, and to play a more active role in honouring historic treaty relationships between the monarchy and indigenous people.These treaties are constitutionally recognised agreements that define the rights and responsibilities between indigenous groups and federal and provincial governments. Treaties with the Crown date back to the 1700s, and negotiating modern treaties is seen as an important part of reconciliation. Cree writer and former treaty negotiator Darrel J McLeod argued in Canada's Globe and Mail newspaper earlier this month that Queen Elizabeth failed to use the resources available to her to make amends for things done in the Crown's name - from issuing formal apology to the repatriation of indigenous artefacts.He said he hoped the King will "have the insight and determination to accomplish what his mother wasn't able to and use whatever time that might remain for the Windsor dynasty's role in Canada to turn things around". The child graves behind Canada's national reckoningWATCH: Canada 'Sixties Scoop' - Indigenous survivors map out their storiesCanada was a monarchy even before it was a country. Over 500 years ago, both French and British monarchs presided over colonies in Canada. The connection between the Crown and indigenous peoples dates back even further, to when Europeans first set foot on the continent.To this day, symbols of treaties signed in the 1800s with the Crown can be seen on the prairies. When they were signed, 'treaty medals', which acknowledged promises made by the Crown, were handed out. "It had the Queen's image on one side, and that was given to every chief who signed the treaty," noted Doug Cuthand, a Canadian columnist and member of the Little Pine First Nation in the province of Saskatchewan. "And every chief who signs a treaty was given a Union Jack, because Canada didn't have a flag at that time."Although now it is the federal government, and not the Royal Family, that has the power to administer these agreements, the Crown still has a symbolic relationship with indigenous people. Union Jacks are still a common sight at First Nations gatherings across those provinces, signifying the importance of those agreements, said Mr Cuthand. Canada's Governor General Mary Simon is the representative of the Crown in Canada, one of 15 countries where the King continues to operate as head of state. An Inuk woman - and the first indigenous person in the role - she recalled how as a child in the far north, portraits of the Queen hung in many homes."She was revered by communities, Inuit people in the Arctic," she told the BBC's Chief International Correspondent Lyse Doucet earlier this month.But there is anger directed at the monarchy as well. In Manitoba last year, statues of Queen Victoria and Queen Elizabeth were toppled during protests over the unmarked graves at residential school sites. There is a recognition by indigenous people of the damage that colonialism did to the First Nations, said Mr Cuthand, but also of the ties forged long ago."It's a bit of a dichotomy, isn't it?" he said. "There's that sort of high-level relationship that exists, but then there was the implementation of the treaties and of the colonialism that followed."Nathan Tidridge, vice-president of the Institute for the Study of the Crown in Canada, argues that when Canada became a country in 1867, it in many ways eclipsed that original relationship between monarchy and indigenous nations, placing political power and the treaties under the control of federal governments. Entrusted by the Crown to govern, they oversaw damaging policies like residential schooling.Still, many indigenous people in Canada say King Charles has an important role in reconciliation despite being limited to a symbolic role as head of state and expected to not meddle in Canadian political affairs.  "All signs point to an engaged King who is more competent on indigenous issues" than Queen Elizabeth was, said Niigaan Sinclair, professor of indigenous studies at the University of Manitoba. "We need a monarch that's going to intervene when they see injustice taking place," he said - one that's "going to care beyond just nice words.""We need a monarch that's going to have the ear of the prime minister and say 'these are the treaties that you must adhere to because the Crown has signed onto them.'"King Charles recently reiterated to the governor general that he was committed to reconciliation, and Mr Tidridge sees the potential for work to be done through the Crown's representatives like Ms Simon and her counterparts in Canada's provinces. Although he did not apologise on his recent visit, Mr Tidridge thinks that one day the King could come to Canada for the apology requested by Chief Archibald."You don't just come for a whistle-stop tour, and then issue an apology - this takes time," he said."The Crown is this old institution that sweeps up over a millennia of history. He is someone that recognises and understands that history," Mr Tidridge said of the new King."He could do things that I think that his mother couldn't do."</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Juliana Gragnani &amp; Jake Horton"><Text>Before a vote has been cast in Brazil's forthcoming election, current President Jair Bolsonaro is sowing doubts about how secure the country's voting system is. While campaigning, he has said that the voting machines used across Brazil are open to fraud, with echoes of Donald Trump's rhetoric around the 2020 US presidential election."The system is completely vulnerable," claims President Bolsonaro, without providing evidence. Voting is done electronically, as has been the case since 1996.Each candidate has a number, and on election day voters type the number of their chosen candidate into a voting machine at polling stations across the country. The votes are then counted by the machines, and the totals are sent electronically to a central office. Votes from across the country are tallied up and a final result is announced, usually within hours of polls closing. Each machine also prints out a paper copy of the totals for each candidate. When polls close they are displayed publicly at polling sites, and each machine's votes can be compared with the total recorded by the electoral court. This year, for the first time, these paper copies will be published online on the day of the vote.President Bolsonaro has said: "We cannot have dubious elections in 2022. Public counting of votes is needed." He's been making similar claims for years. After winning the 2018 presidential election in a run-off, he claimed voting fraud robbed him of an outright victory in the first round, which he won by a 17 point margin with 46% of the vote.Subsequent studies of the 2018 election didn't find any evidence of voting irregularities. Brazilians vote electronically, so there are no paper copies of individual ballots.This has been highlighted by President Bolsonaro as a security issue, and he has called for "printable and auditable" paper ballots to safeguard the electronic system."It's impossible to audit elections in Brazil," President Bolsonaro declared in July during a meeting with ambassadors.He says it is "easy to rig" electronic voting machines by altering their source code, the internal commands within a machine's software.It's not true to say you can't audit the vote in Brazil. The machines can retrieve votes cast for an electronic recount.Such an audit took place in the 2014 presidential election, which concluded that there was no foul play."There is no reasonable proof of fraud going on in the past, at least in big audits that have been done," says Prof Marcos Simplicio, who took part in the auditing of the 2014 election.The Supreme Electoral Court, the body that oversees Brazil's election, says the system has a series of procedures in place to secure the vote.For example, a number of voting machines are selected at random to be removed from polling sites for a test vote alongside the actual vote on election day.These are checked to be working correctly by entering test votes for each of the candidates in a process witnessed by party representatives. "The vote placed in the electronic ballot box is secured by several mechanisms. The software goes through several tests, including tests with experts and outside investigators who try to break its security," says Julio Valente, the Information Technology Secretary of Brazil's electoral court.Before each election the court invites researchers and software experts to look for vulnerabilities in the voting system. This year, more than 20 experts tried to penetrate the system but failed to do so.However, over the years experts have said improvements could be made."The security of the Brazilian election system relies heavily on the system's software, which has been the main point of criticism from the academic community since the 90s," says Prof Paulo Matias, a computer security specialist at the University of São Carlos. Brazil election: 'We'll vote for Bolsonaro because he is God'Lula: Can Brazil's 'most popular president' win again?Brazil election: Why it matters so much to the USPresident Bolsonaro has also claimed votes are counted in a "secret room" out of public view at the central electoral office. The votes are counted by computers that are located in a secure room but party representatives can monitor the process."The view of most of the technical community is that fraud is really hard in the current system. The system can be improved and should be, but that doesn't mean there's been fraud," says Prof Simplicio.Allegations that the system is unreliable have spread across social media - often in groups backing the president. Just a quarter of Bolsonaro supporters say they trust the electoral system "a lot", and almost a third don't trust it "at all" according to a recent survey.Videos containing misleading information from previous elections are used to cast doubt on the system.  Two videos that were spread following the 2018 election showed voters entering Bolsonaro's number and receiving the message "null vote". However, on the election day, Brazilians don't vote only for the president. They also cast votes for other political representatives, such as senators and governors, and use unique numbers to do so. A closer look at the two videos shows that Bolsonaro's number had been pressed when the voter was asked to choose a  governor. When there is no candidate with that number, a "null vote" message is displayed. Voters can still correct the mistake and press the right number before confirming their vote.Another video allegedly showed a man pressing Bolsonaro's number and the machine showing his rival's picture instead. At the time, the electoral court debunked the video, saying it had been edited. The video didn't show the voting machine buttons and screen at the same time, which meant different images could've been stitched together.Additional reporting by Mariana SanchesRead more from Reality CheckSend us your questions</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Laura Bicker"><Text>Santiago Matela was 22 when he was dragged off the street by soldiers while playing basketball. The year was 1977, five years since President Ferdinand E Marcos had declared martial law in the Philippines -  on 21 September 1972.Mr Marcos suspended parliament and arrested opposition leaders - Mr Matela was among the tens of thousands of people detained and tortured during a decade of martial law.  Fifty years on, he is no longer afraid to speak out. But he is afraid of not being believed at a time when the truth about one of the darkest periods in Filipino history is under attack. Mr Matela endured three months of torture, including being tied naked to a block of ice. His captors demanded he admit to being a communist. He says he didn't even know what that word meant."They kept on forcing me to confess that I was leading a rally and throwing grenades. They asked me the same questions again and again and beat me. They used a yantok - a cane - and they hit my body many times," he said. "Even my genitals were assaulted by the military just to make you confess what you should not be confessing."Some 70,000 people were imprisoned, 34,000 were tortured and over 3,200 people were killed in the nine years after Mr Marcos imposed martial law, according to Amnesty International.Meanwhile, the Marcos family lived famously opulent lifestyles. Mr Marcos' wife, Imelda Marcos, amassed a huge collection of art and other luxuries, including hundreds of pairs of shoes.They deny siphoning off billions of dollars of state wealth while at the helm of what historians consider one of Asia's most notorious kleptocracies. Public anger at abuse and corruption eventually led to pro-democracy protests in 1986 and the family were forced to flee to Hawaii where they lived in exile. Ferdinand Marcos died three years later.But earlier this year, his son and namesake, Ferdinand Marcos Jr - popularly known as "Bongbong" - led an extraordinary comeback and won the presidency in a landslide victory.What a Marcos revival means for the PhilippinesWhy the Marcos family is so infamous'Politicians hire me to spread fake stories'The Marcos rebranding is the result of a major social media operation, aimed at younger Filipinos born after martial law ended. The message seeded in snappy Facebook, YouTube and TikTok posts is that the family has been unfairly treated by the mainstream press.Mr Marcos Jr has shunned network news interviews and refused to participate in presidential debates. He has made it clear he doesn't want to discuss the past and has instead focused on a promise to unite the nation and help it recover from the crippling effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.This popular message, by a recognisable celebrity name, hit home with voters eager for change - including Mr Matela's children. Mr Matela tells me that his son believes the past should stay in the past, a view that he finds upsetting. "My son is adamantly on their side. He doesn't know that what I'm doing is all for them. These are my experiences and what I'm fighting for is for their sake too, so that they will know what happened. "You want me to just disregard what I went through? That cannot happen. The sufferings I went through are embedded in my mind," he said. "I'm still fighting because of my pain."The Marcos administration insists it has not engaged in disinformation. Gemma, a fact checker from the news website Rappler founded by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Maria Ressa, says the disinformation being propagated is difficult to quantify."It's not one single page, it's not one single account, it's not one single group. The point is that it's coming at you from various points. We've mapped tens of thousands of accounts and groups and pages. "Many look like official history pages and post content that triggers nostalgia but within that content you will find stories peddling an incorrect narrative."Among the most widely spread falsehoods are claims that no arrests were made under martial law."Many of the posts deny human rights abuses took place and claim that the only people incarcerated were rebels or criminals or troublemakers," Gemma said. The Marcos administration has not responded to the BBC's requests for an interview. Mr Marcos Jr has posted an interview on YouTube with his goddaughter where he denies that his father was a dictator.The Marcos family has never apologised, but more than 11,000 victims, including Mr Matela, have received reparations from the government.Their written accounts are logged in dozens of numbered cardboard boxes piled high in an archive at the Human Rights Violations Victims' Memorial Commission, an independent government body.In a new green room at the centre, a young team are creating their own snappy social media posts - with facts about martial law."You have to go where the young people are," says executive director Crisanto Carmelo. Fears the past is being rewritten have led to a push to preserve and digitise the detailed accounts of martial law abuse in the hope that they can be placed in a museum. One file recalls how a mother was handed back the body of her brutally tortured and murdered son. The account is too gruesome to detail here.But will Mr Marcos allow such a museum - one built to honour the victims of martial law - while he is president?"I am optimistic that he will be magnanimous in victory and serious in his intention to unify the country," Mr Carmelo said. "This is the year which marks the 50th year of the declaration of martial law which transformed our country and transformed the lives of many ordinary Filipinos. Many of them are now in their senior years, like me, so a museum is not for me, I lived through it. "A museum is for the younger generation - to say that this happened to our country and if we can come together, they can determine what type of country and system of government and rules of liberty and democracy they want for the future."Many young Filipinos are engaged. On a recent popular historical tour, young Filipinos played games to recreate the past.The idea is to help them pin down the facts and navigate away from a maze of martial law myths.The teams took selfies together - most of them had met only a few hours earlier. They planted flowers at the memorial with the names of those who died under martial law.Seventeen-year-old Hannah found the day emotional."They've lost their dreams, their lives and I wanted to recognise that. I want to go and tell my friends that in order for us to have the liberty and democracy we have today, these were people who sacrificed everything. They suffered a lot of violence and immoral wrongdoings, and they deserve to be recognised."It seems that voices from the past, however painful, are helping to keep this country's collective memory alive.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Mark Savage"><Text>When Coolio first heard the demo that became Gangsta's Paradise, he had the same reaction as the rest of us."I was like, 'Damn, I really like this song.'"The Pennsylvania-born, Compton-raised rapper was at his manager's house in 1995 to pick up a cheque, when he noticed producer Doug Rasheed messing around with the song in another room."So I went to Doug said, 'Yo! What's this?'" "He said, 'It's just a song we're working on', "And immediately I said, 'It's mine'. Just like that. "I freestyled the whole first line, then I sat down, I picked up a pen and I started to write." Released in August 1995, and boosted by a memorable video starring Michelle Pfeiffer, the song immediately ruled the airwaves. Those lurching stings, the other-worldly choir, and that soaring hook, combined with Coolio's distinctive, confessional storytelling, made it an instant classic.It was the first "serious" rap song to top the UK and US charts, opening the door for acts like 2Pac and the Notorious B.I.G, who, until that point, had been considered too abrasive for the mainstream. And its appeal has never lessened. The biggest-selling single of 1995 in America, Gangsta's Paradise has now been streamed more than one billion times on both Spotify and YouTube. "I thought it was going to be a hood record," he told The Voice in 2017. "I never thought it would crossover the way that it did - to all ages, races, genres, countries and generations."And yet... Gangsta's Paradise faced several hurdles on its way to the top. Here's how it unfolded...Pfeiffer and Snoop lead tributes to rapper Coolio 'People thought Coolio in Castlederg was a hoax'Coolio was born Artis Leon Ivey, Jr in Pennsylvania, and moved to Compton in South Central LA as a boy. Suffering from chronic asthma, he became a bookworm and excelled at school."I lived in that library, man," he told Rolling Stone, while visiting his old neighbourhood in 1995. "I read every kid's book they had in there. I even read Judy Blume."That changed when he turned 11 and his parents divorced. Seeking a way to fit in, he fell into the gangster lifestyle and adopted a menacing, street-tough persona. A few years later, he was busted for bringing a weapon into school. Before he turned 20, he had served time behind bars for larceny.Later, Coolio studied at Compton Community College and discovered rap. He took his stage name, Coolio Iglesias, from Latin heartthrob from Julio Iglesias, and released a few singles on the local scene, but drug abuse derailed his career.In his 20s he moved to San Jose to live with his father, while working as a firefighter; and later credited Christianity for helping him overcome his addiction to crack.Still enamoured with rap, he made a guest appearance on WC and the Maad Circle's 1991 debut album, Ain't a Damn Thang Changed; then joined a collective called the 40 Thevz before signing a solo deal with Tommy Boy records - the influential label that played home to De La Soul, Naughty By Nature and House Of Pain.His first album, It Takes a Thief, arrived in 1994, and was praised for its combination of funky grooves and socially-conscious lyrics. The musician's message was exemplified by the "hilarious" video for Fantastic Voyage, said Source magazine."As the Lakeside groove carries you along, Coolio piles about six milion people into the trunk of his '64 and takes them to a magical land where race, poverty, gangs and sexual orientation don't matter and everybody was cool."Hip-hop's gatekeepers were not interested in such idealism. Ivey's anti-violence, pro-acceptance stance somehow made him "soft". He earned the unwelcome nickname "Un-Coolio".But then came Gangsta's Paradise.One day, Doug Rasheed pulled out his copy of Stevie Wonder's 1976 double-album Songs In The Key Of Life and cut a sample from Pastime Paradise, a bleak and anxious track that was one of the first songs to replace an orchestra with synthesized strings.Rasheed added a crunching beat and a menacing synth bass, then took the track to singer Larry "LV" Sanders, who laid down a vocal for the chorus."I came in singing 'Pastime Paradise,' but then I changed it up to 'Gangsta's Paradise,'" he told Rolling Stone for an oral history of the song in 2015. "I did my parts, all the vocals and the chorus, and I did the choir. That whole choir that you hear was actually me - I did all the parts from soprano down to tenor to the bass."LV wanted a rapper to appear on the track, and offered it to his friend Prodeje, who declined. Then Coolio overheard it.Mesmerised, he started writing lyrics straight away. The opening lyric, which riffs on Psalm 23, came to him instantly: "As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death/I take a look at my life and realise there's not much left.""I freestyled the whole first line, then I sat down, I picked up a pen and I started to write," he told the YouTube series Hot Ones in 2016."It was divine intervention. I was an instrument and the song was the entity. It wrote itself."Coolio was 30 at the time the song was written, but the narrator is 23 and he doesn't know if he'll live to see 24. He was "raised by the street", immersed a life of crime and retribution. If anyone crosses him, they'll end up "lined in chalk". But the story never glorifies the gangster lifestyle. The narrator prays every night, aware that he's trapped. In the final verse, he accuses the system of letting him down."They say I gotta learn, but nobody's here to teach me / If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?"It's a bleak story. One that could only have been told with the perspective Coolio gained from his teenage years. And the rapper bristled when his song was lumped in with the so-called "gangster rap" scene."I'm trying to get rid of that jacket that's been put on my back - that I'm a gangsta rapper," he said in 1995. "That's not my thing."My thing is to be true to myself and try to educate and entertain kids. When I make references [to the gangster lifestyle], I'm trying to get kids' attention using language they want to hear."Then I can take them to a deeper level. I'm just trying to get a better understanding of myself and a better understanding of other people."Gangsta's Paradise was a stark departure from the feel-good funk of Coolio's first album and, at first, his record label weren't sure what to make of it. "I called my A&amp;R at Tommy Boy Records, and I played it for him. He said, 'It sounds pretty good - I think it would make a good album cut.' Those were his exact words!"Incensed, the star's manager decided to shop the song around to movie studios. It nearly ended up on the soundtrack to the Will Smith film Bad Boys, but was eventually placed in the Disney movie Dangerous Minds - the true story of a former Marine who turns around a troubled inner-city high school by teaching them poetry and Bob Dylan lyrics.A lukewarm retread of Dead Poets Society, it was allegedly testing badly with audiences until Coolio's song started getting played on MTV. The video, like the film, starred Michelle Pfeiffer, who went face-to-face with Coolio as a camera spun around them."She was real nice," Coolio told Kiss FM's Rap show at the time. "She brought her son down to the shoot with her and she was cool. We had no problems."He was less enamoured with the movie itself, though."I hate those kinds of movies where, you know, the great white hope comes into the inner-city neighbourhood and saves the little children - 'Ooh la la, hey Santa Claus!' or whatever, all those kinds of things put it in play," he told Yahoo two years ago. "Those kinds of moments happen very few and far between. It's not that many people that care about each other [in real life]."According to Rolling Stone's oral history, the producers of Dangerous Minds, Coolio was paid $100,000 (£92,000) for Gangsta's Paradise. There was only one problem: Stevie Wonder hadn't cleared the sample."When Stevie heard it, he was like, "No, no way. I'm not letting my song be used in some gangster song,'" the star recalled. Luckily, Coolio's then-wife Josefa Salinas, knew Wonder's brother. "I guess he had been trying to tap that for years," he joked in the Rolling Stone article. "She made a call to him, got a meeting with Stevie and talked him into it. His only stipulation was that I had to take the curse words out."That edit undoubtedly changed Coolio's life. A profane version of Gangsta's Paradise would never have been played on pop radio, or entered heavy rotation on MTV. When it hit number one, it opened up new possibilities for hip-hop... although, to some, it marked the end of an era."America suddenly realised it could sell non-party rap to Brit panty-waists, and that's exactly what it's done ever since," wrote music journalist Garry Mulholland in his book This Is Uncool: The 500 Greatest Singles Since Punk And Disco."In many ways, Gangsta's Paradise signalled the end of gangsta, or 'reality' rap as a cult. It lost the allure of the forbidden when you mum started singing along."Coolio was ambivalent about the song too, often lamenting how its success overshadowed his other work."It's a blessing and a curse at the same time," he said. "For people that really like Gangsta's Paradise, that's all they really want to hear."In recent years, however, the musician came to appreciate the song's legacy, and his role in hip-hop history."People would kill to take my place," he said in 2018. "I'm sure after I'm long gone from this planet, and from this dimension, people will come back and study my body of work."Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

It stressed that payment details and account passwords were not compromised.Those whose passport or licence numbers were taken - roughly 2.8 million people - are at a "quite significant" risk of identity theft and fraud, the government has since said.Optus said it was investigating the breach and had notified police, financial institutions, and government regulators. The breach appears to have originated overseas, local media reported. In an emotional apology, Optus chief executive Kelly Bayer Rosmarin called it a "sophisticated attack", saying the company has very strong cybersecurity."Obviously, I am angry that there are people out there that want to do this to our customers, and I'm disappointed that we couldn't have prevented it," she said on Friday. Early on Saturday, an internet user published data samples on an online forum and demanded a ransom of $1m (A$1.5m; £938,000) in cryptocurrency from Optus.The company had a week to pay or the other stolen data would be sold off in batches, the person said.Investigators are yet to verify the user's claims, but some experts quickly said the sample data - which contained about 100 records - appeared legitimate.Sydney-based tech reporter Jeremy Kirk contacted the purported hacker and said the person gave him a detailed explanation of how they stole the data.The user contradicted Optus's claims the breach was "sophisticated", saying they pulled the data from a freely accessible software interface."No authenticate needed… All open to internet for any one to use," they said in a message, according to Kirk.In another escalation on Tuesday, the person claiming to be the hacker released 10,000 customer records and reiterated the ransom deadline.But just hours later, the user apologised - saying it had been a "mistake" - and deleted the previously posted data sets."Too many eyes. We will not sale [sic] data to anyone," they posted. "Deepest apology to Optus for this. Hope all goes well from this."That sparked speculation about whether Optus had paid the ransom - which the company denies - or whether the user had been spooked by the police investigation.Adding to the problem, others on the forum had copied the now-deleted data sets, and continued to distribute them.It also emerged some customers' Medicare details - government identification numbers that could provide access to medical records - had also been stolen, something Optus did not previously disclose. Late on Wednesday, the company said this had affected almost 37,000 Medicare cards.  Optus has been inundated with messages from angry customers since last week. People have been warned to watch out for signs of identity theft and for opportunistic scammers, who are said to be already cashing in on the confusion. A class-action lawsuit could soon be filed against the company. "This is potentially the most serious privacy breach in Australian history, both in terms of the number of affected people and the nature of the information disclosed," said Ben Zocco from Slater and Gordon Lawyers.The government has called the breach "unprecedented" and blamed Optus, saying it "effectively left the window open" for sensitive data to be stolen.In an ABC television interview on Monday, Cyber Security Minister Clare O'Neil was asked: "You certainly don't seem to be buying the line from Optus that this was a sophisticated attack?""Well, it wasn't. So no," Ms O'Neil replied. The moment drew lots of attention online. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterMs Bayer Rosmarin told News Corp Australia on Tuesday: "We have multiple layers of protection. So it is not the case of having some sort of completely exposed APIs [software interfaces] sitting out there."I think most customers understand that we are not the villains," she said, adding Optus could not say more while the investigation was ongoing.The company has faced calls to cover the costs of replacement passport and driving licences, as people scramble to protect themselves.The breach highlights how much Australia lags behind other parts of the world on privacy and cyber issues, Ms O'Neil says."We are probably a decade behind… where we ought to be," she told the ABC.Australia probes firms over customer 'faceprints' Australia's Nine TV network hit by cyber-attackBoth sides of politics have traded blame on the issue. Opposition MPs have said the Labor government is "asleep at the wheel", but the government points out it was only elected in May after a decade of conservative rule.Ms O'Neil pointed to two areas needing urgent reform.She argues the government should be able to better penalise companies like Optus. In some countries, the company would have faced hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties but Australia's fine is capped at about $2m, she said.She also wants to expand cyber-security laws that were introduced last year to include telecommunications companies."At the time, the telecommunications sector said: "Don't worry about us - we're really good at cybersecurity. We'll do it without being regulated. I would say that this incident really calls that assertion into question."Security experts have also suggested reforming data retention laws so telecommunication companies don't have to keep sensitive information for so long. Ex-customers should also have the right to request companies delete their data, experts say.Optus says it is required to keep identity data for six years under the current rules.Other industry figures have argued consumers should be able to take companies that lose control of their information to court, instead of the industry regulator.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Katy Watson"><Text>In the second of two profiles of the leading candidates in the race to become Brazil's new president, Katy Watson asks if Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is the same person who took the world by storm 20 years ago.It is no coincidence that Lula chose the Amazon as one of his key destinations on the campaign trail. The 76-year-old's main rival in the presidential election on 2 October, far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, has been accused of destroying the rainforest. Lula knows that climate issues have soared to the top of the political agenda and in Manaus, the biggest city in the Amazon, he told reporters "the planet needs special attention from all of us"."We need to look after our forest, our fauna, our water, but most of all, we need to look after our people because they're struggling, they're in need and they need to live with dignity," he said. "We can reclaim this country, it's possible to once again walk with our heads held high."Lula chose the Museum of the Amazon to meet indigenous leaders and talk about the future of the forest. "Nobody wants to turn the Amazon into an untouchable world sanctuary," he told the audience. "What we want is to benefit from our wealth, our biodiversity." By saying that, the former president shows that he is aware of his rival's message. President Bolsonaro is at great pains to say that the rest of the world needs to stop meddling in Brazil's affairs.It is 20 years since Lula won the presidency for the first time. A former metal worker and union leader, he became a familiar face during the strikes of the 1970s, when workers called for higher wages, defying Brazil's military rulers.He came to power promising change. Helped by high commodity prices, he spent the windfalls on areas such as higher education and welfare programmes that contributed to lifting millions of Brazilians out of poverty. Described by former US President Barack Obama as "the most popular politician on Earth", Lula left office after eight years in power with an approval rating of more than 80%.Like him or hate him, he was a politician unlike any other. But in recent years, that legacy has been tainted with his party - and Lula himself - hit by corruption scandals. In 2017, he was sentenced to nine years in prison. His convictions were quashed four years later, but his brush with the law means that he is no longer just seen as the "saviour" of Brazil. Instead, many millions of Brazilians see him as a corrupt politician unfit for office.Given that split among voters, I asked him how he thought he could convince the electorate he is the right man to lead Brazil. "Deaths [like that] of Dom Phillips and Bruno Pereira can't ever happen again," he said, skirting the question with a reference to the killing in June of a British journalist and an indigenous expert in the Amazon."Brazil needs to be transformed into a civilised country, it can't fall victim to inhumane people," he added. "I am convinced that we need to change Brazil - and changing Brazil means having a government that assumes responsibility for really caring for people."Not far from the centre of Manaus, where Lula spoke, 24-year-old mother-of-three Carol Araújo lives in small community of palafitas - houses that sit on stilts over a small river.Rainy season is coming to an end and the earth below the houses here in the neighbourhood of São Jorge resembles a swamp more than a river.Rubbish is everywhere: broken bottles, old boxes and shoes. In the sweltering heat of Manaus, the stench is overpowering.  Official figures suggest an estimated 63 million people now live in poverty in Brazil, and Carol, who was born in São Jorge, is one of them. She knows nothing but hardship, but she does know who she is going to cast her ballot for. "I'm going to vote for Lula because under him, everything was easier," she says. "But I don't know if [by him] coming back things will improve." It is a risk she is prepared to take. With food and energy prices rising, she cannot make ends meet."I try and find work when it comes my way but it's hard. I have to make it work to feed my children." She says that it comes down to knowing who will help her and those like her, because "during the elections, all the politicians do is make promises".Lula more easily relies on the older generation, which can remember the good times, but he knows he will have to win over the younger generation voting for the first time. "It's a sign of the incapacity of Brazil's elite to renew itself," says Oliver Stuenkel, professor of international relations at the Getúlio Vargas Foundation in São Paulo. "Lula has been running for president since Brazil became a democracy in the late 1980s, and in that sense he is very much a key personality of Brazil's transition from autocracy to democracy. But he struggles to point to the future, he's very much a throwback."But while this is the same Lula, he will not be in charge of the same Brazil. Economic crises and more political polarisation set the country apart from what he inherited the first time.For supporter Beth Ferreira, that does not matter. "I am crazy about Lula - Brazil needs him because we are in decline," she says. "When he started in 2003, Brazil was in the same situation, it was devastated. And we think he can do the same thing - our hope never dies."</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By David Gritten"><Text>Iran's supreme leader has blamed the US and Israel for the anti-government protests sweeping the country, in his first public comments on the unrest.Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said "riots" had been "engineered" by Iran's arch-enemies and their allies, and alleged that Qurans had been burned.He also called on security forces to be ready to deal with further unrest.The protests - the biggest challenge to his rule for a decade - were sparked by the death in custody of a woman.Mahsa Amini, 22, fell into a coma hours after being detained by morality police on 13 September in Tehran for allegedly breaking the strict law requiring women to cover their hair with a hijab, or headscarf. She died three days later.Her family has alleged that officers beat her head with a baton and banged her head against one of their vehicles. The police have said there is no evidence of any mistreatment and that she suffered "sudden heart failure".Women have led the protests that began after Ms Amini's funeral, waving their headscarves in the air or setting them on fire to chants of "Woman, life, freedom" and "Death to the dictator" - a reference to Ayatollah Khamenei.The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterAddressing a graduation ceremony of police and armed forces cadets on Monday, the supreme leader said Ms Amini's death "broke our hearts"."But what is not normal is that some people, without proof or an investigation, have made the streets dangerous, burned the Quran, removed hijabs from veiled women and set fire to mosques and cars," he added, without mentioning any specific incidents. The ayatollah, who has the final say on all state matters, asserted that foreign powers had planned "rioting" because they could not tolerate Iran "attaining strength in all spheres"."I say clearly that these riots and the insecurity were engineered by America and the occupying, false Zionist regime [Israel], as well as their paid agents, with the help of some traitorous Iranians abroad."He also gave his full backing to the security forces, saying that they had faced "injustice" during the unrest.Iran Human Rights, a Norway-based group, said on Sunday that at least 133 people had been killed by security forces so far. They include 41 protesters whom ethnic Baluch activists said had died in clashes in Zahedan on Friday.State media have reported that more than 40 people have been killed, including security personnel.Ayatollah Khamenei's comments came a day after security forces violently cracked down on a protest by students at Iran's most prestigious science and engineering university, reportedly arresting dozens.The BBC's Kasra Naji says the gunfire heard around the campus of Sharif University of Technology in Tehran on Sunday night spread fear among many Iranians that authorities had decided to make an example of the students.Security forces tried to the enter the campus, but the students drove them back and closed all the entrance gates.But, our correspondent adds, a siege developed and the students who tried to leave through an adjacent car park were picked up one by one and beaten, blindfolded and taken away.In one video posted on social media, a large number of people are seen running inside a car park while being pursued by men on motorbikes. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterThe siege was lifted later in the night following the intervention of professors and a government minister. On Monday, students at the university announced that they would not go back to classes until all of their fellow students had been released from detention. The university meanwhile said it had moved classes online, citing "the need to protect students".Protests were also reported at several other universities around the country. </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Valdya Baraputri and Raja Lumbanrau in Malang, Matt Murphy in London"><Text>Football fans "died in the arms" of players during a crush at Indonesia's Kanjuruhan stadium, the home team coach has said, as the number of children killed in the tragedy rose to 32.Javier Roca said the crush at the match in Java, in which 125 people lost their lives, left him "mentally shattered". Authorities say the youngest victim of Saturday's disaster was just three. Some 18 officers are being investigated after police fired tear gas at fans who invaded the pitch when the match ended.More than 320 other people were injured as supporters were trampled on and suffocated in crushes as they fled the gas. Indonesia's deputy minister of children and women affairs said the children were aged between three and 17. An eyewitness told the BBC that police had fired numerous gas rounds "continuously and fast" after the situation with fans became "tense". Home team Arema FC supporters ran onto the pitch when the match ended in a 3-2 defeat to their rivals Persebaya Surabaya.Videos on social media show fans clambering over fences to escape. Separate videos appeared to show lifeless bodies on the floor.One witness, Chandra, told the BBC that a sea of smoke in the stands caused instant panic among spectators. "Little kids were crying, women were fainting, screams were heard everywhere, all were flocking out," he said. Another fan, Eko, said he couldn't get out of the stand's exits due to the number of people trying to escape. "I went back to the top of the stands with friends. Then I used a scarf to keep the smoke away. After that I jumped into the field and went down through the side door," he said.Ester Andayanengtyas told the BBC her 17-year-old daughter Debora suffered serious injuries, including a broken neck and swelling on the brain during the panic. "I asked her not to watch the game that day. She didn't return home, in the morning her friends were looking for her," Ms Andayanengtyas said. "We looked for her in the ER, but she wasn't there. The hospital told us to look at the mortuary. The confusion happened because my daughter didn't carry an ID." Other witnesses reported hearing parents crying out "where is my child" among the chaos, and one man told the BBC that he saw parents collapsing while protecting their children. "A mother fainted while hugging her child, next to her the boy fainted," he said. "Then some supporters picked up the mother and the boy to get out of the stadium. They were carried away unconscious - maybe because of the tear gas."Muhamad Dipo Maulana, 21, who was at the match, told BBC Indonesian that after the game had ended a few Arema fans went on the pitch to remonstrate with the home team players but were immediately intercepted by police and "beaten".More spectators then took to the pitch in protest, the supporter said."Police with dogs, shields, and soldiers came forward," Mr Dipo told the BBC. He said he had heard more than 20 tear gas shots towards spectators at the stadium.Police spokesperson Dedi Prasetyo told reporters that the officers under investigation "were responsible for holding" the weapons and said they were being questioned by an internal affairs team. A police chief has now been sacked following the investigation.He added that several other officers, including the field security team, and some officials from the Indonesian football league, were also under investigation. Indonesia's human rights commission said it will conduct its own inquiry into the disaster, and President Joko Widodo has ordered that all matches in Indonesia's top league must be stopped until the official probe has been carried out. Amnesty International said the police response amounted to "use of excessive force by the state" to control an unarmed crowd, and protesters in the capital Jakarta on Sunday night carried placards that read "stop police brutality". Indonesia's police force has been previously criticised for its frequent use of tear gas in tightly-packed stadiums.Meanwhile, Mr Roca, the Arema FC coach, told the Spanish broadcaster Cadena Ser that he thought "the police overstepped their mark" in efforts to control the crowd. The announcement of the investigation comes after world football's governing body Fifa called the disaster "a dark day for all involved in football and a tragedy beyond comprehension". Fifa's own regulations say no "crowd control gas" should be carried or used by stewards or police at matches and the body has requested a report on the incident from the Indonesian football federation. Security Minister Mahfud MD wrote on Instagram that the stadium had been filled beyond capacity, with over 42,000 tickets being sold for the game in the 38,000 capacity stadium. "It had gotten anarchic. They started attacking officers, they damaged cars," said Nico Afinta, police chief in East Java, adding that two police officers were among the dead."We would like to convey that... not all of them were anarchic. Only about 3,000 who entered the pitch," he said.Fleeing fans "went out to one point at the exit. Then there was a build-up, in the process of accumulation there was shortness of breath, lack of oxygen", the officer added.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Vanessa Buschschlüter"><Text>Brazil's election is going into a second round in which left-winger Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva will face far-right incumbent Jair Bolsonaro.With almost all the votes counted, Lula had won 48% against Bolsonaro's 43% - a much closer result than opinion polls had suggested.But Lula fell short of the more than 50% of valid votes needed to prevent a run-off. Voters now have four weeks to decide which of the two should lead Brazil.Winning outright in the first round was always going to be a tall order for any candidate - the last time it happened was 24 years ago.But President Bolsonaro and Lula had given their supporters hope that they could achieve just that.Both candidates can and will claim this as a victory, though. Lula has already said that this is a "mere delay" on his way to the presidency.For the 76-year-old former metal worker - who could not run in the 2018 election because he was in prison after being convicted on corruption charges which were later annulled - this spells a remarkable comeback.And President Bolsonaro, whom opinion polls had shown trailing far behind Lula, will rejoice in the fact that he proved the pollsters wrong, just as he had predicted he would. A race that is far from overWhy Brazil's election matters so much to the US'Our candidate isn't perfect, but he beats the alternative'This is a drama which has been years in the making. The two men are arch-rivals and spent much of the campaign trading insults.In the last TV debate before the vote, President Bolsonaro called Lula a thief, in reference to the corruption charges that put him in jail for 580 days before the conviction was annulled. Lula, who has always maintained that the charges against him were politically motivated, has labelled Mr Bolsonaro a madman.Not surprisingly, that tension has filtered down into the streets. During the nights before the vote, neighbours here in Rio could be heard shouting "Lula is a thief" and "Out with Bolsonaro" at each other.  Since the two candidates are such polar opposites, much is at stake.Lula says he will bolster measures to protect the Amazon rainforest, while Mr Bolsonaro has argued that parts of the rainforest should be opened up to economic exploitation.Deforestation and forest fires have soared during President Bolsonaro's time in office. Climate activists have warned that if he is re-elected, the area could reach a tipping point. Critics point out that Lula's environmental record during his time in office - he governed Brazil from 2003 to 2010 - was far from perfect.  But with Mr Bolsonaro counting on the agricultural sector and agribusiness for votes and support, it is Lula who is the preferred choice of climate activists. However, voters in Brazil have many other pressing concerns, such as rising food prices, which have contributed to an increase in poverty and hunger.Mr Bolsonaro acknowledged these concerns in a statement after the results were out. "I understand that a lot of the vote was down to the situation the Brazilian people are in. They are feeling the price rises, especially those of basic goods. I do understand that there's a desire for change but some change can be for the worse," he warned. Many voters also mentioned education and Brazil's high levels of inequality as issues they want the new president to tackle. Much of the campaign, however, was overshadowed by concern that Mr Bolsonaro may not accept defeat after he had said that "only God" could remove him from office. He had also cast doubts on Brazil's electronic voting system, alleging - without providing any evidence - that it was open to fraud. With the result much more favourable to him than predicted, he is now likely to concentrate more on how to sway those voters who cast their ballot for one of the other nine candidates who were eliminated in the first round.All eyes will now be on centrist Senator Simone Tebet, who came third in the election with 4%, and centre-left candidate Ciro Gomes, who came fourth with 3%. Both said that they would announce "in the coming days" who they would throw their weight behind for the run-off. Lula, who seems to thrive on overcoming obstacles, has already announced that "the fight continues until the final victory, that's our motto".</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Ben Tobias"><Text>Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov says his three sons, aged 14, 15 and 16, will soon travel to the Ukraine front line to fight with Russian forces. Kadyrov is a strong ally of Vladimir Putin, although has recently criticised Russian military leadership.On social media, he wrote that a father should teach his sons how to protect their family, people and fatherland. Russia has signed a UN treaty aimed at preventing children under the age of 18 from taking direct part in hostilities.Using children under the age of 15 to participate in hostilities is considered a war crime by the International Criminal Court. However Russia does not recognise its jurisdiction.In a long post on the Telegram messaging app, Kadyrov said his sons' military training began when they were much younger, and the time had come for them to experience a real battle. He also took aim at those "empty-worded" people who claimed the Chechen leader's loved-ones were not taking part in the military operation in Ukraine. The post was accompanied by a slickly-produced video of his sons firing various weapons at a training ground. Kadyrov has ruled the southern Russian republic since 2007, when he was named the region's president by Vladimir Putin. It has been a period of relative stability in Chechnya, which fought unsuccessfully for independence for a decade. But Kadyrov has been criticised for ruling with an iron fist, and allowing human rights violations to flourish. Kadyrov is a fierce supporter of Vladimir Putin, and Chechen forces have been fighting in Ukraine since the start of the war. However, after recent military setbacks in the Kharkiv and Donetsk regions, he criticised Russia's military leadership, describing one commander as a "mediocrity" and bemoaning a lack of basic logistics.He also called for Russia to take more drastic measures against Ukraine, including the use of a tactical nuclear weapon. The Kremlin responded that decisions like that should not be made emotionally.Kadyrov's criticism was in response to the retreat of Russian forces from the Ukrainian town of Lyman in Donetsk region - a major strategic setback for Moscow.Capturing the town is important for Ukrainian forces, because it can be used as a foothold to reach further into Russian-held parts of Ukraine. It was also being used by Russia as a logistics hub.The defeat in Lyman was also symbolic, as it happened just a day after a grand signing ceremony to annex four occupied regions of Ukraine - including Donetsk, where Lyman is situated. Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions all held so-called referendums on joining Russia last month, which were dismissed as a "sham" by Ukraine and its Western allies. On Sunday evening, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukrainian troops had also recaptured some territory in the Kherson region. Its Russian-installed head, Vladimir Saldo, described the situation there as "tense" and admitted Ukrainian forces had made breakthroughs. None of the four regions newly claimed by Russia are completely under Russian control, raising the question of how annexation will work - particularly in Ukrainian-controlled territory. The Kremlin says it will "consult" with residents of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions over where the borders should lie, suggesting that Russia may decide not to lay claim to the entire regions. In Luhansk and Donetsk the situation is different. Just before the war began Mr Putin recognised the whole of those regions as independent republics, which have now - as Moscow sees it - voted to join Russia. </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="BBC News, author unspecified"><Text>Kim Kardashian has agreed to pay a $1.26m (£1.12m) fine for advertising EthereumMax on her Instagram page.The US Securities and Exchange Commission said the reality TV star had received $250,000 for advertising the cryptocurrency, without disclosing she had been paid to do so.She also agreed not to promote crypto asset securities for three years.Her lawyer told BBC News: "Ms Kardashian is pleased to have resolved this matter with the SEC."The lawyer said: "Kardashian fully cooperated with the SEC from the very beginning and she remains willing to do whatever she can to assist the SEC in this matter. "She wanted to get this matter behind her to avoid a protracted dispute. "The agreement she reached with the SEC allows her to do that so that she can move forward with her many different business pursuits."Ms Kardashian, boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr, basketball player Paul Pierce and EthereumMax's creators were sued by investors in January.The legal action alleged they had collaborated to "misleadingly promote and sell" the cryptocurrency in a "pump and dump" scheme designed to inflate the price before selling to investors.EthereumMax disputed the allegations at the time.In spite of its name, EthereumMax has no legal or business connection with the Ethereum cryptocurrency.Anyone can create a crypto coin.All you need is a few pounds, a YouTube tutorial and a funky name.This month alone, dozens of new tokens will be launched, with creators promising their coin will be the next big thing.With little intrinsic value to the product, marketing is key - and as in many modern industries, celebrities can be the make or break. EthereumMax put a huge amount of money into snapping up celebrities such as Kim Kardashian - and at first, it seemed to be working out. But as with many crypto coins, the fall was as dramatic as the rise. Even if EthereumMax had retained the value it gained after the celebrity pump, regulators both in the US and UK were extremely uncomfortable about the marketing of the coin.The crypto industry is still largely unregulated - but Kim Kardashian joins a growing list of people and companies being punished for promoting these highly risky products.Gary Gensler, who chairs the SEC, called the case a "reminder" celebrity endorsement did not necessarily make a product worth investing in."Ms Kardashian's case also serves as a reminder to celebrities and others that the law requires them to disclose to the public when and how much they are paid to promote investing in securities," he said.Later, in a YouTube video about crypto investment, he added: "Celebrity endorsements... don't mean that an investment product is right for you or even, frankly, that it's legitimate."Even if a celebrity endorsement is genuine, each investment has its own risk and opportunities."When it comes to crypto, remember many of these are highly speculative assets. "You may be wondering if it's right for you or even if it might be a scam."</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By James Gallagher"><Text>The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine has gone to Sweden's Svante Paabo for his work on human evolution. The Prize committee said he achieved the seemingly impossible task of cracking the genetic code of one of our extinct relatives - Neanderthals.He also performed the "sensational" feat of discovering the previously unknown relative - Denisovans.His work helped explore our own evolutionary history and how humans spread around the planet. The Swedish geneticist's work gets to the heart of some of the most fundamental questions - where do we come from and what allowed us, Homo sapiens, to succeed while our relatives went extinct.He was just off to pick his daughter up from a sleepover when he got the call saying he'd won. He told the BBC: "I was very surprised and overwhelmed, I had not expected this." The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterIn the 1990s, research on working out the human genetic code was taking place at pace. But that relied on fresh samples of pristine DNA.Prof Paabo's interest was in the old, degraded and contaminated genetic material from our ancestors. Many thought it was an impossible challenge. But he was, for the first time, able to sequence DNA from a 40,000-year-old piece of bone.Those results showed that Neanderthals - who mostly lived in Europe and Western Asia - were distinct from both modern day humans and chimpanzees.His work focused on hominins - the group of modern humans that includes us, Homo sapiens, but also our extinct relatives. "By revealing genetic differences that distinguish all living humans from extinct hominins, his discoveries provide the basis for exploring what makes us uniquely human", the Nobel committee said.BBC Podcast: Svante Paabo on the difference between us and NeanderthalsFurther comparisons between Neanderthal DNA and humans from around the world showed their DNA was a closer match to humans coming from Europe or Asia. This tells us that Homo sapiens had sex and children with Neanderthals after migrating out of Africa around 70,000 years ago. And you can still see the legacy of that today. Between 1-4% of modern human DNA comes from our Neanderthal relatives and this even affects our body's ability to respond to infection.The next seismic contribution to human origins came in 2008. Scientists had found a 40,000-year-old finger bone in the Denisova cave, in Siberia.Prof Paabo was able to sequence a sample of DNA and the results showed it was a previously unknown hominin - known as Denisovans. And it turned out Homo sapiens bred with Denisovans too. In parts of South East Asia up to 6% of people's DNA is Denisovan. Some of this genetic inheritance helps the body cope with low levels of oxygen, aids survival at high altitudes and is found in present-day Tibetans. Prof Paabo only heard the news this morning when he was called by Thomas Perlmann, the secretary for the Nobel Committee for Physiology or Medicine."He was overwhelmed, he was speechless. Very happy," said Prof Perlmann.Prof Paabo is seen as one of the founders of the scientific discipline of paleogenomics. He wins the 10m Swedish kronor (£800,000) prize. He follows in the footsteps of his father, Sune Bergstrom, who won the same Nobel Prize in 1982.His work shows there were already two distinct groups of hominins (Neanderthals and Denisovans) living in Eurasia when Homo sapiens spread from Africa.Analysis suggests these now extinct populations were small and relatively inbred and may not have been able to compete with rapidly expanding modern humans.Follow James on Twitter2021 - David Julius and Ardem Patapoutian for their work on how the body senses touch and temperature. 2020 - Michael Houghton, Harvey Alter and Charles Rice for the discovery of the virus Hepatitis C.2019 - Sir Peter Ratcliffe, William Kaelin and Gregg Semenza for discovering how cells sense and adapt to oxygen levels2018 - James P Allison and Tasuku Honjo for discovering how to fight cancer using the body's immune system2017- Jeffrey Hall, Michael Rosbash and Michael Young for unravelling how bodies keep a circadian rhythm or body clock2016 - Yoshinori Ohsumi for discovering how cells remain healthy by recycling waste2015 - William C Campbell, Satoshi Ōmura and Youyou Tu for anti-parasite drug discoveries</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Jasmine Andersson"><Text>King Charles will host the first state visit of his reign next month when he welcomes the president of South Africa to Buckingham Palace.President Cyril Ramaphosa and his wife, First Lady Tshepo Motsepe, have accepted an invitation to visit the King and Queen Consort.The visit will take place from Tuesday November 22 to Thursday November 24.It is understood the trip was in the early stages of being planned before the Queen's death in September.It will be the first time a South African leader has visited the UK in an official capacity in more than a decade, with the last state visit being in 2010 when Jacob Zuma visited the late Queen.The King has visited South Africa on a number of occasions since his first tour of the country in 1997, which included stops in Pretoria, Johannesburg, Durban and Cape Town.He last travelled to the country in 2011, with the Queen Consort. It was not a state event.The Queen shared a particularly close relationship with Nelson Mandela, the first democratically elected president of South Africa. The pair were said to have enjoyed a warm friendship, and unusually, referred to each other by their first names.Mr Ramaphosa, who has been in power since 2018, is the fourth leader of South Africa since Mr Mandela. State visits are an exercise in soft power and red carpets, filled with royal ceremony and banquets, but focused on the hard-headed business of strengthening international relationships.It's the Foreign Office that advises on which countries are invited - the last being US President Donald Trump in 2019, before Covid stopped any further state visits.It's pomp with a purpose against a backdrop of pageantry, photo ops and the jangle of a royal carriage ride. Even the paintings and items on view from the Royal Collection can be changed to set the right tone.For the first time it will be King Charles who will now be the host at Buckingham Palace, proposing the toast to the South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa.Charles was a guest at the state banquet in 1996 when Nelson Mandela paid a state visit, after post-apartheid South Africa had rejoined the Commonwealth.The new King will want to build his own bridges with the Commonwealth, sending a message about supporting diversity and multiculturalism.When he arrives, Mr Ramaphosa will be given a ceremonial welcome on Horse Guards Parade, and then invited to a state banquet hosted by the monarch. He is expected to spend the rest of their trip visiting Prime Minister Liz Truss, government ministers and leaders of the main political parties. But Mr Ramaphosa's visit is clouded by allegations of money laundering.The rolling scandal, which erupted in June, has seen Mr Ramaphosa accused of covering up of a robbery that took place at his private farm in February 2020.He has repeatedly denied the allegations and insists he will stand for a second term in the 2024 national elections as ANC leader and president.

The company says it only uses sawdust and waste wood.Panorama analysed satellite images, traced logging licences and used drone filming to prove its findings. Reporter Joe Crowley also followed a truck from a Drax mill to verify it was picking up whole logs from an area of precious forest. Ecologist Michelle Connolly told Panorama the company was destroying forests that had taken thousands of years to develop."It's really a shame that British taxpayers are funding this destruction with their money. Logging natural forests and converting them into pellets to be burned for electricity, that is absolutely insane," she said.The row over the UK's largest power plantThe Drax power station in Yorkshire is a converted coal plant, which now produces 12% of the UK's renewable electricity.It has already received £6bn in green energy subsidies. Burning wood is considered green, but it is controversial among environmentalists. Panorama discovered Drax bought logging licences to cut down two areas of environmentally-important forest in British Columbia.One of the Drax forests is a square mile, including large areas that have been identified as rare, old-growth forest.The provincial government of British Columbia says old-growth forests are particularly important and that companies should put off logging them.Drax's own responsible sourcing policy says it "will avoid damage or disturbance" to primary and old-growth forest.  However, the latest satellite pictures show Drax is now cutting down the forest. The company told Panorama many of the trees there had died, and that logging would reduce the risk of wildfires. The entire area covered by the second Drax logging licence has already been cut down.  Burning wood produces more greenhouse gases than burning coal. The electricity is classed as renewable because new trees are planted to replace the old ones and these new trees should recapture the carbon emitted by burning wood pellets. But recapturing the carbon takes decades and the off-setting can only work if the pellets are made with wood from sustainable sources. Primary forests, which have never been logged before and store vast quantities of carbon, are not considered a sustainable source. It is highly unlikely that replanted trees will ever hold as much carbon as the old forest. Drax told the BBC it had not cut down the forests itself and said it transferred the logging licences to other companies. But Panorama checked and the authorities in British Columbia confirmed that Drax still holds the licences.Drax said it did not use the logs from the two sites Panorama identified. It said they were sent to timber mills - to make wood products - and that Drax only used the leftover sawdust for its pellets.The company says it does use some logs - in general - to make wood pellets. It claims it only uses ones that are small, twisted, or rotten.But documents on a Canadian forestry database show that only 11% of the logs delivered to the two Drax plants in the past year were classified as the lowest quality, which cannot be used for wood products. Panorama wanted to see if logs from primary forests cut down by logging companies were being transferred to Drax's Meadowbank pellet plant. The programme filmed a truck on a 120-mile round trip: leaving the plant, collecting piles of whole logs from a forest that had been cut down by a logging company and then returning to the plant for their delivery.Drax later admitted that it did use logs from the forest to make wood pellets. The company said they were species the timber industry did not want, and they would often be burned anyway to reduce wildfire risks. The company also said the sites identified by Panorama were not primary forest because they were near roads.

In 1973, several hundred locals, together with radical activists from the American Indian Movement (AIM), poured into the nearby village of Wounded Knee in South Dakota to protest government abuse.The protest resulted in a violent stand-off with federal agents that went on for 71 days."I went up there, like a proud Indian woman with dignity, with courage, with grace, and with humility," she remembered at the recent event."I knew that I had to speak the truth. Some people may accept it. And some people may not."Screen Actors Guild member Littlefeather struggled to get work in the industry afterwards but said it was "never too late for an apology... it's never too late for forgiveness."In a recent interview with Variety, she said she had made the Oscars speech in order to honour her ancestors and "native people everywhere"."I was met with the stereotypical tomahawk chop, individuals who called at me, and I ignored all of them," she recalled. "I continued to walk straight ahead with a couple of armed guards beside me, and I held my head high and was proud to be the first Indigenous woman in the history of the Academy Awards to make that political statement. "At that time in 1973, there was a media blackout on Wounded Knee and against the American Indian Movement that was occupying it," she went on. "Marlon had called them in advance and asked them to watch the Academy Awards, which they did."As they saw me, up on stage, refusing that Academy Award for the stereotypes within the film industry, and mentioning Wounded Knee in South Dakota, it would break the media boycott."In 2020, Littlefeather told the BBC that straight after the speech she had to leave the stage with two security guards. But, she added, it "was a very good thing" as actor John Wayne was backstage. She said he was "furious with Marlon and furious with me" and wanted to pull her off stage himself.Littlefeather featured in films like The Trial of Billy Jack, Johnny Firecloud and Counselor at Crime, but said she returned to San Francisco after being blacklisted by the industry, to continue her activism and work in health care and the theatre.Paying tribute online on Monday, Dakota/Lakota Sioux writer and biologist Ruth H. Robertson, aka Red Road Woman, pointed to Littlefeather's work with the American Indian Aids Institute of San Francisco.Lakota Man on Twitter offered: "It's with a heavy heart that I mourn the passing of Sacheen Littlefeather. I wish her a blessed journey", later adding: "Honour her".TV writer Joey Clift said: "When I talk about how our current Native storytelling movement in Hollywood is built on the shoulders of activists fighting tirelessly for decades for Native people to finally get our day in the sun, I'm talking about Sacheen Littlefeather. RIP."The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterIn announcing her death online, the Academy quoted Littlefeather, the subject of the 2021 documentary, Sacheen: Breaking the Silence, saying: "When I am gone, always be reminded that whenever you stand for your truth, you will be keeping my voice and the voices of our nations and our people alive."</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Natasha Booty"><Text>Burkina Faso's new military leader, Capt Ibrahim Traoré, has urged cabinet ministers to "move faster" to fix the country's "urgent" problems, including an insurgency by Islamist militants.The man he ousted in a coup on Friday has formally agreed to step down, religious and community leaders said.They said Capt Traoré had accepted Lt Col Paul-Henri Damiba's resignation and conditions he had set.He has gone to Togo, according to that country's government spokesman.In a recording widely shared on social media, Lt Col Damiba said he wished Burkina Faso's new leader every success. It is not known if he was alone when it was made.On Sunday Capt Traoré said the country was facing an emergency in every sector, "from security to defence, to health, to social action, to infrastructure", and it was time for government to "abandon the unnecessary red tape".He wants fast solutions to big problems, which some fear signals a turn towards Russia.Latest updates on Burkina Faso from BBC Africa LiveWhy France faces so much anger in West AfricaCoups that promised and failed to bring safetyRussia and France are engaged in a battle for influence in several former French colonies in West and Central Africa. At the weekend there were attacks on French institutions, after it was reported that Lt Col Damiba was sheltering at a French military base in the capital, Ouagadougou.France's foreign ministry said they were the work of "hostile demonstrators" who had been "manipulated by a disinformation campaign against us".Some in Ouagadougou chanted pro-Russian slogans and waved Russian flags as they greeted the new junta leader and his convoy on Sunday. He regards former colonial power France as an ally of the man he ousted, and has spoken of his willingness to work with new partners to fight Islamist insurgents - and analysts believe that could mean hiring Russian mercenaries.Russian military contractors are said to be active in neighbouring Mali, after French forces pulled out following a row with that country's military leaders. The Russians are accused by rights groups of committing abuses and massacres of civilians, which Russia has always denied.The head of the Russian mercenary Wagner group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has welcomed the takeover in Burkina Faso. Meanwhile, the Russian government said on Monday it "would like the situation in Burkina Faso to normalise as soon possible".Burkina Faso controls as little as 60% of its territory, experts say, and Islamist violence is worsening.The African Union has demanded the return of constitutional order by July 2023 at the latest, agreeing with the regional group Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) that the ousting of leader Lt Col Damiba was "unconstitutional".But Ecowas has since praised "the various parties in Burkina Faso for agreeing to a peaceful settlement of their differences", as days of power struggles came to an end without bloodshed.Lt Col Damiba formally resigned on Sunday in exchange for the new junta agreeing to respect seven conditions  - including a guarantee of his personal and family security, an agreement to continue with efforts at national reconciliation and a continued respect for the guarantee of returning to civilian rule within two years. The deposed colonel had himself ousted President Roch Kaboré in January, saying that he had failed to deal with growing militant Islamist violence.Many citizens in Burkina Faso have not felt safe for some time.The Islamist insurgency broke out in the country in 2015, leaving thousands dead and forcing an estimated two million people from their homes.This is Burkina Faso's ninth coup since independence from France in 1960.Additional reporting by Alys Davies</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Matt Murphy"><Text>Bulgaria's centre-right GERB party has won the country's parliamentary election, preliminary results show.Led by ex-Prime Minister Boyko Borissov, GERB took 25.4% of votes with 99% of ballots counted, officials said. But the 63-year-old faces a difficult task forming a working coalition, as most other parties have already ruled out working with him. Many of his opponents accuse him of overseeing government corruption during his time in office, which he denies.Mr Borissov has previously served three separate terms in Bulgaria's top job, and tackling graft became a key part of an election last November. Sunday's poll was called after the centrist government led by Kiril Petkov lost a no-confidence vote in June amid soaring inflation. The 42-year-old Harvard educated economist ran on an anti-corruption ticket and had urged voters to let him "continue the change" ahead of the vote. But he conceded defeat on Sunday evening after his We Continue to Change party took just 20.4% of the vote. Mr Petkov told reporters that "GERB has the responsibility to form a coalition and govern the country". He has already ruled out working with Mr Borissov, pledging to be an "opposition scrutinising the spending of every lev". Pundits say Bulgaria now faces an uncertain political outlook. "The situation is the same as after the last election but even more complicated," Daniel Smilov from the Centre for Liberal Strategies, told the BTV network. "Coalitions that were possible then are no longer possible now." Mr Borissov says he is willing to work with any party to form a working government, but is likely to have to rely on two pro-Russian parties and the Turkish minority MRF grouping. "What's important for us is for reason to prevail," he said on Sunday. "Believe me, right now I am the most well-meaning and open person to all parties."Whoever leads Bulgaria's next government, the EU's poorest nation faces a host of challenges. Inflation has continued to soar - hitting 15% in August - as energy prices spiral amid a dispute with the Russian state-owned gas giant Gazprom. And ministers will also face a difficult challenge managing the country's relationship with Moscow, after Mr Petkov's government turned its back on Vladimir Putin's regime in April. Bulgaria is an EU and Nato member, and Mr Borissov recently called President Putin the "clear aggressor" in Russia's war with Ukraine. Final results from Sunday's election are expected to come on Thursday after overseas postal votes are counted.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Omega Rakotomalala &amp; Farouk Chothia"><Text>Said to have been a shy but intelligent boy in school, Burkina Faso's Capt Ibrahim Traoré has become the latest military officer to seize power in a coup in one of France's former colonies in West Africa. He overthrew his former comrade, Lt Col Paul-Henri Damiba on 30 September, after accusing him of failing to fulfil his promise of quelling the Islamist insurgency that has gripped Burkina Faso since 2015.Born in 1988, this makes the 34-year-old captain the youngest head of state in Africa, joining the ranks of two other coup leaders - Guinea's charismatic Col Mamady Doumbouya, born in 1981, and Mali's bearded Col Assimi Goïta, born in 1983."I know I'm younger than most of you here. We didn't want what happened but we didn't have a choice," Capt Traoré told government officials.During Lt-Col Damiba's short time in power, attacks by militant Islamists - some of them linked to the Islamic State group and al-Qaeda - increased in Burkina Faso as they seized territory in rural areas and encircled cities, leaving the state in control of only about 60% of the country, according to some estimates. With a lack of strong democratic institutions in a country where the military has long been dominant, Capt Traoré seized power with a pledge to improve security in a nation living in fear of the militants. His coup - the second in Burkina Faso in less than nine months - is the latest sign of the epidemic of coups that UN chief António Guterres raised concern about in 2021."My appeal, obviously, is for - especially the big powers - to come together for the unity of the Security Council in order to make sure that there is effective deterrence in relation to this epidemic of coup d'états," Mr Guterres said at the time. But with global powers focused either on domestic crises - or the war in Ukraine - they have paid little attention to the instability that has wracked countries such as Burkina Faso. If anything, Burkina Faso and some other countries have found themselves increasingly embroiled in the cold war rivalry that has been reignited by the Ukraine conflict, as Russia seeks to expands its influence in the region at the expense of France, which has retained close economic, military and cultural ties to many of its former colonies in Africa. "I know that France cannot interfere directly in our affairs," Capt Traoré said, adding: "The Americans are our partners now, [but] we can also have Russia as a partner."His comments suggest that he could follow the example of his counterpart in Mali, who has allegedly brought in the controversial Russian security group, Wagner, to replace the French in the fight against jihadists, albeit with little success, as the insurgency has worsened there too since the military staged a coup in August 2020. Capt Traoré cut his teeth fighting the jihadists in Mali. He served in a UN force there, and reportedly "showed bravery" in the face of a "complex attack" by militants in the northern Timbuktu region - famous for its centuries-old buildings -  in 2018.The following year, he participated in a military operation codenamed Otapuanu in Burkina Faso's restive east for seven months. He also served in a detachment of Markoye in the northern Sahel region and took part in several operations there."Traore is close to his men, wilful and courageous. He could not do six months without going to a detachment," an unnamed source was quoted as saying on Burkina Faso's Radio Omega.But Capt Traoré  is no decorated war general, only a captain who studied at a local military academy, joined the army in 2009 and received artillery training in Morocco.He chose a military career after completing his schooling in Burkina Faso's second city, Bobo-Dioulasso, with reports describing him as "shy and rather reserved" but also "very intelligent".Now, Capt Traoré has found himself at the centre of international glare, with some going as far as drawing parallels between him and Burkina Faso's famous revolutionary, Thomas Sankara - not surprising in a nation looking for political saviours after decades of misrule."Ibrahim Traoré has taken over the leadership of the country, like a certain Thomas Sankara, [and] like him after a military coup, captain like him, 34 years old like him. Is this a twist of fate for a Burkina in search of new landmarks?" the privately-owned Wakat Sera website asked.Are military takeovers on the rise in Africa?Why African states are buying Turkish dronesHow Russia has outflanked Ukraine in AfricaWhy France faces so much anger in West Africa</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Frances Mao"><Text>Indonesians are demanding answers after a football match between two rival clubs turned into one of the worst disasters in the sport's history.On Saturday night, thousands of fans rushed onto the pitch after their home team lost a game at Kanjuruhan stadium in Malang, East Java. Police responded by firing tear gas.In the panic to escape, people were trampled and crushed at the exits. At least 125 - including dozens of children, one as young as three - were killed, the authorities say.Some fans died in the arms of the players they had come to cheer on just hours earlier, the coach of home team Arema FC revealed."I can only mention a terrifying scenario," Sergio Silva, a Portuguese star for the side said. "Police cars on fire, everything broken, corridors with blood, people's shoes."People were desperate, they had seen people die and were trying to escape," he told Portuguese sports newspaper, A Bola.Authorities on Monday launched an investigation - following allegations of heavy-handed policing. Public anger has escalated - with mourners chanting "murderers" at officials. At least 18 police officers are being investigated for their action on field.So how did this all unfold? Here's what we know so far.There had been concerns in the lead-up to the game - between Arema FC and long-time rivals, Persebaya Surabaya, another East Java-based team - as violence between fans was not unprecedented. So extra precautions were put in place - including more security "for preventive measures", Maike Ira Puspita, deputy secretary-general of the Indonesian Football Association, told the BBC.They also banned visiting Persebaya fans from coming to the match, meaning it was just a home crowd - an over-capacity attendance of 42,000 people - who roared on their team on Saturday night.The FA also deployed extra police. And during the game's first half, all was "manageable". "The security happening like usual," says Ms Puspita. "Half-time was ok."Eyewitnesses have disputed this, telling the BBC there was scuffles at half time with tensions building throughout the second half.When the game ended, Arema had lost 3-2. "And this is the point when some of the supporters ran onto the pitch. And it all just started to break out from there," Ms Puspita said.It is unclear - and in fierce contention - what exactly happened next. Authorities are unwilling to even specify a chronology of what happened on the field."I think it's better for all of us to wait for the investigation team," Ms Puspita told the BBC.But what is known is that after the final whistle blew, Arema fans moved onto the pitch, where the team's footballers were gathered in the middle. Police had already escorted Persebaya to their changing rooms, the BBC's Indonesian service reported.Sergio Silva said many of those streaming onto the field had appeared to come to "show support, not attack". But recognising the situation was escalating, the team returned to the changing rooms.At some point, police began to fire tear gas into the thousands-strong crowd, volleys aimed at dispersing them. One eyewitness told the BBC that police fired tear gas rounds "continuously and fast".Witnesses say police were unnecessarily brutal - and that along with the clouds of stinging gas, officers were beating fans with batons.The gas had an overwhelming effect - sparking a mass exodus. Fans fled down the field, heading towards the stadium's narrow exits. But with a crowd of thousands beating at each others' backs, and with many still suffering gas inhalation, it became a crush at the gates.In the scrabble to get out, people punched and clawed holes in the wall to try and pull themselves free. The weight of people pushing against the iron gates left them bent outwards. In other places, the crush left some people dying by the changing rooms.Huddled in the locker rooms, Silva said he and his teammates spent what felt like hours barricading themselves. They heard the roar of the crowd, the screams of distress in the corridors."People were desperate, they had seen people die and were trying to escape. We ended up letting in some of these people," he said.It was, he said, a scenario more reminiscent "of destruction, of war... nothing to do with football". "Fans died in the arms of players," Javier Roca, the Arema coach, told Spanish broadcaster Cadena Ser. "I'm mentally shattered. I feel a heavy burden, even a heavy responsibility." He added: "I think the police overstepped their mark."The exact death toll is yet to be confirmed. Many fans are undergoing treatment, and some of those injured are reported have suffered brain injuries.Police have characterised what happened as a riot in which two officers also died. They've accused fans of attacking officers and damaging cars - the burnt-out wreckage of vehicles can be seen in photographs. But anger against officials is rising: at vigils across the nation, protests have broken out calling for police to be held accountable. In the capital Jakarta, mourners chanted "Murderer! Murderer!" and taped signs reading "Kanjuruhan Massacre" to fences.In Malang, anti-police messages have been graffitied on the Kanjuruhan stadium.On Monday, Mohammad Mahfud Mahmodin, Indonesia's minister for political, legal and security affairs, said the government was asking police to "reveal the perpetrators involved in the crime".He said a soldier had been seen in footage carrying out an unauthorised act, without specifying what it was.Separately, the police have announced an investigation into 18 officers who were "holding the throwing weapons".Indonesia is known for violent flare-ups between rival football supporters. The country's police force also has a record of brutality - and has been criticised for frequently using tear gas, despite it being banned by Fifa, world football's governing body, as a crowd control measure."In many riots in football stadiums, police are accustomed to using tear gas - this is an abnormality that has been normalised," said Fajar Junaedi, a lecturer and football researcher at the Universitas Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta.He noted a case in 2012, where a supporter died from being tear-gassed by police and there was no follow-up investigation.Ms Puspita had earlier declined to answer the BBC's question on whether the police use of tear gas was a standard accepted procedure in the Liga.She stressed the actions organisers had taken earlier in the year to help teams manage crowds, including security workshops for first league clubs and coordination with police."At this point, it is unfair to point fingers. This is something that's a black day for all of us - a tragic and devastating incident," she said.Additional reporting by Raja Lumbanrau off BBC Indonesian</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Katy Watson"><Text>When the results came through on Sunday evening, there were cheers for Lula - as well as tears - but the atmosphere felt more like a sense of relief than outright celebration. This wasn't the first-round victory that his supporters had wished for. The polls released a day before the elections had predicted a 14 percentage point gap between Lula and Bolsonaro. They had hoped Lula could avoid a run-off but they vastly underestimated the support for the right-wing leader."I've never won an election in the first round, it's like destiny wants me to work a bit more," Lula said, trying to reassure people of his chances. "We are going to win the elections again, it's just a question of time."Lula is still the front-runner and his position is still strong. But there is no doubt this has been a blow to the Lula campaign. In the past few weeks, there had been a concerted effort by his supporters to try and encourage wavering voters to choose Lula, to end the Bolsonaro presidency promptly.Lula and Bolsonaro to face run-off in BrazilWhy Brazil's election matters so much to the US'Our candidate isn't perfect, but he beats the alternative'The show of strength from the right - not just from Bolsonaro but prominent Bolsonaristas who were also elected to congress and as state governors - has taken people by surprise."Bolsonarism is much more alive and has a further reach than people had thought and polls had captured," says Esther Solano, a political scientist and Bolsonaro expert."What we underestimated was the network of regional Bolsonarism. We have to rethink how we are failing to measure the true reach of Bolsonarism in daily life across Brazil."In his post-results speech, Bolsonaro adopted a more humble tone than in the past - a break from his often fiery politics about the left. Perhaps a conscious effort to win over those who are still undecided."I know there's a desire to change from people but there are certain changes that can be for the worse," he said. "We tried to show that during the campaign but clearly that didn't get through to the most important layers of society."Bolsonaro vowed to show people how to ensure Brazil wouldn't become Venezuela - it's a common comparison that the far-right makes when criticising the left.In the run-up to this vote, Bolsonaro repeatedly said that the polls were a lie - and to many it looked like he was just a bad loser. But reflecting on Sunday's results, there are people who think that Bolsonaro has a point. It's certainly what Bolsonaro's supporters believe."It's time for liberty, for justice," says teacher Selma Cardoso who said the polls were biased. If Lula wins she's prepared to take action. "We'll go to the streets saying people are making a mistake. It's time to change - but peacefully."But others who support the president threaten to take a more violent approach."There's going to be beautiful blood spilled in this city," Alessandro Ferreira Soares, a parachutist, told me if Lula takes the presidency. "I'm prepared to kill all the socialists and communists in the world."It's these ominous threats that make people worried. These next four weeks are going to be intense - and personal. With two powerful political foes now going head-to-head, the campaign steps up several notches.There's everything to play for in this presidential race - and everything to lose if you're on the wrong side. We saw political violence in the run-up to the first round and there's real fear there will be more of that ahead of the run-off.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Hugh Schofield"><Text>If France wants to lead Europe to a new era of military self-reliance, how come its contribution to the war effort in Ukraine is so small?That is the awkward question being posed by some of the country's top strategic thinkers, who are pushing President Emmanuel Macron to make an urgent decision on more arms to Kyiv.Recent analysis conducted on the ground in Poland and Ukraine shows that the French share of foreign arms deliveries is less than 2%, way behind the US on 49%, but also behind Poland (22%) and Germany (9%)."I was concerned about the reliability of the statistics which showed France low on the list of contributing countries," says François Heisbourg, who is perhaps France's most influential defence analyst."So I went out to the main distribution hub in Poland to see how much in tonnage was actually being delivered, rather than just promised."Unfortunately the figures bore out my fears. France is way down the list - in ninth position."The official reaction to this in Paris is: "Yes, but..." Yes, the aid statistics are unflattering, but there are other factors at work.First, defence officials say the true measure of military help is quality not quantity. Some countries are delivering masses of outdated equipment. France has given 18 Caesar self-propelled artillery units, which are now celebrated along the Ukrainian front-line.France, they add, is like other Western countries in having run down military stocks as part of the post-Cold War peace dividend.Ukraine's Caesars are fully one quarter of France's entire mobile artillery. It cannot offer much more without making itself vulnerable in regions where it is already committed, like the Sahel and the Indo-Pacific."It might look like we are behind other countries, but France has every intention of playing its part," says Gen Jérome Pellistrandi, editor of the National Defence Review.These arguments are not without merit, says Mr Heisbourg. The problem is that by not being more present in theatre, France risks writing itself out of the plot."When I was in Kyiv, everyone was very polite. I had no sense that the Ukrainians disapproved of us," he says. "In a way it was worse. I had the distinct feeling we were becoming irrelevant."For Mr Heisbourg the equation is simple. Ukraine will talk to countries who it knows are likely to deliver the weapons it needs. France at the moment is not one of them.But there is another danger for France. Its relative absence in Ukraine undermines its bid for leadership in the cause of European defence.Already many countries of eastern Europe are wary of President Macron, who they believe was far too indulgent towards Russia's Vladimir Putin in the first months of the war. A narrative has taken root according to which France still feels ambivalent about an outright Ukrainian triumph.For Pierre Haroche, who lectures on international security at Queen Mary University of London, this narrative is unfair - and is not the reason for France's low levels of arms deliveries to Ukraine.However, he is firmly of the view that France should beef up its contribution as early as possible, in order to reassure eastern European countries like Poland that "we are all on the same page". "France's goal of strategic autonomy for Europe is focused primarily on building up our defence industries via joint procurement. But if you want joint procurement, you have to demonstrate to other countries that you have the same vision about our common security," he says."In order to make our objective of European co-operation viable, we need to show eastern European countries that co-operating with France and buying the idea of strategic autonomy is not a strategic risk."Dr Haroche is calling for France to send 50 Leclerc main battle tanks. Mr Heisbourg would prefer air defence systems, which he says Ukraine is more in need of."It is like a fire extinguisher," says Dr Haroche. "If there is a fire in a neighbour's house it is better to offer your extinguisher straightaway, and not wait till the fire reaches your own home."It's not just generosity. It's also for your own protection." </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Navin Singh Khadka"><Text>Renowned US ski mountaineer Hilaree Nelson, who died in the Himalayas a week ago, was cremated on Sunday in a Buddhist ceremony in Nepal's capital Kathmandu. Fellow climbers have been telling the BBC how she was an inspirational figure to a generation of women.In 2012 Hilaree Nelson became the first woman to climb Everest (8,849m; 29,032 feet) and its neighbour, Lhotse (8,516m), within 24 hours. Six years later she was back on Lhotse, and she and her partner, Jim Morrison, became the first to ski down the mountain.On Monday 26 September, the couple were skiing down another Himalayan mountain, Manaslu (8,163m), when they triggered an avalanche that swept Hilaree Nelson over a cliff to her death, at the age of 49.Many of those paying tribute to her have noted that she was the equal of any male climber."She was doing things with top male mountain athletes, side by side," said Dave Watson, an international mountain guide who was on Mt Manaslu with Nelson and Morrison, before the couple left to climb to the summit."Her efforts were erasing the label of 'first male'/ 'first female' - it was 'first person'."She was a ground-breaking mountain sports athlete, and she did it with grace and a big smile. Hilaree's influence cannot be overstated."The 36-year-old Swedish climber and adventure athlete, Maria Granberg, who attended Hilaree Nelson's funeral, described her as a trailblazer and a "curious, committed, rare and resilient spirit" who was a role model for younger women."She led expeditions reaching out a hand to the younger generation to follow, showing the ropes, and our future selves got the memo of how to show up as an athlete and human being."In the most human way, she paved the way and shed a light on everything that we as female athletes aspire to become, by creating a life and career coloured by grace, grit and wild aspirations."Another younger climber, Melissa Arnot Reid - the first American woman to climb Everest without supplemental oxygen - met Hilaree Nelson on Everest 10 years ago, on the expedition when Nelson achieved the double of Everest and Lhotse in 24 hours. "She was so strong, so driven but had such willingness to be vulnerable," she told the BBC."As a female in this industry, it's so difficult to be vulnerable without seeming weak, but she did that perfectly and in doing so, showed me what was possible."Her mountain skills and fitness and drive were incredible, but I'm certain she will mostly be remembered for remaining exceptionally human while doing superhuman things."Hilaree Nelson carried out more than 40 expeditions in 16 countries, from the high Himalayas to one of the most remote mountains in Myanmar, and also Antarctica, where in 2020 she climbed the continent's two highest peaks - and skied down both.Billi Bierling, who heads the Himalayan database - keeping records of all expeditions on the Nepalese Himalayas - met Ms Nelson after her record-breaking ski descent from Lhotse in 2018."It was amazing to meet her, she was a great ski mountaineer," she says."The whole mountaineering scene is still very much in male hands. You do have some amazing women climbers, but Hilaree was an extreme skier too, while mountain skiing is also mainly male-dominated."Dave Watson, who was on Manaslu with Hilaree Nelson and Jim Morrison before they left for the summit, says he decided to stay put at camp three, because there were strong winds and a risk of avalanches. In fact, on the same day that the couple reached the summit there was another avalanche that killed one Sherpa and injured more than a dozen other climbers.Jim Morrison got down safely, though, after seeing Hilaree Nelson swept away, and was one of those who found her body on Wednesday.The outpouring of grief seen among the mountaineering community is a sign of how badly it has been rocked by her death, Ms Bierling says."She was a loving and a committed mother of two beautiful children."But by the same token, she fulfilled her dreams and she was beautiful and always very humble."</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Orla Guerin"><Text>As Russia's Vladimir Putin announces the annexation of swathes of sovereign Ukrainian territory, issues nuclear threats and mobilises hundreds of thousands of reservists, the response from Ukrainian forces on the eastern front is unchanged - they will fight for every last inch of soil.We travel to front-line positions in the city of Bakhmut in Donetsk - one of the four regions which President Putin is now illegally claiming as his own. Our journey is made in stages.We slow down to cross the Bakhmutovka river, speed up to cover exposed ground, then weave through a dangerous curtain of downed power lines. For the last few metres, we run. All the while, the shelling is constant - part of war's familiar soundscape.But when we reach the front-line troops, inside a battle-scarred building, we hear something else - the crackle of small arms fire. The two sides are so close they can target each other with rifles.The Russians are around 400 metres (437 yards) in front of us, and trying hard to close in. We are warned there is a Russian sniper to the rear. At his post below ground, where a ginger cat keeps him company, the unit commander is sombre and blunt. "It's pretty hard here now," says Oleksandr, a 31-year-old. "It's stressful. Everyone is under pressure. The enemy is very near, but we are standing and fighting back."He dismisses President Putin's recent referendums as "delusional" and says Ukrainians will not be dictated to at the barrel of a Russian gun. "In my view, those referendums will change nothing. We will fight Putin's army and make them withdraw from our land," he says. Oleksandr knows the cost of war - and not only from fighting his own battles."My brother died," he tells me, adding: "But I don't know where and when that happened, because he was drafted by a different drafting office from a different region. He died as well as a few of my comrades, officers who trained with me. I found out they were dead, too. So, I have lost family and friends."He has not lost his will to fight. Neither has 25-year-old Roman, who is operating a key weapon in this war - a drone.Roman is upstairs in a bombed-out room, littered with debris and broken glass, where two more cats are in residence. The screensaver on his phone is a picture of his five-month-old son Kyrylo, born since the war broke out. He has seen his only child once. "I see him in pictures and video, not in real life," he says. "It's hard, but it's also hard to imagine what the Russians could do to my family if they reach them. "I don't want them to do what they did in Bucha. I lived in Kyiv, and I understand clearly how the women feel. If we are weak, they will come for our families."There is concern here about the mobilisation in Russia. In the coming months the Kremlin will be sending many more soldiers into battle.It is unclear how well-trained or well-equipped they will be, but the Ukrainians are worried about the quantity, not the quality. They are already outnumbered. In the battle for Bakhmut they have faced a seemingly endless supply of Russian fighters. In August there were five waves in a row, according to Iryna, an army spokeswoman."They just go, and they don't stop. They don't react to firing or shelling. Some of the prisoners of war we captured were from Wagner [a Russian mercenary group]. They had better weapons," Iryna says. Troops here believe the Russians are pushing hard for victory in Bakhmut because of their recent humiliating defeats in the north-east and the south, where Ukraine reclaimed about 6,000 sq km (2,317 sq miles) of territory.For now, Bakhmut is stuck in President Putin's throat. It is an obstacle in his bid to swallow all of a mineral rich area known as Donbas - comprised of Donestk and Luhansk.  Having failed to fully capture Donbas, he has annexed both regions.As he tries to conquer Bakhmut - once home to about 70,000 people - the city has been bled of life.Downtown we see a large apartment block with the centre gouged out by an airstrike three months ago. Many of the windows are boarded up. It looks abandoned, but my colleague hears a woman's cry inside the building.We call out, and Lyudmila appears from behind the plastic sheeting that covers her window on the second floor. At first, it is difficult to hear her over the deep rumble of rocket fire."It's very hard," she shouts. "They bombard us. Yesterday a man was killed in the backyard [by shelling]. There's almost no-one left in the building. "Everything is leaking. There is water everywhere. All the walls are cracked. It is very difficult. But at least we get humanitarian aid. Every three days, they bring bread."The white-haired pensioner is living in the shattered building with her husband and a handful of others. "We can't go anywhere," she tells us. "We have no money, and I am in a wheelchair." A neighbour tells us the building has been hit five times. Lyudmila was in her kitchen when the missile struck on 1 July. "It came, out of the blue," she says. "God himself saved me."But can this city be saved?For now, the frontline is holding. Ukrainian forces are blocking the Russian advance. But here even the dead are not safe.There is an old cemetery on the city's green outskirts, in the path of incoming shells. Mounds of dark soil top the fresh graves - those killed in recent months, since the city became a battleground.As a coffin is lowered into the ground - watched by a few mourners - the silence is broken by shelling. The first launch is outgoing, but moments later an incoming round lands in the hills opposite the graveyard. Then a second strike, closer still. It is time to leave.As we race towards the edge of Bakhmut there is an explosion on the road right in front of us, between 100 to 200 metres ahead. We manage a sharp left turn and follow another route out.Many battles are still raging in Ukraine. President Putin is doubling down - and winter is coming.This is a dangerous new phase in Europe's newest war.When asked how long she thought the conflict would last, the army spokeswoman replied: "A long, long time."</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Bernd Debusmann Jr and Alexandra Ostasiewicz"><Text>For Renee Smith and her paralysed, cancer-stricken husband Christopher, evacuation was not an option when Hurricane Ian came violently bearing down on their Florida home. "It would have taken an ambulance, a stretcher, and three grown men to move him," she said of Christopher, who became paralysed just days before the hurricane as a result of prostate cancer spreading to his spine. "I had no control and it was terrifying."Without any other choices, Mrs Smith resorted to desperate measures to protect her husband. She used cable ties and gaffer tape to attach a tarpaulin to his hospital bed in a bid to keep him dry and used his wheelchair to barricade the front door from the 150mph (241km/h) winds. Even that, she feared, may have not been enough. "I'm his caretaker, so I stayed," she told the BBC from her home in Punta Gorda - one of the Gulf Coast communities hardest hit by the category four storm. "I put a life preserver around his neck, kissed him and told him I loved him."In Mrs Smith's case, the danger primarily came from the hurricane's ferocious winds. Many others were hit by a powerful storm surge. Suzie Mack, a Fort Myers resident, told the BBC that her brother's mobile home park saw water as high as 8ft during the storm. "They got on their air mattresses inside their house, because it was too late to leave, and by the time the surge got to its peak, they had about a foot of air left in their homes," she said. "Nobody died there, but it was a horrific story to hear." Not everyone was so lucky. So far, Florida officials have confirmed 44 deaths from the hurricane across the state - most of these in Lee County - with US networks reporting even higher tolls. Hurricane Ian - Maps and images showing destructionIn Pictures: Floridians take in Hurricane Ian's impactIn Ian's wake, some Florida residents have come under criticism for failing to heed repeated warnings and calls to evacuate. But for families like the Smiths and hundreds of thousands of others, logistical and financial hurdles to evacuation meant that staying was the only option. Others were simply trapped by bad luck.A woman who identified herself as Melodye, for example, fled from her home in the Tampa Bay area to Fort Myers. By the time it was clear that Ian's track had shifted south, it was too late for her to leave. "My area turned out to be safe, never got hit," she told the BBC at a mobile home park near Fort Myers. "I came down here and experienced the worst thing I've ever experienced in my whole life.""If there is another, I'm going to Chicago," she added. While for the moment the scale of Ian's destruction remains unclear, independent experts have warned that the economic impact is likely to be well into the tens of billions of dollars. Consultancy firm Milliman estimated that only 18% of people in areas under evacuation order had flood insurance, putting many residents in difficult or impossible financial situations as they seek to rebuild their homes or recover their losses. Governor Ron DeSantis - who called Ian a "500-year flood event" - said that the storm may well have "changed the character of our state".In these conditions, many Florida residents have been left wondering what their future looks like - and whether to stay in the state or to leave.  Tom, a 48-year-old resident of the town of Port Charlotte, 38 miles (61km) from Fort Myers, told the BBC that he decided to leave the morning after the storm along with his 66-year-old mother, Kathy. While the pair had already planned a move to Colorado, the hurricane prompted them to pack up and leave the morning after Ian passed. "The town is destroyed," Kathy said. So was her home for the last six years.For residents of the Sun Seekers mobile home park in North Fort Myers - many of them transplants from other parts of the US - the government may make the decision to relocate for them by declaring the property "uninhabitable". Cindy Brackett, a resident of the mobile home park, said that the prospect of being forced from her home was an additional and unwelcome trauma, just days after the violent hurricane. "With my arthritis, I can't do anything. I can't even walk out of my home. I feel so useless," Ms Brackett said. She doesn't want to leave and isn't sure where she would go if she had to.Federal officials and the American Red Cross say that about 10,000 displaced people are currently in shelters - not including people who may have taken shelter with friends, family or left the area entirely. State and federal officials have promised millions of dollars in relief funds, but many people on the ground remain sceptical of how - and whether - it will reach them. For those able - and willing - to stay, the effort to rebuild has already begun. Across damaged parts of western Florida, the BBC saw people beginning to clear debris from their homes and businesses, sweeping away palm fronds and parts of shattered houses. In some places, people were working to clear cars that had been overturned or crushed by felled trees, or boats that had been left sitting useless and far from the water."People around here are devastated," said Cal Bruno, the owner of a Fort Myers restaurant that gave away thousands of pasta meals to residents for free after the storm. "But we'll come together." Among those vowing to stay to help with the effort is construction worker Alejandro Carrera, an Argentine immigrant and 14-year resident of Fort Myers. "We will rebuild," he told the BBC, standing just feet from a shattered local marina. "I work in construction. I'm going to have a ton of work."Phoebe Gavin, a Washington-DC based native of Sanibel Island - whose aging parents fled across a causeway to nearby Fort Myer just ahead of the storm - said that she's "pessimistic" about the island's immediate reconstruction. Sanibel - which is located just off the coast and has a population of about 6,000 - was among the hardest-hit communities during the hurricane.Parts of the causeway connecting the barrier island to Florida were destroyed during the storm, severing access from the rest of the state. "I can't see it as a top priority as far as rebuilding," she said. "It would be shocking to me if we saw previous levels of road traffic within the next year."  A lack of connectivity to the mainland, she said, would be devastating to a community which survives largely on tourism. The alternative to a working causeway - a ferry - could potentially drive tourists away. "A lot of people would choose a much easier option," she said. Just across the shattered causeway in Fort Myers, pensioner Lucia Kim said that while she is confident that local communities will get back to normal sooner than later, she fears that some of the "spirit" of the area might be lost. "There is an atmosphere here," said Ms Kim, who moved from New York a decade ago attracted by the freedom and sense of community. "Just look at the 1960s architecture as well," she added, gesturing at art deco buildings in the distance. "Who knows what comes next?" After Hurricane Ian passed, Renee Smith cautiously emerged from her home to survey the damage.What she found wasn't encouraging. Her driveway remains covered in debris and detritus from nearby buildings, including some items she immediately recognised as having been ripped from a four-storey hotel blocks away. To make matters worse, Mrs Smith's front door won't shut, her chimney has collapsed and parts of her roof were blown away, leaving her and her bedridden husband partially exposed to the elements. Mrs Smith, however, sees things that may suggest that the damage in her devastated community could ultimately lead to a stronger and more resilient neighbourhood. Many of the buildings rebuilt after previous hurricanes - such as 2004's Hurricane Charley - managed to weather the storm better than the rest of the town. In any case, her husband's condition means that rain or shine, she'll be staying put. She has no choice.  For the moment, however, she is simply happy that mother nature has given her a reprieve. Since Hurricane Ian passed, the sun is back out while Florida's often oppressive heat has been replaced by more comfortable temperatures. "We're very fortunate," she said of the conditions after the storm. "It could have been a lot worse."Additional reporting from John Sudworth and Azadeh Moshiri</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Orla Guerin"><Text>Victory can look desolate. It does inside the eastern Ukrainian town of Lyman, retaken from the Russians at the weekend. The deserted debris-strewn streets are lined by boarded up or burnt-out buildings. Metal sheeting dangling from smashed roofs is buffeted by the wind. Few civilians venture out. We counted almost as many dogs as people - though the population was around 20,000 before the war.The handful of civilians we met seem shell-shocked by months of bombardment, and uncertain their ordeal is over.The only surge of life was a convoy of Ukrainian troops riding high on top of armoured personnel carriers, waving and cheering, as they headed out of town, along a road bordered by pine forest.They roared past evidence of the human cost of Russia's defeat.The bodies of five dead Russian soldiers lay near each other, now bloated, and contorted by death, but once somebody's husband or somebody's son. They were in full uniform, with boots still on, as if they might somehow return to the fight.  They appear to have been cut down together as they tried to flee. Nearby we saw a heap of discarded Russian uniforms, sleeping bags, and ration packs. There was an army backpack with a name written on it. We don't know what became of its owner. Two young volunteers from a Ukrainian humanitarian group were working carefully and quietly, numbering the bodies, and looking for anything that might identify them.   They were kneeling just metres away from mines scattered along the roadside, their dark green colour camouflaged by the grass and leaves. They are a lingering threat from an enemy that has been driven into retreat, or as Russia's defence ministry put it, was "withdrawn to more advantageous positions". That statement has a familiar ring to it after the domino of Russian routs last month in Kharkiv province in the north-east.Later the volunteers manoeuvred the remains into black body bags and drove them away - some of Russia's fallen soldiers finally leaving the battlefield.A new Ukrainian flag was flying atop a captured Russian T72  tank, parked by the roadside. "We are going to win," said the smiling young Ukrainian soldier clambering around the gun turret. "I feel very good, very great." What happened here isn't just a defeat for President Vladimir Putin. It's a complete humiliation. Just last Friday he announced to the world he was annexing four Ukrainian regions, including Donetsk, where Lyman is located. He proclaimed that they would be "Russian forever".A day later Ukrainian forces were inside Lyman, and his troops were running for their lives.Ukraine says as many as 5,000 Russian troops were encircled in Lyman, before the town fell. We don't know how many were killed or captured. The defence ministry in Kyiv said in a tweet that almost all the Russian troops deployed to Lyman had been "redeployed either into body bags or into captivity".The strategic town is a gateway to the neighbouring region of Luhansk, which is almost entirely in Russia's grip. Ukraine is hoping to advance further, using its victory here as a springboard.Lena and her 10-year-old Radion are hoping for peace, and for running water.  We met the mother and son heading for a well to refill a five-litre container."I think it will be peaceful," said Lena, who wore a black hat and a few layers of woollen jumpers, "It should be peaceful. Everyone has suffered enough. The hardest thing was to survive the shelling. We prayed as we stayed in the cellar. The situation is still tense but overall, I am happy."While deprived of school, Radion has learnt the lessons of war. His face is sombre, beneath his deep blue hat. "It was a bit scary in Lyman," he tells us "because there was a lot of bombing. War is very bad because people are dying. It's more peaceful in my heart now."Others here still seem lost in their trauma, like 66-year-old Nadia. She was alone on the streets, walking slowly, as if she could not recognise her surroundings."I hope for the best," she said "and that they [the Russians] won't come back here. It was very bad. Both sides were firing. We didn't understand anything. When it was quiet, we went outside to cook. Then it started again. We have all gone mad now."And she had a question for us. "Why am I being bombarded?" she beseeched us. "I didn't do anything bad. I didn't kill. I didn't steal. I don't understand why. Maybe you can tell me. We lived well, everything was good, we worked.  And in one moment it was turned upside down."In the streets around town pro-Russian slogans have been daubed on walls, kiosks and bus shelters. "CCCP" is daubed on a closed shop front - the Cyrillic letters for USSR, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.Much as President Putin may wish to resurrect the Soviet Union of his youth, the ruins of Lyman stand as testament to his failure.Ukraine now has momentum and knows it must move fast, Western weapons supplies permitting. Battle lines will harden when freezing weather comes. The window for reclaiming more territory this winter may close in a few weeks. </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Laurence Peter and Matt Murphy"><Text>Ukrainian troops have retaken more territory in regions illegally annexed by Russia, with Kyiv's forces advancing near the southern city of Kherson and consolidating gains in the east. Russian-installed officials in Kherson confirmed the advance, but said Moscow's forces were digging in.Ukrainian troops also moved towards Russian-held Luhansk in the east.Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said "there are new liberated settlements in several regions".Speaking during his nightly address, President Zelensky said "fierce fighting continues in many areas", but he did not give details. The progress of Ukraine's counterattacks have been closely guarded and reporters have largely been kept away from the front lines.But in the south, Vladimir Saldo, the Russian-installed leader in the Kherson region, admitted that Ukrainian forces had broken through near Dudchany, a town on the Dnipro river about 30km (20 miles) south of the previous front line. The river is called Dnieper by Russians."There are settlements that are occupied by Ukrainian forces," Mr Saldo said. Some Russian reports say the Ukrainians have now taken Dudchany.Russian defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said "numerically superior" Ukrainian tanks had "driven a deep wedge" south of Zolota Balka, a village that marked the previous front line on the Dnipro. He claimed the Russians had killed about 130 Ukrainian troops in that fighting.According to Mr Saldo, two Ukrainian battalions tried to reach the Kakhovka hydroelectric station, about 70km (44 miles) east of Kherson. The power station is in the port city of Nova Kakhovka. The Ukrainian advance is targeting supply lines for as many as 25,000 Russian troops on the west bank of the Dnipro, Reuters news agency reports.Meanwhile, in the east, Kyiv's troops have continued an advance that has made inroads into Luhansk, a province annexed by Moscow last week and previously under almost complete Russian control. On Saturday, Ukrainian forces recaptured the important hub town of Lyman in the east, near the Luhansk regional border. Russia's military had turned Lyman into a logistical base.A commander of Russia's proxy forces in Luhansk said Ukrainian troops had pushed a few kilometres into the region before being killed. The BBC cannot confirm these claims. And reports suggest that the Ukrainians are moving towards the Russian-held towns of Kreminna and Svatove in Luhansk, with some pro-Kremlin bloggers suggesting that Russian forces have again been ordered to retreat.Kherson and Luhansk are among four regions which Russian President Vladimir Putin has declared to be part of Russia, following so-called referendums denounced as fraudulent by Kyiv and its Western allies. Russia does not fully control any of the four regions.On Monday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov attracted ridicule online after he admitted that Russia was still deciding which areas it had "annexed", suggesting that Moscow does not know where its self-declared borders are. Mr Peskov claimed the entirety of Luhansk and Donetsk regions were part of Russia, but said the Kremlin would "continue consultations with the population regarding the borders of the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions". Kyiv has vowed to retake all the territory annexed by Russia, including Crimea, seized by Russian troops in 2014.The Russian defence ministry says reservists drafted under Mr Putin's mobilisation order last month are undergoing intensive combat training in the Russian-controlled Luhansk and Donetsk regions. The Kremlin plans to call up about 300,000 reservists - though Mr Putin did not set an upper limit.ANALYSIS: Who is winning the war in Ukraine?ON THE GROUND: What weapons are being supplied to Ukraine?READ MORE: Full coverage of the crisis</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By David Gritten"><Text>Schoolgirls in Iran have been waving their headscarves in the air and chanting against clerical authorities, in an unprecedented show of support for the protests engulfing the country.Videos verified by the BBC showed demonstrations inside schoolyards and on the streets of several cities.They echoed the wider unrest sparked by the death last month of a woman who was detained for breaking the hijab law.In Karaj, girls reportedly forced an education official out of their school.Footage posted on social media on Monday showed them shouting "shame on you" and throwing what appear to be empty water bottles at the man until he retreats through a gate.The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterIn another video from Karaj, which is just to the west of the capital Tehran, students are heard shouting: "If we don't unite, they will kill us one by one." In the southern city of Shiraz on Monday, dozens of schoolgirls blocked traffic on a main road while waving their headscarves in the air and shouting "death to the dictator" - a reference to the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the final say on all state matters.The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterFurther protests by schoolgirls were reported on Tuesday in Karaj, Tehran and the north-western cities of Saqez and Sanandaj.A number of students were also photographed standing in their classrooms with their heads uncovered. Some were raising their middle fingers - an obscene gesture - at portraits of Ayatollah Khamenei and the founder of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.Analysis by Rana Rahimpour, BBC PersianAfter almost three weeks of protests, it is clear that Iran's leadership is facing a serious challenge. Its opponents are no longer just politicians or people in their 20s. It is now facing teenagers - schoolgirls who are not scared of burning photos of the supreme leader.The protests have continued despite Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's warning on Monday that they were "riots" orchestrated by the West. Many of those taking part simply want a normal life. They might not understand politics, but they understand that they are not free to live their lives the way they want. Now, every school and university could potentially become a headquarters for the protesters. Every day at school, teenagers will be able to get together and exchange ideas about how to overthrow the regime. The question is whether and how the Islamic Republic will be able to stop them. The protests by the schoolgirls began hours after Ayatollah Khamenei, who has final say on all state matters, broke his silence on the unrest and accused the United States and Israel, Iran's arch-enemies, of orchestrating "riots".  He also gave his full backing to the security forces, which have responded to the protests with a violent crackdown.The unrest was triggered by the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish woman who fell into a coma after being detained by morality police on 13 September in Tehran for allegedly violating the law requiring women to cover their hair with a hijab, or headscarf. She died in hospital three days later.Her family has alleged that officers beat her head with a baton and banged her head against one of their vehicles. The police have denied that she was mistreated and said she suffered "sudden heart failure".The first protests took place in Kurdish-populated north-western Iran, where Ms Amini lived, and then spread rapidly across the country. Iran Human Rights, a Norway-based group, reported on Tuesday that at least 154 people had been killed by security forces so far. They include 63 protesters whom ethnic Baluch activists said had died in clashes in the south-eastern city of Zahedan on Friday.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Elsa Maishman"><Text>At least four people have been killed and dozens are missing after an avalanche struck a team of mountaineers high in the Indian Himalayas.The 34 trainees and seven instructors were practising navigation when they were hit on their descent from a peak in the northern state of Uttarakhand. Eight of the party are believed to have been rescued and the rest are trapped in a crevasse, rescuers say.Search efforts have been paused for the night because of rain and snowfall.Local media reports say the number of casualties may rise significantly. The group was made up of trainees from the nearby Nehru Institute of Mountaineering. It said they had been returning from Mount Draupadi Danda-2 (5,670m; 18,602 feet) when the avalanche struck. Authorities were alerted at around 09:30 local time on Tuesday (04:00 GMT), rescue workers said. "We have confirmation of four deaths out of the 33 people trapped. Around eight of them have already been rescued and the rest are trapped in a crevasse," Ridhim Aggarwal from the State Disaster Response Force told AFP news agency. Rescue efforts will continue as long as the weather allows, he said. Earlier, Uttarakhand police chief Ashok Kumar told Reuters news agency: "The Indian Air Force is doing an aerial recce of the mountain where this happened. It is not easy to reach the spot." Defence Minister Rajnath Singh wrote on Twitter: "Deeply anguished by the loss of precious lives due to landslide which has struck the mountaineering expedition carried out by the Nehru Mountaineering Institute in Uttarkashi."It comes a week after the body of famed US ski mountaineer Hilaree Nelson was found in the Nepali Himalayas. Ms Nelson, regarded as one of the greatest mountaineers of her generation, was reported to have fallen into a deep crevasse after reaching the summit of Mount Manaslu.On the same day she went missing, one person was killed and more than a dozen injured in an avalanche lower down on the same peak.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Hugh Schofield"><Text>Paris has become the latest French city to announce that it will not be setting up giant screens and fan zones for the approaching World Cup in Qatar.It cited human rights and environmental concerns in the host nation.Lille, Marseille, Bordeaux, Strasbourg and Reims are also boycotting the competition on ethical grounds.Pierre Rabadan, in charge of sport at Paris City Hall, said the fact the event was taking place in winter was also a factor in the city's decision.The movement began on Saturday after the Socialist mayor of Lille, Martine Aubry, declared that the Qatar World Cup was a "nonsense in terms of human rights, the environment and sport".Like other mayors - of both left and right - she blamed concerns over workers' rights in Qatar; the alleged high number of deaths among foreign labourers; and the environmental impact of the stadiums, all equipped with outdoor air conditioning.In Marseille, there had been plans for a giant screening if France made it to the final, but that has now been cancelled.The city's Socialist mayor, Benoit Payan, said the competition "had progressively turned itself into a human and environmental catastrophe, incompatible with the values which we expect sport - and especially football - to promote".It was unclear how many French cities were actually making preparations for outdoor venues where supporters could follow the progress of the French team, world champions in Russia 2018.The mayor of Angoulême in south-west France said his decision was as much financial as to do with human rights in Qatar.Why is the Qatar World Cup so controversial?FA criticised for 'delay' over Qatar statement"It seemed incongruous to us to risk this kind of expense at a time when we are trying to make economies to absorb the growing cost of energy," said Xavier Bonnefont, citing a giant screen cost of "several tens of thousands of euros"."In any case frankly in winter I don't think there would have been many people turning up. The public will be just as happy in a bar."Calls for a boycott of the World Cup, which takes place between 21 November and 18 December, have been growing in France, though they remain far from mainstream.The former international and Manchester United star Eric Cantona said he would not be watching any matches, adding: "Let's be honest, this World Cup makes no sense. It is an aberration."Government spokesman Olivier Véran said: "If we were to make the decision today, we would not give the World Cup to Qatar.  However when something was decided 10 years ago by 100 countries, it's difficult to say stop just a few weeks before it gets under way."</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="BBC News, author unspecified"><Text>Twitter shares have been suspended following a report that Elon Musk will proceed with a takeover of the social media platform.Mr Musk is set to buy Twitter at the original price he offered months ago before he walked away from a deal, sources told US media.Shares in Twitter were up almost 13% before trading was halted.Mr Musk was due to face Twitter in court later this month after he tried to pull out of the takeover.Mr Musk offered to pay $54.20 per share for the company in April, in a deal that valued the social media platform at $44bn.But he balked at the deal just a few weeks later, citing concerns that the number of bots on the platform was higher than Twitter claimed.Twitter denied the accusations and sued Mr Musk to force the deal to go through.The back-and-forth came amid a sharp downturn in the value of technology stocks, including Tesla, the electric car company that Mr Musk leads and is the base of much of his wealth. Twitter accused Mr Musk of wanting out because he was worried about the price.The fight between Mr Musk and Twitter, which was scheduled to go to trial 17 October, had ensnarled many of the biggest names in tech, as lawyers for the two companies demanded communications about the deal.Mr Musk, who could have paid a $1bn break-up fee to walk away from the deal, was set to be interviewed ahead of the trial this week.Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said Mr Musk's chance of winning was "highly unlikely"."Being forced to do the deal after a long and ugly court battle in Delaware was not an ideal scenario and instead accepting this path and moving forward with the deal will save a massive legal headache," he wrote in a report after the news.But he added, that Mr Musk's ownership of the platform, a top venue for politicians and journalists to spread news and opinion, would still likely to cause a "firestorm of worries and questions" in Washington and beyond.It's never dull with Musk. Elon Musk has for months now been trying to get out of this deal. In doing so he has argued that Twitter is full of bots.He has said on multiple occasions that Twitter may have many times more fake accounts than it admits to.By making these claims he has helped to tarnish the reputation of the company.Advertisers are nervous - they want to buy ads that are seen by humans, with wallets, not bots.So for Elon Musk to then offer to buy the company again, at the initial price, seems bizarre.Twitter is reportedly looking at Mr Musk's offer closely. Musk's behaviour in this deal has so far been erratic. Could this be a legal strategy to delay a court case?But if this reported offer is credible it's a massive win for Twitter's shareholders and its lawyers. Many Twitter employees, however, will be less pleased. I've spoken to several employees who are privately nervous about a Musk takeover, and what that might mean for moderation policies - and more acutely - their own job security.And as for Twitter's CEO Parag Agrawal? Well emails disclosed last week suggests he doesn't get along well with Musk.A Musk Twitter takeover would almost certainly mean a new person in charge of the company.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="BBC News, author unspecified"><Text>A Nigerian boy has been killed by his brother while testing a newly bought "bullet-proof" charm, police say.The two believed they had "fortified themselves with the protective charm", according to police in Kwara stateAbubakar Abubakar then shot at his younger brother Yusuf, 12, using their father's rifle, officers say.

He was then arrested for kicking an officer while in custody.Gilman told the court in Voronezh, south-western Russia, that he did not remember the incident but "apologised to Russia" and to the officer.After being found guilty, Gilman - 28 and from Massachusetts - said the sentence requested by the prosecution was too strict.The lawyers told TASS, the Russian state news agency, that Gilman was in Russia to study and obtain citizenship. Gilman was reportedly staying in Sochi, but headed by train to Moscow to replace his damaged passport at the US Embassy.His lawyers said they would appeal against the court's decision and contact US officials to seek a prisoner exchange.There have been several high-profile cases of Americans being sentenced to lengthy prison terms in Russia recently. This could lead to prisoner swaps, a process often seen as "hostage diplomacy", where countries try to use people as bargaining chips. Another ex-marine, Trevor Reed, was freed in April in a prisoner swap after being found guilty of violence against a police officer on a night out in Russia.And another former US marine, Paul Whelan, is serving 16 years for spying charges after a short trial was conducted entirely behind closed doors.He maintains his innocence, and describes himself the victim of "greasy, slimy Russian politics".How Brittney Griner's case throws spotlight on hostage diplomacyUS basketball star Brittney Griner was sentenced to nine years in prison on drug charges by a Russian court in August.The double Olympic winner admitted possessing cannabis oil, but told the court she had made an "honest mistake".The US claims she's being wrongfully detained. It is unclear how long she will spend behind bars, as the US and Russia have reportedly discussed a prisoner swap involving Russian arms trafficker, Viktor Bout. </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Mark Savage"><Text>Loretta Lynn, whose songs of strength and independence made her a standard-bearer for women in country music, has died at the age of 90.Known as the Queen of Country, her songs were rooted in real-life experience, most notably on the autobiographical Coal Miner's Daughter.Other hits included Don't Come Home A-Drinkin', Honky Tonk Girl and the feminist anthem, The Pill.Lynn's family said she died on Tuesday at her home in Tennessee."Our precious mom, Loretta Lynn, passed away peacefully this morning, October 4th, in her sleep at home in her beloved ranch in Hurricane Mills," the family said in a statement. They asked for privacy as they grieve and said a memorial would be announced later.  The singer was born Loretta Webb in a one-room log cabin in Butcher Hollow, Kentucky in 1932. She was the second of eight children.Just as she would later sing in Coal Miner's Daughter, her family eked out a living during the Depression, with her father earning a "poor man's dollar" by working all night in the coal mines, and all day in the fields "a-hoein' corn".The family made its own entertainment - her mother played guitar, with her father accompanying on banjo - and she grew up on the songs of the Carter Family."I was singing when I was born, I think," she told the Associated Press in 2016. "Daddy used to come out on the porch where I would be singing and rocking the babies to sleep. "He'd say, 'Loretta, shut that big mouth. People all over this holler can hear you.' And I said, 'Daddy, what difference does it make? They are all my cousins.'"At the age of 15, she attended a "pie social" - where local girls would bake a pie, and men would bid to win both the food and a meeting with the cook. Loretta's pie, accidentally baked with salt instead of sugar, was won by Oliver Lynn, a 21-year-old solider, who swept her off her feet. A month later, they married and moved to Custer, Washington, where they raised four children.Her husband, whom she called "Doo" or "Doolittle," urged her to sing professionally and bought her a $17 (£15) Sears guitar, with which she started a band, Loretta and the Trailblazers, that also featured her brother Jay Lee Webb.By 1960, she had signed a contract with Zero Records and released her debut single, I'm a Honky Tonk Girl. The song was inspired by a woman Lynn befriended in Washington, whose husband had left her for another woman. Lynn said she wrote the song while leaning up against an old toilet in her house, the words pouring out of her in a 10-minute burst of inspiration.She and her husband promoted the song relentlessly, driving to radio stations around the country to pester DJs into playing it, and sending out hundreds of free discs.The effort paid off. I'm A Honky Tonk Girl reached number 14 on the country charts, and Lynn relocated to Nashville, where she was quickly snapped up by Decca Records. She released her first Decca record, Success, in 1962, beginning an impressive stretch of hits that continued into the 1990s.Lynn earned her first number one with Don't Come Home a Drinkin' (With Lovin' on Your Mind) in 1966, and topped the US country charts another 15 times. She recorded 60 albums in total, and was nominated for 18 Grammy Awards, winning three.Her songs frequently depicted broken relationships and unhappy homes - but were unusual for expressing a female point of view at a time when that was unheard of in country music. Many addressed Doolittle's infidelity and alcoholism. You Ain't Woman Enough (To Take My Man) and Fist City were feisty warnings to any woman who considered approaching her husband, while 1971's I Wanna Be Free fantasised about divorce. "I'm gonna take this chain from around my finger / And throw it just as far as I can sling," sang Lynn."I've wrote every song I ever wrote about him," she told a BBC Arena documentary. "He gave me a lot of opportunities."Lynn later confessed that the relationship could turn violent - although she gave as good as she got."If he smacked me or anything, I'd stand up and be fightin' him just like I'd be fightin' the other woman," she told PBS's American Masters documentary in 2016. "He'd smack me, I'd smack him; he'd pull my hair, I pulled his hair. That's the way it was." Despite their troubles, the couple stayed together for 48 years until Oliver's death in 1996.Lynn's songs weren't just about relationships, however. Dear Sam was inspired by the women left at home during the Vietnam War, with lyrics that ran: "Don't misunderstand/ I know he's fighting for our land / I really love my country/ But I also love my man", while The Pill was a frank and funny celebration of reproductive choice. "This old maternity dress I've got is going in the garbage/The clothes I'm wearing from now on won't take up so much yardage," sang the star. "Miniskirts, hot pants and a few little fancy frills/Yeah, I'm making up for all those years since I've got the pill."Although she wasn't initially credited as a writer, it later transpired she had played a part in its composition. Speaking to NPR in 2010, the mother of six said the lyrics spoke directly to her own experiences."If I'd had [the pill] I would have used it," she said. "'Cause back when I was having all the kids, we didn't have birth-control pills. Or if we did, I didn't know anything about them."The subject matter meant her record label held the single back for several years. When it was finally released in 1975, many country radio stations refused to play it, keeping it from hitting number one. But it still reached the top five, and became Lynn's biggest crossover pop hit.By that time, Lynn had begun a professional partnership with country star Conway Twitty, with whom she scored hits like After the Fire Is Gone, Louisiana Woman, Mississippi Man and As Soon As I Hang Up The Phone. The musicians were named vocal duo of the year by the Country Music Association for four consecutive years from 1972 to 1975.Lynn published her autobiography, also called Coal Miner's Daughter, in 1976, and it was turned into a film in 1980, earning Sissy Spacek an Oscar for best actress.The musician's output slowed in the 1980s and she announced her retirement in the 1990s - although she still managed to release a handful of albums, including 1993's Honky Tonk Women, a collaboration with fellow country music trailblazers Dolly Parton and Tammy Wynette. In the meantime, she turned her attention to food, launching a restaurant called Loretta Lynn's Kitchen, and a series of cookbooks that mixed recipes with stories from her life.She also opened the Loretta Lynn Ranch in Tennessee - Lynn's equivalent to Parton's Dollywood - which hosts a museum and campsite, and stages regular music events. In 2004, her career was resurrected by super-fan Jack White, who encouraged her back into the studio for an album that combined his abrasive rock sound with Lynn's penchant for pedal steel and banjo.The album showed that her narrative power was undiminished (one song, Ms Leroy Brown, told of a bored housewife who stole her husband's savings to rent a limousine and go on a bender) and gained her a new audience at the age of 72, as well as the Grammy Award for best country album.In 2013, Lynn was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honour in the United States, by President Barack Obama.Later albums included Full Circle, a mix of new songs and remakes of old standards, and 2021's Still Woman Enough, which saw her duet with Margo Price and Tanya Tucker.Lynn stopped touring in 2017 after a stroke, and suffered a broken hip after falling over at home the following year. But she continued to perform and record, and forcefully denied tabloid reports at the time that her health was failing."Through the years they've said I'm broke, homeless, cheating, drinking, gone crazy, terminally ill, and even dead! Poor things can't ever get it right," she wrote on Facebook. "I guess if those old pesky tabloids are harassing me then they're giving someone else a break... but I'm about an inch from taking 'em to Fist City!"It was that down-to-earth gutsiness that endeared her to fans over the last six decades, and one that ensures her music still feels relevant."I like real life, because that's what we're doing today," she said 2004. "And I think that's why people bought my records, because they're living in this world and so am I. So I see what's going on, and I grab it."Lynn is survived by four of her six children: Clara, Ernest and twins Peggy and Patsy, as well as 17 grandchildren and four step-grandchildren.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Jean Mackenzie, Yvette Tan &amp; Rupert Wingfield-Hayes"><Text>North Korea has fired a ballistic missile over Japan, in what appears to be a deliberate escalation to get the attention of Tokyo and Washington.The missile travelled 4,500km (2,800 miles) before falling into the Pacific Ocean - far enough to hit the US island of Guam if it took another trajectory.It is the North's first missile launch over Japan since 2017. Japan issued an alert to some citizens to take cover.The US, Japan and South Korea conducted their own military drills in response.South Korean and US aircraft fired at a mock target on an uninhabited island in the Yellow Sea, while the US and Japan also jointly carried out drills over the Sea of Japan.The UN prohibits North Korea from testing ballistic and nuclear weapons. Flying missiles towards or over other countries without any warning or consultation also contravenes international norms. Most countries avoid doing it completely as it can easily be mistaken for an attack. While it is not as big as a nuclear test - which could be next - it can be considered hugely provocative.People in the north of Japan, including Hokkaido island and Aomori city, reportedly woke up to the noise of sirens and text alerts which read: "North Korea appears to have launched a missile. Please evacuate into buildings or underground."As the missile flew overhead, they were warned to look out for falling debris. Many remained calm, though, with one video showing Tokyo commuters walking normally as loudspeakers blared out warnings. But others were more shaken. "If a missile hit, I was worried it would be a big problem not only here but also nationwide," Aomori resident Kazuko Ebina told the Asahi Shimbun newspaper.Officials later said the intermediate-range ballistic missile fell into the Pacific Ocean far from Japan, and there were no reported injuries.It had covered the longest distance ever travelled by a North Korean missile, and reached a height of around 1,000km - higher than the International Space Station. Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida described the launch as "violent behaviour", while defence minister Yasukazu Hamada said Japan would not rule out any options to strengthen its defences including "counterattack capabilities". US President Joe Biden reinforced Washington's "ironclad commitment" to Japan's defence during a phone call with Mr Kishida, while the two leaders jointly condemned the missile test, a White House statement said.They confirmed they would work closely with South Korea and the international community to coordinate an immediate and longer-term response to the threat posed by the North, it added.Last week, the three countries conducted naval exercises together for the first time since 2017. Such drills have long antagonised Pyongyang leader Kim Jong-un, who views them as proof that his enemies are preparing for war. Following the combined exercises in 2017, North Korea fired two missiles over Japan in response. A week later, it conducted a nuclear test.Recent intelligence has suggested that North Korea is getting ready to test another nuclear weapon.It is expected that North Korea would wait until after China - its main ally - holds its Communist party congress later this month.But some experts are now asking if it could come sooner than expected - they believe Tuesday's launch shows that North Korea is preparing the ground for a nuclear test.N Korea missile tests: What does Kim Jong-un want?What missiles does North Korea have?North Korea tests banned intercontinental missile The missile launch is the fifth carried out by Pyongyang in a week. On Saturday, two rockets came down in waters outside Japan's exclusive economic zone. Many of North Korea's missile tests are conducted on a high, lofted flight path - reaching a high altitude, avoiding flights over its neighbours.But firing over or past Japan allows North Korean scientists to test missiles under circumstances "that are more representative of the conditions they'd endure in real-world use", analyst Ankit Panda told news agency Reuters.These actions have contributed to enduring tensions between North Korea and Japan, rooted in Japan's colonisation of Korea from 1910 to 1945 and the North's abduction of Japanese citizens in the past.Earlier this month, North Korea passed a law declaring itself to be a nuclear weapons state, with leader Kim Jong-un ruling out the possibility of talks on denuclearisation. Pyongyang conducted six nuclear tests between 2006 and 2017, incurring widespread sanctions. The East Asian state regularly defies the ban on nuclear and missile tests, saying it needs to bolster its defences.Additional reporting by Nathan Williams. </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="BBC News, author unspecified"><Text>North Korea has fired a missile over Japan, which travelled about 4,500km (2,800 miles) before falling into the Pacific Ocean.It has been conducting regular missile tests as part of its weapons programme, but this is the first launch over Japan since 2017.North Korea has carried out more than 30 missile tests this year - using some with a long enough range to reach the US. These include ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and hypersonic missiles.Hypersonic missiles fly at several times the speed of sound and at low altitude, to escape radar detection. The latest missile tested over Japan is thought to be an intermediate-range Hwasong-12, which has a range of 4,500km - far enough to hit the US island of Guam from North Korea."North Korea has been testing missiles with longer and longer ranges," says Joseph Byrne, research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute."This is the longest-range missile it's ever fired over Japan. It could be the precursor to it testing another nuclear warhead, which has been predicted for some time." North Korea has also been testing the Hwasong-14 ballistic missile.This has a range of 8,000km - although some studies have suggested it could travel as far as 10,000km, making it capable of reaching New York.It is the first of North Korea's intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). The Hwasong-15 missile is believed to have a range of 13,000km, putting all of the continental US in its sights.In October 2020, North Korea unveiled the latest of its ballistic missiles - the Hwasong-17. It is believed to have a range of 15,000km or more.It could possibly carry three or four warheads, rather than only one - making it harder for a nation to defend itself.The unveiling of the new missiles appeared to be a message to the Biden administration of the North's growing military prowess, say experts.In March 2021, it carried out a launch of what it called a "new-type tactical guided projectile", which it said was able to carry a payload of 2.5 tons - so capable of in theory of carrying a nuclear warhead. Analysts at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies told Reuters that it appeared to be "an improved variant" of a previously tested missile, the KN-23. The last time North Korea tested a nuclear bomb was in 2017. The explosion at its Punggye-ri test site had a force, or "yield", of between 100-370 kilotons. A 100 kiloton bomb is six times more powerful than the one the US dropped on Hiroshima in 1945.North Korea claimed this was its first thermonuclear device - the most powerful of all types of atomic weapon.However, North Korea may now be aiming to test a smaller type of nuclear warhead with similar explosive force, according to Mr Byrne. "It seems they are now testing a new capability - a miniaturised warhead that can be fitted onto a range of missiles, including short-range missiles" he says. Six underground tests have previously been carried out at Punggye-ri. However, in 2018 North Korea said it would shut the site down, because it had "verified" its nuclear capabilities.Some of the tunnels into the site were subsequently blown up in the presence of foreign journalists. However, North Korea did not invite international experts to verify if it had been put beyond use.Satellite images released earlier this year suggest work to renovate Punggye-ri had started.Any future nuclear testing at the site would breach resolutions from the United Nations Security Council.In 2018, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un made a promise to then-US president Donald Trump that North Korea would destroy all its nuclear material enrichment facilities.However, the UN's atomic agency says satellite images suggest that North Korea had restarted the reactor which makes its weapons-grade plutonium.The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has also said that North Korea's nuclear programme is going "full steam ahead," with work on plutonium separation, uranium enrichment and other activities.Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questions</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Nadine  Yousif"><Text>Former US President Donald Trump nearly fired his daughter and routinely flushed documents down the toilet.These explosive details and more are revealed in New York Times journalist Maggie Haberman's highly-anticipated book Confidence Man, which is released on Tuesday. The book follows Mr Trump from his time as a New York businessman to his life after the presidency. It draws from interviews with more than 200 sources, including former aides as well as three interviews with Mr Trump himself. The former president has attacked Haberman, writing on his social media platform that the book contains "many made up stories with zero fact checking".Here are eight of Confidence Man's biggest revelations:At a meeting with then Chief of Staff John Kelly and then White House counsel Don McGahn, Haberman writes that Mr Trump was close to tweeting that his daughter, Ivanka, and son-in-law Jared Kushner - both senior White House aides - were leaving their positions. He was stopped by Mr Kelly, who advised him to speak with Ivanka and Mr Kushner first before sending the tweet. Mr Trump never spoke with them, and they both remained White House aides until the end of his presidency. The book also reveals that Mr Trump frequently talked down on his son-in-law, and once commented that Mr Kushner "sounds like a child" after hearing a public speech he gave in 2017. Mr Trump has denied ever wanting to fire Ivanka and her husband. "Pure fiction. Never even crossed my mind," he said.Haberman writes that Mr Trump raised the prospect of bombing Mexican drug labs several times - a suggestion that stunned former US Defence Secretary Mark Esper. The idea stemmed from a conversation that Mr Trump had with Brett Giroir, a public health officer and an admiral with the US Public Health Service Commissioned Corps.Mr Giroir walked into the Oval Office wearing a dress uniform - as is customary for public health officers in the corps - and said to Mr Trump that facilities producing illegal drugs in Mexico should be handled by putting "a lead to target" to stop illicit substances from coming over the border.Mistaking Mr Giroir for a military officer, Mr Trump then suggested bombing the drug facilities. In response, the White House asked Mr Giroir to stop wearing his uniform. When Mr Trump fell ill with Covid-19 in October 2020, his condition at the White House was worsening and he was fearful of dying.  At one point, his deputy chief of staff, Tony Ornato, warned the president that if his health deteriorated further he would have to set in motion procedures to ensure the continuity of government. This fear existed despite several attempts by Mr Trump to minimize the pandemic, as he worried the virus was negatively impacting his image and political motivations. Haberman writes that he asked aides around him to take off their masks, and that he advised then New York governor Andrew Cuomo to not talk about the virus on TV. "Don't make such a big deal out of this," Mr Trump said to Mr Cuomo, according to the book. "You're going to make it a problem."Haberman's book details several encounters between Mr Trump and world leaders. For instance, in his first meeting with then UK Prime Minister Theresa May, Mr Trump spoke about abortion, saying "some people are pro-life, some people are pro-choice. Imagine if some animals with tattoos raped your daughter and she got pregnant?"He then changed the subject in a conversation on Northern Ireland to discuss how to block an offshore wind project from being set up near his property. When it became apparent that Mr Trump was losing the 2020 election to US President Joe Biden, he called former New York City mayor and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani."Okay, Rudy, you're in charge. Go wild, do anything you want. I don't care," Mr Trump said, after other lawyers refused to go as far as he has requested in his bid to overturn the election results. "My lawyers are terrible," he said to Mr Giuliani, according to the book. He also frequently berated White House counsel Pat Cipollone. The book reveals that at the time, Mr Trump was enamoured with conspiracy theories and sought out lawyers that his own advisers felt were deluded.On a plane while campaigning in 2016, Mr Trump was asked by his campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and his press secretary Hope Hicks to address his refusal to release his tax returns - an issue they saw as a problem for Mr Trump's White House bid.Haberman writes that Mr Trump responded by leaning back before snapping to a sudden thought: "Well, you know my taxes are under audit, I always get audited," he said. "So what I mean is, well I could just say, 'I'll release them when I'm no longer under audit. 'Cause I'll never not be under audit." Since Richard Nixon, every US president has voluntarily released their tax returns. A 2020 New York Times investigation has since revealed that Mr Trump paid $750 (£662) in federal income taxes the year he became president. When Mr Trump was in office, White House staff periodically discovered that the toilet was clogged with printed paper and believed he had flushed documents.He also allegedly tore up documents, which contravenes the Presidential Records Act - a law that says documents created or received by a president are the property of the US government and are to be handled by the US National Archives once the presidency ends.The details are revealed amid wider allegations of missing documents from Mr Trump's White House levelled by the National Archives. Mr Trump also faces a criminal investigation by the Department of Justice for keeping government records at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida after leaving office.At a congressional meeting shortly after his 2017 inauguration, Haberman writes that Mr Trump turned to a racially diverse group of Democratic staffers and asked them to fetch canapes, mistaking them for waiters.The book details that Mr Trump made the remarks to staffers for Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Nancy Pelosi. Haberman also documents a history of homophobic remarks allegedly uttered by Mr Trump. </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="BBC News, author unspecified"><Text>Four women have been selected to run the world's most remote post office and count penguins in Antarctica.Clare Ballantyne, Mairi Hilton, Natalie Corbett and Lucy Bruzzone beat a record number of applicants to become the team responsible for managing historic site Port Lockroy, on Goudier Island.The team will travel 9,000 miles from the UK to reopen the bay for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic.They will spend five months without running water or a flushing toilet.Newlywed Ms Corbett, in charge of running the gift shop at the site's museum, will leave behind her husband for the trip, which she dubbed a "solo honeymoon".The 31-year-old from Hampshire said she could not resist the opportunity to work on the island."Who wouldn't want to spend five months working on an island filled with penguins in one of the most remote places on the planet?" she said.As well as dealing with sub-zero temperatures and almost constant daylight, the women will share the island with a colony of gentoo penguins, which Ms Hilton will be in charge of monitoring."This will be my first time in Antarctica and I'm very excited to set eyes on the white continent. I have no idea what to expect when we get there - how cold it will be, will we have to dig our way through the snow to the post office?" Ms Hilton, from Bo'ness, near Falkirk in Scotland, said."I'm a conservation biologist, so personally I can't wait to see the penguins and other wildlife like seabirds and whales."The four women were among 6,000 people who expressed an interest in the roles, which were advertised by the UK Antarctic Heritage Trust (UKAHT) charity.Newly appointed postmaster Ms Ballantyne, from Lincolnshire, has just completed a masters in earth science at Oxford University.The 23-year-old will deal by hand with approximately 80,000 cards, which are mailed each year from the site to more than 100 countries.Ms Bruzzone will be base leader, managing the team and coordinating all ship visits to the island.The scientist, who has already spent three months in the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard on an Arctic expedition, described the opportunity as a "lifelong dream".The women will be joined for the first 10 weeks by 42-year-old Vicky Inglis, from Aberdeenshire, who was a UKAHT general assistant in the 2019/20 season.

It takes less than five minutes to get there, but the last 50 metres must be covered on foot through thick, spiky vegetation, some of it chest-high.  The two men flee as the unit approaches, leaving behind them the half-prepared boat, the fuel and motor, and two sacks of life-jackets."The vegetation works against us," General Frantz Tavart told me. "The smugglers know this and stash the boats here on purpose."The UK drones are valuable, he says, because they spot even well-hidden sites like this one."The drone caught this," he said. "The [surveillance] plane passed over beforehand and didn't spot it, because it was hidden by the trees."This 160km stretch of coastline has sucked in resources, year after year. France and the UK have invested in more patrols, better technology and different kinds of vehicles. And still the numbers crossing the Channel keep growing.Britain's new home secretary, Suella Braverman, will give a speech at the Conservative's party conference later where she's expected to restate her determination to crack down on the arrivals.French patrols say they're stopping around half of all crossing attempts, but more than 30,000 people have still made it to the UK so far this year.And it's not just migrants who are finding this route increasingly attractive. New smuggling networks have been reported this summer too.A senior French official with good knowledge of the situation told us that dedicated Albanian smuggling networks are now operating across the Channel, separately from the main Kurdish and Iraqi networks."[The Albanian networks] are more efficient than the others," he told us. "40% of those we intercept on this side of the Channel are Albanian; but they make up 60% of those who arrive on the other side.""Our hypothesis is that they're a lot more experienced than the others in terms of criminal activity, and more used to organising themselves and avoiding the police. We find the prices are higher for Albanian networks than for the others."General Tavart says he can't confirm whether the new Albanian smuggling routes are being run by established criminal groups, perhaps based in the UK, but he says it would make sense."With the price of a crossing around 4,000 euros (£3,482), and around 40 people in one boat, do the maths," he said.  "It's extremely lucrative, even more so than drug trafficking, and the criminal charges are lighter."Some have suggested that shortages in the labour market post-Brexit are adding to the 'pull-factors' attracting both smugglers and their clients.Larger numbers of Albanians have been seen at the main migrant camp in Dunkerque, but most seem to stay in hotels around the area, or in Paris or Brussels.At one hotel in Dunkerque, the landlady confirmed she now had a large number of Albanian clients passing through.  The owner of a bar across the street from the station said that on some days half his customers are Albanian."I wonder if there's anyone left in Albania," he said, "seeing how many of them are coming through here."The rise in migrants crossing the Channel, and the appearance of new smuggling networks, seems to challenge the government's strategy of deterrence.For months, the UK government has been promising to send some of those who arrive in small boats to Rwanda, where their asylum claims will be processed, and where they will be expected to settle if their claim is successful.On the road outside Calais, in the small hours of the morning, we met 17-year-old Sikunder and his friends, wrapped in survival blankets that glinted like pieces of silver in the dark.They are all from Afghanistan, they said, and had just been rescued from a sinking boat by the French police.I asked Sikunder whether he was aware that the UK might send him to Rwanda."I have heard about it," he replied, "but some of my relatives in the UK told us the plan was finished, and we can come to the UK."It was his second attempt at crossing; he's determined it won't be his last.The UK government is currently fighting a court battle over the legality of its Rwanda policy. In the camps around Calais, almost everyone is aware of the risk, and almost everyone finds a way to rationalise it away.Biniam is a softly-spoken 28-year-old man from the Tigray region in Ethiopia. In fluent English, he told me he had a Masters degree in manufacturing, and that he wanted to claim asylum in the UK because he had seen how the British government had spoken out strongly against the violent conflict in Tigray."The UK understands the situation in my country," he told me. "So that's why I will go."I ask him how afraid he is of being sent to Rwanda."100% afraid," he said. "If they return me to Africa, it will be easy for the government of Ethiopia to take me."More than one person here told me how the change of prime minister would mean the policy would be scrapped.There's little sign of that UK Prime Minister Liz Truss has so far been very supportive of it.Jess Sharman of Care4Calais says people are risking their lives to get to the UK, because they can't claim asylum while in France, and can't cross the Channel via official routes."They shouldn't be here, and it's only because of government policies that they are," she said. "And that could change overnight if Liz Truss could make it safe and legal for them to [claim asylum]."A lot can change overnight here in Calais.Camps are systematically destroyed by police units; violent conflicts erupt between smuggling gangs; security patrols race migrants for miles along the scrubby coastline; and - very often - as dawn breaks, another boatload of people from around the world end up on Britain's shores.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Rajini Vaidyanathan"><Text>The United Nations has issued a new appeal for more than $800m (£700m) for flood-hit Pakistan. The funds, a five-fold increase on the previous request, would help families and children battle malnutrition and infection in what is now a public health emergency. It comes as the country struggles to cope after more than 2,000 hospitals and health centres were damaged or destroyed in recent floods, which left almost 1,700 people dead. Doctors like Ammara Gohar are on the front lines of the crisis as the UN launches a fresh appeal for the world to send more aid."It's very difficult for us. We attended to patients during Covid, but this is tougher because it involves environmental hazards," says Dr Ammara, a gynaecologist four years into her medical career.  She is working out of a school in rural Sindh province, the area worst affected in the floods, which has temporarily become the headquarters for the district health office after it was submerged. Here, Dr Ammara and her team load a van with boxes of medical supplies - everything from bandages to malaria tablets, hepatitis test kits to oral rehydration salts."We're taking this to people who've been completely cut off since the floods," she explains. Pakistan flood survivors battle rising tide of diseasePakistan floods: Images show huge scale of devastationWith around 75% of districts in Sindh province still flooded - and many roads underwater -  the only way people in isolated communities can access medical help is if it travels to them.So after an hour's drive, we reach the banks of a huge lake which a few months ago was fertile land that fed people in this area. Having swallowed their crops, it's now stagnant water where mosquitoes multiply, and a breeding ground for disease.Across the vast expanse live villagers who've been stranded for weeks."These people cannot survive without support in disaster-hit areas," Dr Ammara tells us.Her team of government doctors take to wooden boats to reach them, their efforts supported by the United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef). "This is a medical crisis," Unicef's Aadarsh Laghari tells us, as the medical team headed to a village needing help. "Access is one of the biggest problems - every day the medical needs of these communities are rising."In the first three weeks of September alone, more than 140,000 cases of malaria were reported in Sindh, health officials say. But with many people in far-flung areas unable to get tested, it's likely the true scale is much higher.And that's why mobile medical units are so urgently needed.After we reach the shore, the team set up a health camp under the shade of a tree on the edge of the village, where cows had earlier been taking shelter from the sun.A banner is hung from the branches to advertise the clinic; supplies which had been carried here by land and by water, are now being unpacked and laid out on plastic tables.As a tannoy announces the arrival of the medical staff, a steady stream of villagers arrive, many of them women carrying young children. The village of Noor Shah was already impoverished but the floods have pushed people right to the edge.As patients line up, a nurse measures the arm of baby Saima, with Dr Ammara looking on. The tape wound around her tiny arm moves to the red area of the scale, indicating that Saima is perilously thin."There are so many people like this baby," Dr Ammara says. "At just nine months old she's severely malnourished."Many families are sleeping in the open in flimsy tents next to homes which were washed away, or have crumbled to rock.Marooned for weeks, they're finally getting much needed medical help - but many say they're still waiting to get food and access to clean water to drink and wash with.At another village close by, three-year-old Gulbahar is examined by Dr Ammara. He has scabs on his face and body and is weak -  the result, Dr Ammara says, of drinking and washing with contaminated water.The UN says a lack of toilets has left people with no choice but to defecate in the same water, leading to outbreaks of illnesses. "Because of the floods we are seeing so many young children with these skin infections," Dr Ammara says, opening Gulbahar's mouth to examine his diseased gums.She hands his mother some medicines, but concedes her supplies will soon run out.While diseases spike, Pakistan's already overwhelmed healthcare system lacks the resources to help all those who need treatment. Boats are also in short supply, as are doctors - meaning efforts like this remain limited.Many people we met in these remote communities blame the government for not doing enough. Dr Azra Afzal Pechuho, the Sindh health minister, said: "It's like fighting a war which has no end to it. Until the water recedes, which is going to take another two, three months, we will still be seeing a lot of health issues."She has called for doctors to volunteer extra hours. "Ten days, three days, four days - whatever they feel they can give to the flood-affected areas," she told the BBC.Dr Ammara and her team are already working around the clock.  Without the camps, Dr Ammara fears people won't be able to survive."It hurts, it really hurts, I can't see people like this," she says. "I feel bad that we can't do more."</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Nduka Orjinmo"><Text>Jane Toku sheds no tears as she recalls the moment when she saw the smouldering remains of her son's corpse on the morning he and three of his friends were lynched 10 years ago.The four students had run into a local vigilante group at dawn in Aluu, a community behind the University of Port Harcourt in southern Nigeria's oil capital.There had been a spate of robberies in the area and at that time of the morning, people became suspicions. Accused of being petty thieves, the four - Llody Toku, Ugonna Obuzor, Chiadika Biringa and Tekena Elkanah - were given a mock trial and found guilty.Their punishment was handed out immediately: they were stripped, marched around the community, brutally beaten and set alight by the mob as thousands watched and filmed."When I arrived, I forced my way through the crowd and knelt before my son's corpse."His friend Tekena was barely breathing, I watched his chest heave with his last breaths," Mrs Toku said.Such mob killings are not uncommon in Nigeria but this was the first to go viral on social media, causing widespread outrage, protests and debates about the country's judicial system, and questions about a society where people resort to such levels of violence."One is tired and sick of coming here to lament after these dastardly acts," a lawmaker said at the time when the incident was discussed at the National Assembly."It is important for 'jungle justice' to be stopped - it is bad," said radio host Yaw, as celebrities condemned the incident.But despite the shock and anger over the killing of the students, now known as the Aluu Four, and the sentencing of three men including one police officer, for their roles in the lynching, mob attacks continue to happen in Nigeria. There have been 391 mob killings in Nigeria since 2019, according to SBM Intelligence, a Lagos-based think-tank, with at least five this year alone. That begs the question why the outrage over the killing of the Aluu Four didn't lead to a national reckoning over lynchings."The failure of the criminal justice system is one very important reason for this," said Dr Agwanwo Destiny, a criminologist at the sociology department of the University of Port Harcourt.He pointed to instances where criminal suspects handed over to the police were released without investigation and ended up seeking revenge on those who had given them up."Such incidents erode trust in the judicial system, so when people are alleged to have committed a crime, people are quick to pass judgement and vent their frustrations," Dr Destiny said.It is an argument also made by activist Annkio Briggs, who led demonstrations in Port Harcourt to demand justice for the students and their families, because she "couldn't trust the system to do what was right," she told the BBC.Perpetrators of mob killings in Nigeria are rarely arrested and prosecuted.Two suspects arrested in May after the lynching of a Christian student on allegations of blasphemy in Sokoto have still not been brought to trial, while the police said the main culprits are still at large.It was one of four reported cases of mob killing in that month alone:Two men were burnt to death by a mob in the Ijesha area of Lagos over alleged theft of mobile phonesOne man was murdered in Lugbe, Abuja on allegations of blasphemyCommercial motorcyclists lynched a sound engineer identified as David Imoh in the Lekki area of Lagos.Suspects have been charged in all cases, the police said. But it might be years before there are any verdicts because of the slow pace of justice in Nigeria.Two years ago, Nigeria's anti-corruption agency, the ICPC, said the judiciary was the most corrupt arm of government in the country. It said that more than nine billion naira ($21m; £19m) was offered and paid as bribes in the sector. Such reports indicating that justice is for sale to the highest bidder erode trust in the system, said Dr Destiny.It has never been determined what the four students were doing when they were stopped by the vigilante group in Aluu.One version said they were thieves, another said they were members of a violent gang but neither allegation was proved in court."He was not a perfect child but he was humble and he was our confidant."He was close to us because we had our second child 11 years after him," Mrs Toku said of her son.The four students, best friends, were in their late teens and early 20s and came from middle-class homes.Ugonna, 18, and his friend Lloyd, 19 - known as Tipsy and Big L - were budding musicians in Port Harcourt's rap scene.One of their three unreleased songs Love In The City could almost be a prophesy of what befell them.Growing up in the city like PH where Ra was made to sing rightWe embrace the street life cosThere's no love in the heart of the cityHow can the seeds grow when the garden is wearyIt used to be very cool but the oil crude brought violence"There can be no justification, no reason why anybody should die like that," said their friend Gloria During, who lived in the same Hilton hostel in Aluu as both musicians.Aluu is popular for its private apartments that are rented by students who can't find accommodation at the university's insufficient hostels.At the time it was a small village with many undeveloped plots and a population that were mostly farmers. Today, Port Harcourt's sprawling metropolis has caught up with the fringes of Aluu - most of the land has been built on by Pentecostal churches and more hostels have sprung up.But in the centre of the community remains two barren plots, the playground where the students were first held and death pronounced on them, and the burrow-pit, several hundred yards away, where they were marched to, beaten and killed.Despite the nationwide shock when the incident happened, time has allowed most of Nigeria to move on.But for a mother, time is a keen reminder of the loss of a beloved first son with a bright future ahead of him. "He had a bright career in music, he would have gone far by now," Mrs Toku said. </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="BBC News, author unspecified"><Text>Celebrated Indian filmmaker Mani Ratnam's new film Ponniyin Selvan:1, a Tamil-language epic period drama, has taken the box office by storm. Sudha G Tilak on what makes the film a hit.Ponniyin Selvan, based on one of India's greatest emperors, is widely considered by many to be the finest novel ever written in Tamil.It was the name conferred by the loyal subjects on Rajaraja Chola - whose name means 'king of kings' -  of the Chola dynasty, which ruled Tamil land from 9th Century to 13th Century.Rajaraja was not the first of the Chola dynasty but he took their empire to its zenith - from a relatively small kingdom to the dominant empire in India. Their political influence extended across Sri Lanka, Maldives, Sumatra, parts of Thailand and Malaysia, and they had diplomatic ties with China.Rajaraja Chola: Cults of the ImaginationVenice film award for director Mani RatnamHistorian Sunil Khilnani wrote that Rajaraja "pulled off something that no Indian ruler before him seems to have done: he'd commandeered trading boats, timber sailed craft and launched maritime expeditions, bringing far flung wealth back home". The star-studded film, which cost $70m (£62m) to make, revolves around Ponniyin Selvan's ascendency to the throne as his father, the ailing king, retreats from royal duties. The kingdom is embroiled in palace intrigues and an impending coup. Rival members of the royal clan plot to usurp the throne, and enemy kings conspire assassinations. Leading the stratagem is a powerful and enigmatic noblewoman Nandini (played by Bollywood star Aishwarya Rai Bachchan) on a vengeful path to destroy her former lover and the prince-in-waiting (played by award-winning actor Vikram). Her rival is princess Kundavai (played by leading Tamil actress Trisha) who wants to defeat the plots, protect her brothers, and see that her rightful sibling ascends the throne. Row over Bollywood director in Indian Big BrotherActor Karthi plays the part of the colourful Vandiyathevan, a swashbuckling warrior and loyal friend of the princes. He is a musketeer-like figure, charming women, averting disasters, and thwarting plots with clever antics.  Ponniyin Selvan is a fictional literary record of the glory of the Cholas, whose cultural contribution remains visible in modern-day Tamil Nadu. The king's imprint can be seen in the stunning sculptures and inscriptions in a towering granite temple in the city of Thanjavur, which was the seat of the Cholas. The story of Ponniyin Selvan was serialised in Kalki, a Tamil magazine, by writer and journalist Kalki Krishnamurthy in 1955. The sprawling historical fiction, running to nearly 2,000 pages, has been published in several editions and translated into English. Comic books for children based on the novel and theatre productions have kept the epic alive in popular imagination."The novel has a cult following across generations of Tamils. It will be interesting to see how a 21st-Century audience reared on Game of Thrones and homegrown fantasy movies like Baahubali responds to this film based on 10th Century dynastic Tamil politics, royal intrigue, and chicanery," says Chennai-based film scholar Pritam Chakravarthy.Director Mani Ratnam, described as "India's top pop-film auteur", said in an interview that he wanted Ponniyin Selvan to be an "immersive experience" for the audience.Why Bollywood is struggling to beat pandemic bluesThe south Indian films winning on Bollywood's turfScenes of bloody battles and warring soldiers, horseback and elephant chases and dances with actors in regalia captivate audiences. A beachfront invasion, the king battling the savage seas and the sinking of a ship are a nod to the maritime escapades of the Cholas. The dialogue is in medieval Tamil, but written to be accessible to a contemporary audience.  The film's music, a blend of Western chords, folk drum beats, monkey chants and Sufi strains is led by Oscar-winning composer AR Rahman.Critics have appreciated Mani Ratnam for his deft adaptation of a five-part novel into two parts - the second part is due for release next year. Despite the pandemic, the director managed to wrap up filming both the parts of the movie, each running to nearly two-and-a-half hours, in 150 days.Ponniyin Selvan opened to a thunderous reception at the weekend. Cinema halls in the southern city of Chennai saw people queue up for special shows that opened after midnight to accommodate the huge volume of ticket sales. Scenes of fans dancing to folk drumbeats outside cinema halls celebrating the release of the movie were seen across Tamil Nadu.'Struggling' Bollywood's online hate problemThe frenzy over the film has spilled over with fans forming groups to travel across the former kingdoms and villages across Tamil Nadu ruled by the Cholas as mentioned in the novel. The first part ends with a cliff-hanger.

The former officer, aged 34, was sacked in June for drug use, police said.A teacher who survived told Thailand's Thairath TV that the attacker used to drop off his child at the nursery and had seemed polite. A motive remains unclear.At least 22 children were among the dead in the mass killing in the town of Utthai Sawan. Some victims aged as young as two were attacked as they slept. A dozen people who were injured have been taken to Nong Bua Lamphu district hospital.Follow our live coverage"The shooter came in around lunchtime and shot four or five officials at the childcare centre first," a local official, Jidapa Boonsom, who was working nearby, told Reuters news agency. One of them was a teacher who was eight months pregnant."At first people thought it was fireworks," she said, adding that the man then forced entry to a locked room where children were sleeping.'It's shocking' - witnesses describe nursery attack horrorVideos shared on social media appear to show the tears and distress of parents and relatives of those killed, as they gathered at a shelter outside the centre.Police officers arriving after the attack were confronted with horrific scenes, the bodies of adults and children, some of them very young, lying inside and outside the building. Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha described the incident as "a shocking event".Police named the attacker as Panya Kamrab, a local man who had been a police lieutenant colonel before he was dismissed last year for drug use. He is understood to have appeared in court on Thursday on charges related to the use and possible sale of methamphetamine. The verdict was scheduled to be delivered on Friday.Armed with a shotgun, a pistol and a knife, he stormed the nursery at about 12:30 local time (05:30 GMT). The details of what followed are still emerging, but after the killing spree the attacker fled the scene in a white four-door Toyota pick-up truck with Bangkok registration plates, according to police, who launched a search for him and warned locals to keep indoors for their own safety. Eyewitnesses were quoted saying the attacker had driven into bystanders and opened fire at some of them, injuring several people as he made his escape.The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterPolice say Kamrab returned home, killing his wife and son before taking his own life.Mass shootings in Thailand are rare, although gun ownership rates are relatively high for the region. Illegal weapons are also common in the south-east Asian country, according to the Reuters news agency.

Her uncle was also seen on TV speaking against the unrest, as someone seems to whisper to him: "Say it, you scumbag!"The source told BBC Persian that these were both "forced confessions" that came "after intense interrogations and being threatened that other family members would be killed".Atash and Nika's uncle, Mohsen, were detained by authorities after Atash posted messages online about her niece's death and spoke to the media. The televised statements were recorded before they were released, according to the source.The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterAtash told BBC Persian prior to her arrest on Sunday that the Revolutionary Guards had told her that Nika was in their custody for five days and then handed over to prison authorities.The judiciary has said that on the night she disappeared Nika went into a building where eight constructions workers were present, and that she was found dead in the yard outside the next morning.Tehran judiciary official Mohammad Shahriari was cited by state media as saying on Wednesday that a post-mortem showed Nika suffered "multiple fractures... in the pelvis, head, upper and lower limbs, arms and legs, which indicate that the person was thrown from a height".He declared that this proved her death was nothing to do with the protests. However, a death certificate issued by a cemetery in the capital, which was obtained by BBC Persian, states that she died after suffering "multiple injuries caused by blows with a hard object".Nika's Instagram and Telegram accounts were also deleted after she went missing, according to Atash. Iranian security forces are known to demand that detainees give them access to the social media accounts so that the accounts or certain posts can be deleted.Wednesday night's state TV report also featured footage in which Atash was seen confirming that her niece's body was found outside the building mentioned by the judiciary, even though that contradicted previous statements made by her and other members of the family.The family have said they located Nika's body at the mortuary of a detention centre 10 days after she went missing, and that they were only allowed by officials to see her face for a few seconds in order to identify her. Atash said before she was detained that she did not go to the mortuary.Nika's family transferred her body to her father's hometown of Khorramabad, in the west of the country, on Sunday - on what would have been her 17th birthday.A source close to them told BBC Persian that the family agreed, under duress from authorities, not to hold a public funeral. But, the source said, security forces then "stole" Nika's body from Khorramabad and secretly buried it in the village of Veysian, about 40km (25 miles) away.Hundreds of protesters later gathered in Khorramabad's cemetery and chanted slogans against the government, including "death to the dictator" - a reference to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei.Nika is not the only young female protester to have been killed during the unrest that erupted last month following the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman who was detained by the morality police for allegedly violating the Islamic Republic's strict hijab law.The family of Hadis Najafi, 22, have said that she was shot dead by security forces while protesting in the city of Karaj, west of Tehran, on 21 September. Officials allegedly asked her father to say that she died of a heart attack.Another 16-year-old girl, Sarina Esmailzadeh, died after being severely beaten on the head with batons by security forces during protests in Karaj on 23 September, Amnesty International cited a source as saying. The source also told the human rights group that security and intelligence agents had harassed the girl's family to coerce them into silence.  Several videos made by Sarina before her death have now been posted on social media. In one recorded after finishing some school exams, she says: "Nothing feels better than freedom."  </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Paul Kirby"><Text>At least 17 people have died and another 15 people are missing after a migrant boat sank off the Greek island of Lesbos on Wednesday night.The Greek coastguard said the dinghy had left the Turkish coast carrying 40 people in very high winds.Elsewhere in Greece dozens of migrants were rescued when their boat hit rocks near the southern island of Kythira.Coastguard video showed a group of people trapped beneath a cliff as rescuers pulled them to safety.Both boats went down within hours of each other on Wednesday night and early on Thursday, hundreds of kilometres apart.Volunteers joined rescue officials at the top of the cliff face on Kythira, an island off the Peloponnese region of southern Greece. The migrant boat broke up close to the island's eastern harbour at Diakofti in winds of up to 70km/h (45mph) and according to Greek reports one of those on board raised the alarm when it got into trouble."We could see the boat smashing against the rocks and people climbing up those rocks to try and save themselves," local resident Martha Stathaki told the Associated Press news agency. Eighty of the 95 people on board are said to have been rescued on the Kythira coast. Greek reports say they had originally come from Iran, Afghanistan and Iraq and included 55 men and 18 children.Mayor Stratos Harhalakis said the boat had arrived at the worst possible point on Kythira as a gale-force winds pushed  it on to treacherous rocks. He described seeing five people drown as they were swept away. Their small boat was big enough for 15 to 20 people, rather than almost 100, he said. Meanwhile, on Lesbos, authorities said the bodies of 16 young women of African origin and a young boy had been recovered after their boat went down near Thermi. Ten women were rescued and taken to the local hospital at Mytilini. Lesbos was also hit by powerful winds as the coastguard searched for survivors.Local officials said the boat had left the Turkish port of Ayvali and Greek Migration Minister Notis Mitarachi called on Turkey to take "immediate action" to put an end to irregular migrant crossings in harsh weather. "Already today many lives lost in the Aegean, people are drowning in unseaworthy vessels. EU must act," he tweeted.While Lesbos is a short distance from the coast of western Turkey, Kythira lies some 400km (250km) west of Turkey's coastline on the Aegean Sea and is on what has become known as the smugglers' "Calabrian" route, named after their destination in southern Italy.Last month two migrant boats landed on Kythira carrying almost 100 people, mainly from Afghanistan. More and more crossings are being made from Turkey to the Italian coast, bypassing Greece.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Helen Bushby and Ian Youngs"><Text>French writer Annie Ernaux has won the Nobel Prize in Literature, for what the panel said was an "uncompromising" 50-year body of work exploring "a life marked by great disparities regarding gender, language and class".The prestigious accolade is awarded by the Swedish Academy and is worth 10 million Swedish kronor (£807,000).She said it was "a great honour".Professor Carl-Henrik Heldin, chair of the committee, said the 82-year-old's work was "admirable and enduring".He said she used "courage and clinical acuity" to tell semi-autobiographical stories that uncover "the contradictions of social experience [and] describe shame, humiliation, jealousy or the inability to see who you are".The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterHer books, including A Man's Place and A Woman's Story, are considered to be contemporary classics in France.Ernaux is the first French woman to win the literature prize, and told Swedish broadcaster SVT it was "a responsibility"."I was very surprised... I never thought it would be on my landscape as a writer," she said. "It is a great responsibility... to testify, not necessarily in terms of my writing, but to testify with accuracy and justice in relation to the world."Jacques Testard, from Fitzcarraldo Editions which publishes English translations of her work, told BBC World Service Radio's Newshour she is an "exceptional and unique" writer. "She's a very important feminist writer, I would say, also a very important working class writer - both of those themes I think very clearly visible in her work," he explained. Dr Ruth Cruickshank, who specialises in contemporary French fiction at Royal Holloway, University of London, said: "When a woman wins the Nobel Prize for Literature it is always great news. Thirteen dead and two living white French men have been Nobel laureates since 1901."She explores memories of life experiences - both extraordinary and relatable - a backstreet abortion; failed affairs whether with a lover in Russia or a man 30 years younger; the death of her parents; breast cancer."Ernaux was born in 1940 in Normandy, where the setting for her early life was "poor but ambitious", Prof Heldin said.Her parents ran a café and grocery shop, and when she encountered girls from middle-class backgrounds, she experienced the "shame of her working-class parents and milieu for the first time," according to her website.That would later feed into her novels. Her official biography said the main themes of her work were "the body and sexuality; intimate relationships; social inequality and the experience of changing class through education; time and memory; and the overarching question of how to write these life experiences".Ernaux studied literature, having worked as an au pair in London, and was married with two children and teaching in a French secondary school when her first book was published in 1974.Cleaned Out was a fictionalised account of the illegal abortion she had in 1964, which she kept secret from her family.She revisited that trauma 25 years later for the book Happening, in which she "sifts through her memories and her journal entries dating from those days". It was turned into a film that won the top prize at last year's Venice Film Festival.Prof Heldin added: "Annie Ernaux manifestly believes in the liberating force of writing. Her work is uncompromising and written in plain language, scraped clean."The writer got divorced in the early 1980s, and in 2000 she retired from teaching to devote herself to writing.Another of Ernaux's books, The Years, won the Prix Renaudot in France in 2008 and the Premio Strega in Italy in 2016, while a year later she won the Marguerite Yourcenar Prize for her life's work.In 2019, The Years went on to be shortlisted for the Man Booker International Prize, whose judges called it a "genre-bending masterpiece".Booker said at the time that "autobiography is given a new form, at once subjective and impersonal, private and collective".The New Yorker wrote in 2020 that over her 20 books, "she has been devoted to a single task: the excavation of her own life".The Nobel Prizes, awarded since 1901, recognise achievement in literature, science, peace and latterly economics. Last year's literary prize was won by Tanzanian novelist Abdulrazak Gurnah.Other winners have included novelists such as Ernest Hemingway, Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Toni Morrison, plus poets such as Louise Gluck, Pablo Neruda, Joseph Brodsky and Rabindranath Tagore, and playwrights including Harold Pinter and Eugene O'Neill.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Jessica Parker"><Text>The leaders of more than 40 European countries are having talks in Prague, at a historic first meeting of a new political forum of nations.As he arrived, France's Emmanuel Macron spoke of building a "common strategy" in response to Russia's war in Ukraine.UK Prime Minister Liz Truss joined leaders from the EU, Turkey, Norway and the Balkans, as Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky spoke via video link.Germany's chancellor said the gathering was a great innovation.The summit, billed as a European Political Community beyond the EU, has been championed by Emmanuel Macron, who told reporters on Thursday it sent a "message of unity". But there is scepticism, even within the EU, about the new forum. Ahead of the meeting, Ms Truss made clear it was "not an EU construct or an EU alternative". Nevertheless, her decision to take part could mark a new phase in the UK's post-Brexit relations with Europe. The leaders were discussing energy, migration and security, with a particular focus on the war in Ukraine. Officials said Ms Truss spoke of the need for stronger, more resilient economies and energy supplies, while stressing the need for freedom to succeed.Ukraine's president told the summit: "You and I are now in a strong position to direct all the possible might of Europe to end the war and guarantee long-term peace for Ukraine, for Europe, for the world."EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said in a blog that in the wake of Russia's invasion, there was a need to "rethink and reform the wider European order, beyond the work of the EU and Nato", but he added that the summit would be no more than an initial exchange.As well as the UK, non-EU members Switzerland, Turkey, Norway, Iceland, Georgia, Azerbaijan and western Balkan countries are among those taking part in the first gathering of the EPC.Germany's Olaf Scholz pointed out that all the countries attending the summit knew that Russia's war was "a brutal violation of the security and peace order that we have had in Europe over recent decades".Critics see it as a vague regurgitation of old ideas and its exact role has yet to be made clear. When he proposed the idea this year, President Macron said it would "offer a platform for political co-ordination" for countries, both those in the EU and those not. Russia's invasion of Ukraine gave new impetus for co-operation among nations beyond the EU's 27 member states. What is the new European Political Community?Truss pledges billions to support Ukraine in 2023But the new EPC has no institutions or dedicated staff. That has led to questions about how any decisions would be implemented. So it's an unprecedented effort to bring leaders together from across the continent to discuss areas of shared interest. If it proves to be a success, it may continue to take place up to twice a year. If it's a failure, it could fizzle out.Ms Truss had been hostile to the EPC project, so what changed?Some observers point out it was never likely she would voice passionate enthusiasm for a French-led European meet-up while vying for the Tory leadership.But once in power, she appeared to warm to the idea, although Downing Street is reluctant to accept suggestions that Mr Macron won her over.It might prove to be a "modest" turning point in EU-UK relations, says the director of the Centre for European Reform, Charles Grant.While a row about post-Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland remains unresolved, talks are restarting this week."Neither side is trying to push that issue to the brink at the moment," says Mr Grant. "So this summit could be a sign of a modest rapprochement."The official line was that the PM was taking part because she wanted to "shore up" support for Ukraine and "galvanise" collective action on energy security and migration.Downing Street said Ms Truss would call on leaders to keep oil and gas interconnectors open this winter while taking part in talks on joint projects to develop new nuclear and offshore wind capacity.Another draw for the UK was the presence of Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan, as well as the participation of Norway, a key supplier of energy to the UK.The UK has been less keen to talk about security, with jitters that the EPC could be seen as somehow cutting across the Nato military alliance.If the EPC does prove short on solid outcomes, then expect it to be long on messages about support for Ukraine and condemnation of the Kremlin.But not all those attending are of one mind on the conflict."One of the measures of success will be, does it persuade Serbia, Azerbaijan and Turkey to lean a bit more to the West and less towards Russia?" says Mr Grant.Turkey has talked of a "balanced" approach to Russia and has not signed up to Western sanctions."When first proposed by Macron, the EPC was supposed to be a club with shared democratic values, but it's now more about making sure Europe as a whole isn't Russia's friend," says Mr Grant.A sign of the uncertainty about what the EPC is really for is that there have been far clearer messages about what it is not.It's not a substitute for Nato or the G7, we're told. It's not a slightly comfier "waiting room" for countries eager to join the EU. Nor it is a forum that will be dominated by EU institutions.That's despite invites having been issued by the president of the European Council, Charles Michel, while the meeting itself has been tacked on to the front of an EU summit.Brussels insists it has merely been facilitating the forum - it's not "the EU plus plus", insisted one senior official.The next EPC, in either six months or a year's time, is likely to be held in Moldova.If the project survives, the UK is currently fourth in line to host a summit. But British officials are keen to play it cool on the EPC, insisting they will walk away if it evolves in an undesirable direction.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="BBC News, author unspecified"><Text>Oscar-winning actor Kevin Spacey has gone on trial in New York over an allegation he sexually assaulted a boy 36 years ago.Mr Spacey is facing a civil lawsuit brought by Anthony Rapp, who says the actor inappropriately touched him at a party in 1986 when he was aged 14.Mr Spacey, 63, is separately facing five charges of sexual assault in the UK.The House of Cards actor has denied the allegations against him. Both Mr Rapp, now 51 and also an actor, and Mr Spacey were in the Manhattan federal courthouse when the trial opened with jury selection on Thursday.Mr Rapp says that Mr Spacey was around 26 or 27 years old when he met him at a party at his Manhattan apartment. In a Buzzfeed article from October 2017, Mr Rapp said that Mr Spacey had picked him up, placed him on a bed and lay down partially on top of him."I was aware that he was trying to get with me sexually," Mr Rapp said.His lawsuit says the alleged encounter lasted no more than two minutes and "there was no kissing, no undressing, no reaching under clothes, and no sexualized statements or innuendo".The legal action was filed in September 2020 and accuses Mr Spacey - whose real name is Kevin Spacey Fowler - of battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress.Mr Rapp is reportedly seeking $40m (£35m) in damages.The judge assigned to the case, Lewis A Kaplan, previously dismissed a charge of sexual assault, ruling the statute of limitations had expired. One day after the Buzzfeed article was posted five years ago, Mr Spacey took to social media to say he had no memory of what Mr Rapp described. "If I did behave then as he describes, I owe him the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior," he wrote."And I am sorry for the feelings he describes having carried with him all these years."In a video deposition he filmed with lawyers in January, Mr Spacey denied that the incident ever took place, according to news website Law &amp; Crime.  Mr Rapp's account "couldn't have been true", he said, because "I am not interested in boys and I do not touch people inappropriately".Mr Rapp stars in Star Trek: Discovery on Paramount+ and was previously in the Broadway musical Rent. Separate sex assault charges - alleging that Mr Spacey groped an 18-year-old at a restaurant in Nantucket, Massachusetts, in 2016 - collapsed in 2019 after the actor's lawyers argued the accuser had manipulated text messages on his phone.In August, a judge ruled that Spacey must pay $31m to the producers of House of Cards for the costs they incurred after firing him from the show. In July, he entered a not guilty plea in London to criminal charges of sexually assaulting three men over a decade ago. That trial is due to begin in June 2023.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="BBC News, author unspecified"><Text>A global alert has been issued over four cough syrups after the World Health Organization (WHO) warned they could be linked to the deaths of 66 children in The Gambia. The syrups have been "potentially linked with acute kidney injuries and 66 deaths among children", it said. The products were manufactured by an Indian company, Maiden Pharmaceuticals, which had failed to provide guarantees about their safety, the WHO added.The firm has not yet commented.The BBC has contacted Maiden Pharmaceuticals for comment.Indian officials say they have asked the WHO to share evidence of the link between the syrups and the deaths.The WHO identified the medicines as Promethazine Oral Solution, Kofexmalin Baby Cough Syrup, Makoff Baby Cough Syrup and Magrip N Cold Syrup. The four products had been identified in The Gambia, but "may have been distributed, through informal markets, to other countries or regions", the WHO added, in the alert published on its website.It warned that their use may result in serious injury or death, especially among children.The WHO's intervention came after medical authorities in The Gambia - a popular tourist destination - detected an increase in cases of acute kidney injury among children under the age of five in late July.The Gambia's government has since suspended the use of all paracetamol syrups and has urged people to use tablets instead.The number of deaths has declined since the ban but two more have been recorded in the past two weeks, Gambia health services director Mustapha Bittay told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme.He said that The Gambia did not currently have a laboratory capable of testing whether medicines were safe and so they had to be sent abroad for checking. Mr Bittay added that The Gambia was in discussions with the World Bank to get funding for a quality-control laboratory.The WHO said that laboratory analysis of samples of the products "confirms that they contain unacceptable amounts of diethylene glycol and ethylene glycol as contaminants".The substances were toxic, and their effects "can include abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhoea, inability to pass urine, headache, altered mental state and acute kidney injury which may lead to death," it added. Mr Bittay also said that traces had also been found of E.Coli, a bacteria which can cause diarrhoea and vomiting.The Gambia's health officials said last month that dozens of children had died, without giving an exact number.Speaking in Geneva on Wednesday, WHO chief Tedros Ghebreyesus said: "The loss of these young lives is beyond heart-breaking for their families." The WHO said that India's Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation indicated that the manufacturer may have only supplied the contaminated medications to The Gambia, AFP news agency reports, quoting an email from the UN health agency.But the WHO said that "global exposure" was possible as the "manufacturer may have used the same contaminated material in other products and distributed them locally or exported" them, the agency reports. </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Alex Therrien"><Text>A top chess player accused of cheating has insisted he is "not going to back down" after making his first comments on the scandal in nearly a month.On Tuesday, a Chess.com investigation claimed it was "likely" Hans Niemann cheated in more than 100 games online.The 19-year-old American rising star had already been accused of cheating by world champion Magnus Carlsen.Speaking on Wednesday after winning his US Championship game, Niemann said his victory was "a message to everyone". In a news conference following a convincing win against 15-year-old grandmaster Christopher Yoo, Niemann was asked about the "elephant in the room" - a reference to the cheating scandal that has gripped the chess world.Without addressing the allegations directly, Niemann said: "This game is a message to everyone. This entire thing started with me saying 'chess speaks for itself' and I think this game spoke for itself and showed the chess player I am. "It also showed I'm not going to back down and I'm going to play my best chess here regardless of the pressure."Niemann then cut the interview short after less than 60 seconds.The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on Twitter"You can leave it to your own interpretation, but thank you, that's it", he said when the interviewer tried to ask more questions."That's all I can say, because it was such a beautiful game I don't even need to describe it," he concluded.  Niemann, who was playing in the first round of the US Championship in St Louis, then walked out of the interview, prompting commentator Yasser Seirawan to laugh and say: "What? That's it? Ok." Until the interview Niemann had not spoken about the scandal since 7 September when he admitted to cheating in informal games when he was younger but strenuously denied doing so in competitive games.Niemann added that he was willing to play naked to prove his innocence and accused Carlsen and Chess.com of trying to ruin his career. The cheating row that's blowing up the chess worldWorld's top chess player accuses opponent of cheatingChess player 'likely cheated' in 100 games - reportThe scandal began last month after 31-year-old Carlsen, considered by many to be the greatest player of all time, was defeated by Niemann at the Sinquefield Cup in a major upset. The Norwegian made veiled accusations of cheating against Niemann at the time before openly accusing him last week. Then on Tuesday, a Chess.com investigation claimed it was likely Niemann had cheated "much more often" than he had admitted to, including in prize money events and against highly-rated "well known" figures in the game. Chess.com also noted "anomalies" in Niemann's rate of improvement, which has seen him soar up the rankings in classical chess from around 800 in the world to the top 50 in less than two years.The site said this rise was the fastest in "modern recorded history" and had occurred "much later in life than his peers".But it found no evidence he had cheated in his game against Carlsen or in any other over-the-board games.A separate statistical analysis of Niemann's over-the-board games by Prof Kenneth Regan, widely regarded as the world's leading expert on cheating in chess, has also found no evidence he cheated.Not since 2006's "Toiletgate" has chess faced a cheating scandal at the elite levels of the game. Back then, world championship challenger Veselin Topalov's team accused the champion Vladimir Kramnik of cheating during his "strange, if not suspicious" trips to the bathroom. Prof Regan also found no evidence Kramnik had cheated.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Nathan Williams"><Text>Gunmen have shot dead the mayor of a small town in western Mexico, and at least 17 others, officials say.Police say gunmen stormed the San Miguel Totolapan town hall at 14:00 (19:00 GMT) on Wednesday. Photos online show it riddled with bullet holes.Mayor Conrado Mendoza Almeda's left-wing PRD party condemned his "cowardly" assassination and demanded justice.The attack has been blamed on the Los Tequileros criminal gang, which is linked to a powerful drug cartel.Police officers and council workers were also killed in the massacre, with graphic images of bloodied bodies lying on the ground circulating on social media. Mr Mendoza Almeda's father, former mayor Juan Mendoza Acosta, was also killed - in his home - before the attack moved to the town hall.A highway in the state of Guerrero, where San Miguel Totolapan lies, was reportedly briefly blocked by large vehicles to prevent security forces from getting into the city.Even by the violent standards of Guerrero state, this was a shocking attack, reports the BBC's Mexico correspondent, Will Grant.San Miguel Totolapan lies in the heart of a region known as Tierra Caliente, a violent part of drug cartel-controlled western Mexico. Various groups battle for control of the lucrative drug routes north along the Pacific corridor, our correspondent adds. The region is a hotspot for the growing of opium poppies and the production of heroin.In a preliminary report seen by local media, Guerrero's attorney general said that as well as the 18 people who were killed, three others were wounded.It is not yet clear what the motive behind the attack may have been but killings of local officials are not uncommon.In 2018, at least three dozen mayors, former mayors and mayoral candidates were killed. The number has dwindled to single figures in recent years but those who hold local office remain at risk from armed gangs, which often want to be the only authority in town.Following the attack, the defence ministry said it was deploying army and navy units to the area to find the gunmen.  Guerrero Governor Evelyn Salgado Pineda tweeted to say she deeply regretted the deaths.Shortly before the attack, alleged members of Los Tequileros released a video on social networks announcing its return to the region, where they had been fighting a rival drug gang.The criminal group devastated Guerrero between 2015 and 2017 - and was known for threatening mayors of the region - until its leader Raybel Jacobo de Almonte was assassinated.De Almonte was known as El Tequilero - the Tequila Drinker - and his gang took their name from him.Additional reporting by Tiffany Wertheimer</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Tessa Wong"><Text>I'm stuck at home taking care of a sick child, when a familiar feeling suddenly hits - a craving for durian.But there's no need to head out to a durian stall or supermarket to buy the tropical fruit, lug it home, and wrestle open its spiky husk.I just whip out my phone, open an app called Grab, and make a few taps.Forty-five minutes later, there's a knock on my door. A deliveryman hands over a bag: it's my durian, freshly shucked and sealed in plastic tubs, ready to eat.From ordering cabs and food, to paying our bills and booking holidays, super-apps like Grab offer a mindboggling array of services. They don't exist yet in the West - Elon Musk is thinking of creating one called X - but in many parts of Asia they've already been a vital part of our everyday lives for the past few years. I mostly use Grab to get a ride home after a night out, or order Thai takeaway when I haven't got the energy to cook dinner for the family.But many in Singapore also use it to send parcels and documents, or shop online - one colleague just purchased a home karaoke set.     Other extensions allow you to book bus and ferry tickets, make hotel reservations, and even arrange for someone to come to your home and do a professional Covid swab test.These can be paid for through the app's finance system. There's an e-wallet linked to your bank account or credit card, or you can set up instalment plans, or pay with points which you earn with every activity done through the app. It can also be used for cashless payments - you pay for items at a shop by scanning a QR code with the app, or you can get a physical card linked to your account.But Grab is not the only player in town.There are super-apps aplenty from Indonesia's GoJek to India's PayTM and they allow you to do even more, such as book a manicure, order fuel for your motorbike, pay your traffic fine and purchase gold. They have caught on in a region of digital natives - in South East Asia alone, about three-quarters of our population use the internet, and of that group, 88% own a smartphone.Elon Musk, Twitter and the mysterious X app Then, there's China's WeChat - the original Asian super-app said to be the inspiration for Mr Musk's X.It's a messaging and social media platform that's evolved into one of the region's biggest apps in terms of its range of services and number of users. At last count it's estimated to have 1.29 billion users in China alone. WeChat is also one of China's biggest payment networks, with consumers using it to pay for goods and services and to send money to each other. Some research suggests that a Chinese user spends as much as a third of their waking life on WeChat alone.Much has been written about how its ubiquity in Chinese everyday life, operating in a society tightly controlled by the government has seen WeChat become a tool of surveillance and censorship.Messages, posts and even accounts are routinely blocked for content deemed politically sensitive, and there are concerns of how it could contribute to the various controversial "social credit" schemes in China, where citizens' lives can be restricted based on their bank credit scores or social behaviour. In 2020, WeChat introduced its own scoring system where users get extra privileges if they have good in-app credit records.The example of WeChat highlights the main concern about super-apps - with everyone doing practically everything on just a few platforms, these apps end up collecting a vast trove of data on people, and could wield some power over our daily lives.WeChat and the Surveillance StateHow such data is treated and to what extent governments should have access to it will be part of the debate in societies where privacy is particularly prized. Mr Musk's X super-app - if it does come to fruition - may be seen by some with suspicion as a double-edged Swiss Army knife.For others though, the convenience and simplicity of living life on one app is an easy trade-off to make. There's always the option of scaling back their use, for those with deep concerns about privacy.And in open markets, specialty apps will continue to vie for users' attention, reducing the likelihood of most of the data ending up in the hands of just one or two companies - one reason for WeChat's dominance in China is because some apps like Twitter and WhatsApp are blocked there.Here in Singapore, I don't do everything on Grab. It's not because I distrust it, but I prefer using specialty apps to do other things like grocery shopping and buying clothes as they're just better at it.So I'm fine with Grab humming away in the recesses of my phone because it doesn't know everything about me, just some things - like the fact that I love delivery durian.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Ashley Lime &amp; Carolyne Kiambo"><Text>A school dormitory in western Kenya burned down a few weeks ago and several students were arrested on suspicion of arson - just the latest instance of a devastating criminal pattern that has dominated the country's education system for more than 30 years. Last year saw a particular spike in the number of boarding school arson attacks by the pupils, which students blamed on an intensified curriculum following time lost to the Covid lockdown. The second half of the year saw an average of three a week. The BBC has spoken to students whose schools have been set on fire to investigate what lies behind the regular attacks.The names of the students have been changedIt was about 16:30 on a Sunday afternoon when someone on the school field spotted the fire. At first, Lillian wasn't too worried. It was just the matron burning rubbish, someone said. But before long, screaming students began streaming out of the school building. Smoke was pouring out of Lillian's dorm. Lillian [not her real name], 15 at the time of the attack last October, was terrified. She knew her good friend was in the building having a nap."People were crying, they were traumatised… [I could see] smoke had covered the entire dorm."They watched as students at Buruburu Girls High School - in the capital Nairobi - began jumping from the windows to escape. Lillian doesn't know for sure what provoked the arson attack. But she claims that students were deeply unhappy about the amount of academic pressure they were under in the run up to national exams."We're usually in class by 4.30am every morning," Lillian told the BBC last November. Independent study then continued to 22:00, she said. Boarding schools are the main educators of secondary school-aged children in Kenya - seen as a way of getting good quality subsidised education, and places where children can concentrate on their studies.Another student, Mary, 16, confirmed that there had been no extra curricular activities last year, and said the academic schedule had been intense."We had to add more lessons to cover the syllabus in time… it was quite challenging." The terrors of Kenya’s school fire epidemic Her mother confirmed that her daughter had complained of long hours and poor student-teacher relations. The BBC asked Buruburu Girls High School to comment but it did not respond. Kenya's boarding schools are educationally demanding, admits Dr Newton Mwangi, a former principal of Passenga Secondary School who retired last year."Nowadays a child who does not make a good score to take him or her to university is like a condemned child," he says.Arson attacks are not a new issue in Kenyan boarding schools - the deadliest Kenyan school arson took place 20 years ago, killing 67 students in Machakos County, south-east of Nairobi.The fires are particularly dangerous because they are usually lit in dormitories, as was the case in Lillian's school. Although her friend finally emerged through the fire exit unscathed, 59 of the girls were reported by local media to have received hospital treatment for smoke inhalation, minor burns, and fractures.  Such attacks have historically been debated only behind closed doors - the government refuses to share data with the media on the number of school arson attacks, or discuss the issue. But in November 2021, the Ministry of Education issued a response to a parliamentary committee which had requested more information on the school arson crisis and revealed that there were 126 arson cases between January and November last year. It revealed that 302 students had been arrested in connection with those incidents and of those, 41 had appeared in court accused of arson and destruction of property.We don't know how many of those 41 were found guilty, because Kenyan courts restrict reporting on crimes involving children, children's lawyer Paul Muchiri told the BBC. One of the few convictions we are aware of took place earlier this year. An 18-year-old was found guilty of manslaughter for starting a fire that resulted in the death of 10 students at Moi Girls High School in Nairobi in 2017 when she was 14. The student, only identified as TWG, was handed a five-year prison term. The Ministry of Education statement issued in November listed what it believed to be the reasons behind the arson epidemic, which included: overcrowding, poor teacher-student relations, drug abuse, and inadequate counselling services within schools. It suggested however that the fault did not just lie with academic institutions, remarking that parents were "overprotective" of their children when accused of misbehaviour, and that the law hindered teachers' ability to discipline pupils. Its recommendations included recruiting professional school counsellors - but it also suggested "critically" examining the role of boarding schools in Kenya's education system. Lillian not only missed nine days of school as a result of the destruction, but all students' families were asked to pay collective damages, a common policy according to local media reports. Lillian's mother shared a letter from the school with the BBC dated 5 November - five days after the fire - requesting 1,500 Kenyan shillings [£10] "for damages incurred". The family lives in a slum and she says this was a huge amount of money for the family to find.The Ministry of Education did not respond to the BBC's request for an interview. School arson is not unique to Kenya, says Elizabeth Cooper, a Canadian academic and anthropologist who has spent years in Kenya studying the issue.But she says what is remarkable is its frequency, severity and collective nature. "Many students participate, sometimes planning in advance, sometimes being coerced to participate by other students… [which] points to… this idea that there could be some consensus around the logic of using arson," she told the BBC.Dr Cooper believes this might be because students feel as though setting fire to their schools is working to an extent, and that it might be time to consider a different approach to education in Kenya, which currently relies on "trying to strong-arm [students] into compliance". The potential to shift thinking on this might lie with teacher training colleges, she says, but parents, governors and politicians would all need to be brought on board, meaning it will take time "to try shifting the culture of how education is done".</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Jonathan Beale"><Text>The war in Ukraine has underlined the growing importance of space to armies on the ground. In an interview with the BBC, the head of the US Space Force, General Jay Raymond, describes it as the "first war where commercial space capabilities have really played a significant role". It's also the first  major conflict in which both sides have become so reliant on space.Gen Raymond - whose service is the newest branch of the US armed forces - avoids giving precise details of how the US and its allies have been helping Ukraine. But he gives a clear indication of what it's been doing. "We use space to help strike with precision, we use space to provide warnings of missiles, of any threat that could come to the United States or to our allies or partners," he says. There are already more than 5,000 satellites in space - most are operated for commercial purposes. But among them are hundreds of dedicated military satellites - the US, Russia and China having the largest number. Ukraine has none. But it has received significant help from the West in a number of ways. The first is providing intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance - or ISR. Ukraine has had access to unprecedented amounts of commercial satellite imagery. At a recent conference, the director of the US National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency said it had more than doubled the commercial imagery available over Ukraine in the run-up to the war.  Air Vice-Marshal Paul Godfrey, who heads the UK's Space Command, says that along with commercial and civilian ISR provided to Ukraine "there's an awful lot of nations with military capabilities in space - they're looking at Ukraine as well".Space ISR helped identify the initial build-up of Russian forces before the invasion on 24 February and the movement of troops and military hardware ever since. Satellites have been used to track Russian warships in the Black Sea, including the cruiser Moskva which was sunk by Ukraine.  Early warning radar - like the giant one at RAF Fylingdales in North Yorkshire - have also been able to track the launch of ballistic missiles.Air Vice-Marshal Godfrey says ISR satellites have also been essential for "telling the truth" about the war. He gives the example of the massacre in Bucha, near Ukraine's capital Kyiv. He says Russian claims that the bodies of dead civilians were already on the streets when they arrived were contradicted by time-stamped satellite imagery showing otherwise. Media organisations, including the BBC, have also had unprecedented access to commercial satellite imagery - which can be used to corroborate claims on the ground. That includes identifying mass graves or Ukraine's recent attack on a Russian airbase in Crimea, a southern Ukrainian peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014. Early warning radar have also been able to track the launch of ballistic missiles. The US is also now in detailed  discussions about installing more giant radar in the UK to keep an eye on what's happening in space.And recently Ukrainian volunteers have fundraised enough money to buy an entire satellite to help the country's military in detecting Russian targets.The Sar (Synthetic Aperture Radar) satellite of the Finnish company ICEYE has proved to be extremely effective - in just the first two days of its usage the Russian military damages exceeded $16m - more that the cost of the satellite purchase, Ukrainian officials say.Space has also been crucial to communications throughout the war. At the start of the war Russia conducted a series of military strikes and cyber-attacks to take out Ukraine's key communication nodes. Air Vice-Marshal Godfrey credits Elon Musk with "essentially getting the internet back up and running in Ukraine" - helped by an appeal on Twitter by the Ukrainian Minister of Digital Transformation, Mykhailo Fedorov.The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterElon Musk has sent thousands of Starlink internet kits to Ukraine giving access to SpaceX's constellation of satellites in orbit. They've been essential to providing Ukraine's military with secure communications and situational awareness throughout the war. I've seen them being used from Ukrainian command bunkers in the country's eastern Donbas region.  Both Russia, and more recently Ukraine, have been relying on space-based positioning, navigation and timing (PNT) to conduct precision strikes on key targets, with Russia's cruise missiles using its own Glonass positioning satellites to find their targets. For Ukraine, the addition of US-supplied precision weapons to its arsenal have been key to its recent advances. Himars rockets - which have a range of up to 50 miles (80km) and are guided by GPS - have been used to destroy key targets, such as ammunition dumps and command centres well behind the frontline. More recently, the US has supplied Ukraine with GPS  guided Excalibur artillery shells - more accurate than so-called dumb ammunition. Precision has made a difference. The increasing reliance on space raises concerns that conflict could spread beyond land, sea and air. Russia and China have both conducted tests to destroy their own satellites, and Admiral Tony Radakin, the UK's Chief of the Defence Staff, has recently warned that Russia could carry out attacks on Western targets in space.  Gen Raymond says "there's a full spectrum of threats we're concerned about". He lists GPS and communications jamming, direct energy weapons like lasers, or missiles fired from the ground which could be used to target satellites. He says the US and its allies want to make sure that there's always safe and responsible behaviour in space - but adds "what worries me is not everybody shares that view".

But it's a move with other Scandinavian precedents.In 2019, Sweden's monarch, King Carl XVI Gustaf, removed royal status from five of his grandchildren.It was again with a nod towards the public mood of not wanting too many royals getting taxpayers' funding.Danish Queen 'sorry' over stripping of royal titlesSwedish King removes grandchildren's royal statusHow is the Royal Family in Britain funded?It might also be seen as an inevitable consequence of the hereditary and dynastic principle of monarchy. Family trees are often going to get bigger, with widening branches of children, grandchildren and relations.So, like clipping back a royal garden, every so often there will have to be a careful pruning of those defined as having royal status.This reduced-scale approach in Denmark might be in tune with public opinion, with more than three-quarters supporting the monarchy.This is also a country where the level of public funding for the royal family - currently about £11m per year for the queen, her residences and staff - is linked to the pay index of Denmark's state-sector employees.But could this be an example for the British Royal Family, with King Charles III long associated with calls for a "slimmed-down" monarchy?This has never been very specifically defined, but has been interpreted as a plan to focus more tightly on a smaller group of royals - sending a message of purposeful frugality.It's like the wedding photograph with just the main participants rather than the group shot of whoever was there at the time.This slimming down might have already happened by default, with Prince Andrew, Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex no longer carrying out royal duties or receiving public funding. Buckingham Palace now uses the concept of "working royals" for a smaller group who carry out the round of visits, ceremonies and constitutional duties, distinguishing them from a wider range of royal relatives.The working royals include the King, Queen Consort, Prince William and Catherine, the Princess of Wales; Princess Anne; Prince Edward and Sophie, Countess of Wessex; Princess Alexandra and the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester.Last year there were 2,300 official engagements carried out. Princess Anne on her own carried out almost 400.At the Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations earlier this year, the distinction between working and non-working royals was visibly played out on the symbolic platform of the Buckingham Palace balcony.Prince Harry and Meghan, and Prince Andrew were not on the balcony to wave to the crowds. There were 18 royals on view - presenting much less of a crowd scene, when on occasions in the past there have been more than 40 people on the balcony.The reign of the new King has only just begun, but there are likely to be questions about how he might want to re-shape the monarchy and how the royal households will be run.Close to the issue of the size of the monarchy will be its cost to the public.The public funding of the Royal Family in Britain comes via the Sovereign Grant, which is based on a proportion of the profits from the independently-run Crown Estates.This pays for the running costs of the monarchy and its working royals - such as staff, travel, overseas visits, the upkeep of buildings, with £86m received last year, with extra costs from renovating Buckingham Palace pushing up overall spending to £102m.The Prince of Wales also has an income from the Duchy of Cornwall and the monarch has a private income from the Duchy of Lancaster.Although slimming down the number of cash-hungry royal buildings, rather than the number of people, could be the biggest financial question. Repairs and refurbishments to Buckingham Palace alone cost £54m last year, more than half the total of expenditure.However, the new King can look to the future with a sense of rising popularity, according to YouGov polling last month, which showed 70% now having a positive view of him, up from 54% earlier in the year and before he took to the throne.But there are big underlying generational differences in attitudes towards the monarchy, according to YouGov. While about two-thirds across all ages back the monarchy, it's below half for 18-24 year olds.Monarchies have always had to adapt to survive. As Queen Margrethe said about her own slimming-down plans, she had to "ensure that the monarchy always shapes itself in keeping with the times".</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Nadine Yousif"><Text>For humans, staying warm in the winter often means swapping out flimsy tank-tops for thick parkas. For Alaskan bears, it means eating a jaw-dropping 500lb (225 kg) of fresh salmon. These bulking creatures are the focal point of Fat Bear Week - a highly anticipated online bracket that pits the portly mammals at Alaska's Katmai National Park against one another, with voters crowning the fattest of them all.  The competition is stiff this year: Otis, a large adult bear with the record for most Fat Bear Week wins at four, is back to defend his title. He once ate 42 salmon in one sitting, and his fishing skills and patience are hard to beat. But Bear 747, winner of Fat Bear Week 2020, might give Otis a run for his money. He is one of the largest bears on earth, weighing as much as 1,400lb (635kg). Most bears know they can't compete with him. The winner of Fat Bear Week 2022 remains to be seen. Voting is open until 11 October - Fat Bear Tuesday - when the champion will be crowned. Until then, people can watch their favourite bears via livestream and follow their journey as they pile on their gains for the winter and feast at Alaska's Brooks River, located in Katmai National Park's sprawling eight million acre reserve.  Organisers of the "extremely popular" Fat Bear extravaganza say viewers tune in from almost every country in the world, and have taken quite a liking to the charismatic creatures. "It's fairly rare to get to know wild animals on an individual level," said Mike Fitz, founder of the inaugural Fat Bear Week in 2014 and the resident naturalist with explore.org, which operates the bear livestreams. Each bear has a unique story, Mr Fitz said, and some have developed quite the fan base. For example, Otis has a loyal following who enjoy his poise and calm in stressful hunting conditions. "[Otis] goes to his spot, he sits there, he waits for his meals to come to him, and it is a very successful strategy," Mr Fitz said. "He's the most patient bear that I have ever seen."Others marvel at the steadfastness of mother bears who are devoted to keeping their cubs safe and fed before they are forced to seek shelter from the cold. Fat Bear Week also teaches onlookers how North American brown bears prepare for the winter - by getting fat to survive. Bears emerge from their hibernation in the summer months weary and thin. They then spend their time hunting enormous amounts of fish. By October, they've put on so much weight that some are almost unrecognisable. In November, the bears start heading towards their dens where they will hibernate for six months. In that time, they don't eat, drink water, or pass urine or faeces."They're surviving at that time just on their body fat," Mr Fitz said, adding that they remain healthy throughout.Like its ursine* stars - [*definition: 'of, or to do with bears'] - Fat Bear Week seems to have hit its peak. Mr Fitz said votes on the first day, 5 October, had already surpassed last year's. As for who his favourite hefty hibernator is, Mr Fitz said he has officially endorsed Bear 747. "I think he is the fattest bear so he deserves the vote, but other people are welcome to disagree - and they often do," he said.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Andrew Harding"><Text>Young children are dying in growing numbers in Somalia amid the worst drought to hit the country in 40 years. Government officials say that an even greater catastrophe could sweep the country within days or weeks unless more help arrives.The tears tumbled down 11-year-old Dahir's hunger-hollowed cheeks. "I just want to survive this," he said quietly. Seated beside the family's makeshift tent, on the dusty plain outside the city of Baidoa, his weary mother, Fatuma Omar, told him not to cry."Your tears will not bring your brother back. Everything will be fine," she said. Fatuma's second son, 10-year-old Salat, died of starvation two weeks ago, shortly after the family reached Baidoa from their village, three days' walk away. His body is buried in the rocky earth a few metres from their new home - the grave already covered in litter and increasingly hard to spot as new arrivals set up camp around them. "I cannot grieve for my son. There is no time. I need to find work and food to keep the others alive," Fatuma said, cradling her youngest daughter, nine-month-old Bille, and turning to look at six-year-old Mariam as she gave a rasping cough.On the other side of the dirt road that loops to the south-east, towards the coast and Somalia's capital, Mogadishu, other displaced families told more grim stories of long treks across a drought-parched landscape in search of food.  A new survey has shown that almost two-thirds of young children and pregnant women in the camps are suffering from acute malnutrition, which, along with a high death rate, could indicate that a localised declaration of famine is already overdue."I saw my daughter [three-year-old Farhir] die before me and I could do nothing," said Fatuma, who had walked for at least 15 days with her nine children from a village called Buulo Ciir to reach Baidoa."I had been carrying her for 10 days. We had to leave her by the side of the road. We had no strength to bury her. We could hear the hyenas closing in," she continued. "I've brought nothing with me. There is nothing left at home. The cattle are dead. The fields are dry," said Habiba Mohamud, 50, clutching a piece of twine in one hand, and acknowledging that she will never return to her village.A succession of droughts, turbo-charged by climate change, is now threatening to end a pastoral way of life that has endured for centuries across the Horn of Africa.Like other new arrivals, Habiba was busy erecting a tent for her family from branches, twigs, and scavenged scraps of cardboard and plastic sheeting, hoping to finish it before the chill of night. Only after that could she turn to finding food and medical help for some of her five children.On the admissions ward in the city's main hospital, Dr Abdullahi Yussuf moved between beds, checking on his tiny, emaciated patients. Most were children between two months and three years old. All were severely malnourished. Some had pneumonia and many were battling a new outbreak of measles too. Few infants had the strength to cry. Several had badly damaged skin, broken by the swelling that sometimes accompanies the most extreme cases of hunger. "So many die before they even reach a hospital," said Dr Abdullahi, watching his team struggling to connect an intravenous tube to the arm of a moaning two-year-old.Although Somali officials and international organisations have been sounding the alarm for months about an impending famine in this south-western region, Dr Abdullahi said his hospital was already short of basic items including nutritional supplements for children."Sometimes we lack supplies. It's terrifying, actually, because people are dying, and we can't support them. Our local government is not handling this well. It has not been planning for the drought or for the arrival of displaced families," he said, with visible frustration.A local government minister conceded there had been failings."We need to be faster than we are, and we need to be accurate… and more effective," said Nasir Arush, Minister for Humanitarian Affairs for South West state, on a short visit to one of the camps around Baidoa. But more international support, he insisted, was key."If we don't receive the aid we need, hundreds of thousands of people will die. The things we're doing now we needed to do three months ago. In reality we are behind. Unless something happens [fast] I think something catastrophic will happen in this area," he said.The process of formally declaring a famine can be a complicated one, reliant on hard-to-pin-down data, and, often, political considerations. Britain's ambassador in Mogadishu, Kate Foster, described it as "essentially, a technical process". She pointed out that during the 2011 drought "half of the 260,000 deaths happened before famine was declared".The presidential envoy leading Somalia's international effort to secure more funding thanked the US government, in particular, for recent new funding, saying it "has given us hope".But Abdirahman Abdishakur warned that without more help, a localised crisis in one part of Somalia could quickly spin out of control."We were raising the alarm… but the response of the international community was not adequate," Mr Abdishakur said."Famine is projected. It happens [already] in some places, some pockets, in Somalia, but still we can prevent the catastrophic one," he continued, speaking by phone during a stopover in Toronto, Canada.Although estimates vary, the population of Baidoa has roughly quadrupled in the past few months, to around 800,000 people. And any visitor will quickly notice one striking fact: almost all the new adult arrivals are women.Somalia is at war. The conflict has endured, in different guises, since the central government collapsed three decades ago, and it continues to affect almost every part of the country, tearing men away from their families to fight for an array of armed groups.Like most of those arriving in Baidoa, Hadija Abukar recently escaped from territory controlled by militant Islamist group al-Shabab."Even now I'm getting calls on my phone from the rest of my family. There is fighting there - between the government and al-Shabab. My relatives have run away and are hiding in the forest," she said, seated beside her sickly child at a small hospital in Baidoa.Other women spoke of husbands and older sons being blocked from leaving areas controlled by the militants, and of years of extortion by the group. Baidoa itself is not quite surrounded by al-Shabab, but it remains a precarious place of refuge. International aid organisations, and foreign journalists, require heavy security to move around, and any travel beyond the city limits is considered extremely risky."We're looking at populations that are under siege. Sometimes it feels quite hopeless," said Charles Nzuki, who heads the UN children's fund, Unicef, in central and southern Somalia.According to some estimates, more than half the population affected by the current drought remains in areas controlled by al-Shabab. Strict US government rules blocking any assistance from benefitting designated terrorist groups have complicated efforts to reach many desperate communities. But international organisations, and the Somali authorities, are working with smaller local partners to increase access and are now planning air drops into some contested territories. Still, one aid worker, speaking off the record, acknowledged that it was almost impossible to guarantee that no food or funds were reaching al-Shabab."Let's not be naïve, [al-Shabab] taxes everything, even cash donations," they said. Over the years, the militant group has established a reputation not just for violence and intimidation but for delivering justice in a country with a hard-earned reputation for official corruption. In at least four villages close to Baidoa, al-Shabab runs a network of Sharia courts that are routinely used by the city's residents and, reportedly, by people in Mogadishu and beyond, to settle business and land disputes. Further to the north-east, a sudden uprising against al-Shabab has seen local communities and clan militias - now heavily backed by the central government - drive the group out of dozens of towns and villages in recent weeks. The military successes have prompted a surge of optimism, but it is not clear if that will help in the fight against famine, or simply distract the Somali government."It might, or it might not [help]. I think it may create more [civilian] displacement. Or the government might liberate more areas and people might have more access [to aid]. So, we're looking at it from all sides," said local minister Nasir Arush.In Baidoa itself - a busy city of narrow, cobbled streets scarred by decades of conflict and neglect - the prices of basic goods, like rice, have doubled in the past month. Many residents blamed the drought, but others also looked further afield."Flour, sugar, oil - they've all risen by about the same amount. Sometimes we have to skip meals. I heard about the war between Russia and Ukraine. People say that is the root cause of these problems," said Shukri Moalim Ali, 38, walking over to her dry well, and barren vegetable patch.While the fight to ward off a deeper, spreading famine is the immediate focus in this region, Somalia's new government is also looking ahead, seeking to address more existential questions about the future."It is a challenging task, to respond to the drought, to fight against al-Shabab, and to campaign to access [international] climate justice finance," Abdirahman Abdishakur said."We have a young population, an enormous diaspora, and vibrant entrepreneurial skills. So that gives us hope. It's challenging, but we don't have an alternative."</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Katty Kay"><Text>The upcoming midterm elections for US Congress, the first nationwide vote since Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol nearly two years ago, have many Americans on edge. The BBC's Katty Kay has been finding out why.Karen and Steve don't want to take up arms. But if Republicans lose in November this elderly Arizona couple say a civil war is coming and, yes, they will fight. They have discussed it between them, and feel that taking up arms is their best option. It was at this point that our conversation grew a little dark and my faith in the strength of American democracy grew a little shaky. I met the Slatons at their Trump paraphernalia store in Show Low, Arizona. It was one of the first stops on a month-long road trip that I took around America this summer, a journey to understand why the upcoming elections feel so consequential, perhaps even a little ominous.The couple were delightful hosts. They were funny and generous. They took me on a tour of their extensive stock of whacky Trump merchandise and explained that, yes, there really are people who want a $100 life-size cut-out of the former president dressed as Rambo to put in their living rooms. Quite a lot of people actually. Trump as Rambo is one of their best selling items. We talked about history, the economy and even abortion. But it was only when I questioned their belief that the 2020 election was stolen that things got tense. Wasn't it possible, I asked, that millions of Americans just didn't like President Trump and so Joe Biden won the election? It was Karen who responded, with a distinctly steely glint: "If you're a crazy liberal, we're just not interested. The central news, let me call them, I'm not going to call them fake news, but it is fake news to say that America doesn't like Trump. America loves Trump."The BBC is not fake news, but I let that pass. The idea of war, however, demanded clarification. "It will start on a small scale, it will be like town against a town, state against a state," Steve had clearly thought this through. People have been tossing this idea of a second American civil war around for a couple of years now, ever since the 2020 election, ever since the violence of the Capitol Riots on 6 January, 2021. I find it hard to believe - maybe I lack imagination - but the idea of Americans going to war over a lost election still seems implausible. But that's Steve's take on what happened last time: "When Lincoln won, that triggered the South." That's not the only view of the origins of the American Civil War, but this wasn't the moment for a history debate; it's the present that needs attention. As I said goodbye to the Slatons, Steve threw out a warning. It was said with a habitual American friendly smile, but it was chilling nonetheless: "This could turn really nasty." Just how nasty was what I was trying to find out. You can watch Katty's hour-long film in the UK on iPlayer.In the US and Canada, it is available on BBC Select.And it will be broadcast on BBC World News on 8 and 9 October. Click on the links for details.Americans cast their ballots for control of Congress every two years. The congressional elections that fall in years when they aren't voting for president are called midterms. Because the White House isn't up for grabs, midterms generally don't get much attention and turnout hovers around 40%, lower than the 50-60% that vote in presidential elections. But this year feels different. This is the first national election since the storming of the Capitol and will test whether America can hold an election without violence. And, to be clear, the war talk from Americans like the Slatons is not normal pre-election rhetoric. In two and a half decades in America I've covered 10 US election cycles, I have never heard voters talk about politics in this violent way.Karen and Steve's views are not fringe views either. The belief that the 2020 election was stolen has seeped into the mainstream like a virus that now infects the entire democratic process. Polls since the election suggest that about 70% of Republicans believe Joe Biden is not the legitimate president. That's about one third of the American electorate, or more than 50 million people - not far off the population of Britain. This summer on a tour of Arizona, Wyoming, Georgia and Pennsylvania, I spoke to dozens of voters who are convinced Joe Biden is not America's legitimate president. If you felt an election had been stolen from you, you'd be angry too. Indeed, maybe you'd feel it was something worth fighting for. The problem is there is no evidence to support the stolen election claim. More than 60 lawsuits were brought by Trump's lawyers claiming election fraud. All but one was dismissed for lack of evidence. Some of the suits were even heard by Trump appointed judges, and they, too, tossed the cases out. Key Republican election officials in battleground states, like Arizona, and Georgia, also said the election process had been fair and accurate. There is no evidence of fraud that would have overturned Joe Biden's win. That hasn't stopped the fraud conspiracy virus from spreading. Trump may have launched it, but it has now spread across the country and taken on a life of its own. It is different from policy issues like gun rights or taxes. People have strong beliefs about those things too - Steve and Karen Slaton certainly did. But disagreements on those issues have facts that both sides can debate. The "election was stolen" is not a debatable issue. There are no facts on that side of the argument. In that way it's more like an unshakable belief system, and from my interviews I'm not sure the faithful would change their minds even if Trump himself were to suddenly say Biden won fair and square. The impact of this conspiracy on the US voting system was made clear to me in Georgia, in the election offices of Paulding County, where public officials are gearing up for the midterms with some trepidation. Deirdre Holden is an unelected civil servant with the job of Supervisor of Elections and Voter Registration. She is in charge of the mechanics of voting, making sure polling stations operate smoothly, ballots are collected safely and counted accurately. Holden doesn't tear up easily, but when she rereads the threat letter she received after the 2020 election she chokes, for just a second. "This election is effing rigged," it reads. (Deirdre is exceptionally polite, she has that wonderful Southern gentility, and she wants to spare me the profanities.) "Detonations will occur at every polling site in this county. No one at these places will be spared. If you think we're bluffing, eff-ing try. You've been warned. We will end you all." Deirdre puts down the letter and wipes her eye. If I got that message, I'd be afraid to come into work, but what I'm seeing isn't fear, it's anger. "I never was scared. I was mad. Mad that someone tries to threaten us, to threaten the people that just want to cast their vote. That didn't sit very well with me," Deirdre says. When her office in Paulding County (which by the way voted for Trump, though that really shouldn't matter) received that threat after the 2020 election, they passed it onto the FBI. Agents told her she ought to start parking her car outside her office window; it would help limit the force impact of an explosion, they explained. Deirdre wasn't the only election official to be targeted after that vote. The select committee investigating the Capitol Riot interviewed several witnesses who had been threatened, along with their families. After Al Schmidt, Philadelphia's elected Republican city commissioner, defended the election's integrity and confirmed Biden's win, he got one text that read, "You lied. You [are] a traitor. Perhaps 75 cuts and 20 bullets will arrive soon." The Brennan Center for Public Justice examined the aftermath of the 2020 election and concluded that threats against both elected and unelected election officials reached unprecedented levels. According to their findings, one in three election officials said they felt unsafe doing the job. Little surprise that large numbers quit after 2020. The question is why so much mistrust and anger now? Americans have been polarised for decades and this is not the first conspiracy theory to take hold here. But we haven't seen a storming of the US Capitol before, nor so many threats to election officials, nor so much attention paid to trying to change the election rules. How will new voting laws affect the election?Tracking Trump's 'extraordinary' endorsement spreeJoe Biden says Trump ideology threatens US democracyThe answer, most political observers suggest, is a confluence of events that allowed the election denying conspiracy to spread, thereby weakening the whole system. First, Trump started saying the vote would be rigged against him, long before the election even happened. He undermined trust before a single ballot was cast. Then, election rules changed in 2020 to accommodate Covid restrictions. Election deniers say those changes, which included more early voting and more postal votes, left the system open to widespread fraud (though there's no evidence of that.) The Brennan report also points to the impact of social media. "In 2020, political actors ramped up the lies about election processes, often on social media" the report found. "This disinformation has indelibly changed the lives and careers of election officials." Almost 80% of election officials, according to the report, say the rise of misinformation has made their jobs more difficult. Over a half say it has made them more dangerous. "People just have lost their trust. And that's what breaks my heart," says election official Deirdre Holden. And like the Slatons, she leaves me with a warning - November's midterms are going to be worse. Deirdre is non-partisan. I spent a few hours with her and I can honestly say I have no idea how she votes. That's exactly as it should be. The running of democratic elections should be in the hands of officials who have no bias. The people who organise the voting, count the ballots and certify the results should not inject their own politics into the process. When they do, trust is lost. And in this respect, the dispute over 2020 has shown the American system to be uniquely vulnerable. The US is the only Western democracy where the senior election officials are not civil servants. At the state level, it is the post of secretary of state that runs the election. And that person is elected, as a Democrat or a Republican. This November there are some 200 Republicans on the ballot who say they believe the 2020 election was stolen. In at least seven states there are election deniers on the ballot who could have a direct impact on voting systems. In a close election in 2024, those people could be key in deciding who wins the White House.One of those critical posts is a state's secretary of state. In the past it was a post that got very little attention in election campaigns. It was almost an afterthought and certainly not a position that would get national or even international press attention. So the fact that I found myself flying over the desert in a private plane interviewing Arizona's candidate for secretary of state this summer, is a telling indication of how this midterm election is different. In a world where election results are contested, the secretary of state suddenly becomes very important. They have the ability to change the way people are allowed to vote and even change the rules around the count. Trump fully understands the significance of this post - on 2 January 2021 he famously called Georgia's Secretary of State, Brad Raffensperger, and urged the Republican to "find" him an extra 11,780 votes so that Trump could win the state. Raffensperger denied Trump's request. Now the former president wants to make sure that he has allies in the job of secretary of state, so that if he runs in 2024, he can count on them to help him out. In the run-up to the midterm elections, money and attention, from both parties, is pouring into the secretary of state races in half a dozen battleground states. Which is why I spent the day, and a terrifyingly bumpy plane ride, with Mark Finchem. And also why he had a private jet at his disposal in the first place. Joe Biden won Arizona by a mere 10,000 votes. Finchem is a staunch election denier who believes Trump was robbed in the state and would like to overturn the 2020 result. If he's elected this November, he plans to ban voting by mail (the preferred choice of 80% of Arizona's electorate), ban early voting, and do away with electronic voting machines - all by 2024, the next presidential contest. He says he just wants to eliminate any chance for fraud.Inflation might get her to vote Trump againMeet the BBC's 'undercover voters'His critics say Finchem is a threat to democracy who wants to control the voting process in a way that could swing the vote in Republicans' favour. One Republican state representative has even broken with Finchem and is backing his Democratic opponent in the race. Finchem has a mix of charm and vehemence that is disarming. He told me he doesn't believe Democrats could ever win Arizona, not in 2020, not in 2022 and not in 2024. He is running against Democrat Adrian Fontes and appears well positioned to win the race. In September, a poll by OH Predictive Insights showed Finchem leading Fontes 40%-35%. So, a man who says the last election was rigged and who also doesn't believe Republicans can lose the state could well end up in charge of running elections. It's not hard to see where this could go. If Finchem, and other candidates like him around the country, change the voting system in ways that make it almost impossible for their side to lose, then, come 2024, Democrats, with some reason, won't trust the results either. They will say they were robbed of victory. It won't be many voting cycles before no one trusts election results here. As I travelled thousands of miles across the country it was clear both sides believe America's democracy is in peril, for very different reasons. Each side blames the other.There's no obvious solution to this spiral of mistrust. Across the nation I heard anger, anxiety, even talk of violence. We are watching these midterms so closely, in part because of the attack of January 6th and in part because they will help set the stage for whether Donald Trump runs again. 2024 is just around the corner. It is likely to be a tumultuous couple of years. </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Alexandra Fouché in London &amp; Hugo Bachega in Kyiv"><Text>A large fire on the only crossing between the occupied Crimean peninsula and Russia was caused by a lorry explosion, Russian officials say.A blast on the road section led to oil tankers on the rail section catching fire, before the road collapsed.Crimea was annexed in 2014 by Russia, which now uses the bridge to move military equipment into Ukraine. The official Twitter account of the Ukraine government responded to the fire by tweeting: "Sick burn."An adviser to Ukraine's President Zelensky, Mykhailo Podolyak, did not directly claim Ukrainian responsibility, but wrote: "Crimea, the bridge, the beginning."Everything illegal must be destroyed, everything stolen must be returned to Ukraine, everything occupied by Russia must be expelled."Meanwhile, the Ukraine defence ministry compared the bridge explosion to the sinking of Russia's Moskva missile cruiser in April."Two notorious symbols of Russian power in Ukrainian Crimea have gone down," it tweeted. "What's next in line?"The Russian foreign ministry said "the Kiev regime's reaction towards destruction of civilian infrastructure is a testament to its terrorist nature".LIVE UPDATES: Blast causes only Crimea-Russia bridge to collapseExcitement and fear in Ukraine after bridge blastIt is hard to exaggerate the significance, and symbolism, of seeing the bridge on fire. Opened by President Putin in 2018, it was meant to symbolise that Crimea was Russian.Russia has used the bridge to move military equipment, ammunition, and personnel from Russia to battlefields in southern Ukraine. As such, Ukrainian authorities said it was a legitimate target, as they vow to retake the peninsula.Any attack on Crimea, where the Russian army has a massive presence, will be seen as another massive humiliation for the Kremlin.     The bridge is particularly hated by Ukrainians. Social media in Ukraine erupted in celebration on seeing the fire - one day after Russian President Vladimir Putin turned 70. Road and rail traffic across the bridge has been suspended. Local authorities in Crimea say they will organise a ferry service between the Russian mainland and the peninsula.Russia's National Anti-Terrorism Committee said: "At 06:07 Moscow time today [03:07 GMT], an explosion was set off at a cargo vehicle on the motorway part of the Crimean bridge on the side of the Taman peninsula, which set fire to seven fuel tanks of a train that was en route to the Crimean peninsula. "Two motorway sections of the bridge partially collapsed."Crimean parliamentary speaker Vladimir Konstantinov blamed the explosion on "Ukrainian vandals, who have finally managed to reach their bloody hands to the Crimean bridge".He added the damage to the bridge would be "promptly restored, since it is not of a serious nature".President Putin has been briefed about the "emergency" on the bridge and has ordered a government inquiry, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, in comments quoted by Interfax news agency.A criminal investigation is also under way.The 19km (12-mile) bridge across the Kerch Strait, which cost £2.7bn to build, was opened by President Putin four years after Moscow illegally annexed Crimea. It is the longest bridge in Europe, and was hailed by Russian media as "the construction of the century". Russian officials previously claimed it was well protected from threats from air, land or water.The crossing is more than 100 miles from Ukrainian-held territory. One explosives expert told the BBC the fire was probably not caused by a missile."The lack of obvious blast / fragmentation damage on the road surface suggests that an air-delivered weapon was not used," he said.He said it was possible that "a well-planned attack from below may have been the cause"."I suspect explosives on the road bridge and train deck were initiated near simultaneously using coded radio command," he added.Ukraine claimed responsibility last month for a series of air strikes on Crimea over the summer, including an attack on Russia's Saky military base.Kyiv has the momentum in this conflict. The army has reclaimed large swathes of territory, forcing Russian troops to abandon long-held positions. Amid the losses, Moscow has begun a chaotic military mobilisation - which led to rare anti-war protests in Russia, and a huge exodus of military-age men.On Russian TV talk shows, presenters and studio guests have been expressing increasing doom and gloom about the situation. </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Hugo Bachega and John Simpson"><Text>Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky says Russian officials have begun to "prepare their society" for the possible use of nuclear weapons, but added he does not believe Russia is ready to use them. In an interview with the BBC, President Zelensky denied having urged strikes on Russia, claiming that an earlier remark had been mistranslated. "You must use preventive kicks," he said, referring to sanctions, "not attacks".In recent weeks, the Ukrainian army has recaptured large swathes of territory in a successful counter-offensive that has forced Russian troops to abandon long-held positions. In what Kyiv describes as Moscow's response to its defeats, President Vladimir Putin has incorporated four partially occupied regions of Ukraine.The annexations, widely dismissed as illegal, have raised fears of a possible escalation in the seven-month war. President Putin and other senior Russian officials have suggested that nuclear weapons - possibly smaller, tactical weapons - could be used to defend those areas, although Western officials say there has been no evidence Moscow is prepared to do so.Speaking in English at the president's office in Kyiv, President Zelensky said: "They begin to prepare their society. That's very dangerous. "They are not ready to do it, to use it. But they begin to communicate. They don't know whether they'll use or not use it. I think it's dangerous to even speak about it."Then, in Ukrainian, he said through a translator: "What we see is that Russia's people in power like life and thus I think the risk of using nuclear weapons is not that definite as some experts say, because they understand that there is no turning back after using it, not only the history of their country, but themselves as personalities." However, he denied having called for strikes on Russia during an online event on Thursday, saying the Ukrainian word he had used had been misunderstood. The initial comment was denounced by Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as "an appeal to start yet another world war", while Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said it demonstrated why Russia was right to launch its operation in Ukraine."After that translation," President Zelensky said, "they [the Russians] did their way, how it's useful for them, and began to retranslate it in other directions."The interview happened hours after US President Joe Biden said that the Russian threat to use nuclear weapons had brought the world closer to "Armageddon" than at any time since the Cuban Missile Crisis during the Cold War.President Zelensky said action was needed now, as Russia's threats were a "risk for the whole planet". Moscow, he claimed, had "made a step already" by occupying the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe's largest nuclear station which President Putin is trying to turn into Russian property.   Around 500 Russian troops were at the plant, he said, although the Ukrainian staff still operate it."The world can stop urgently the actions of Russian occupiers," President Zelensky said. "The world can implement the sanction package in such cases and do everything to make them leave the nuclear power plant."Empowered by sophisticated Western-supplied weapons, the Ukrainian army has made significant advances in the east and the south, reclaiming towns and villages even in areas the Kremlin claims are now part of Russia. President Zelensky said Russian forces were putting up a "good enough fight", but that Ukraine had received weapons - "I won't say we have enough now" - and soldiers were motivated to push forward.The Russian military's setbacks, a major embarrassment for President Putin, have sparked unusual criticism of the country's military.Amid the losses, President Putin announced the mobilisation of hundreds of thousands of reservists, which led to rare anti-war protests in Russia and to a huge exodus of military-age men.President Zelensky urged Russians to "fight for your body, rights and soul", saying: "Those mobilised kids now, they come with nothing. Without guns or armour. They are being thrown here like cannon fodder... If they want to be kebabs - fine, let them come. But if they are people after all and think that this is their lives, they have to fight. "Everything Putin is afraid of, and it's not the nuclear hit, he is afraid of his community," he said. He's afraid of his people. Because only those people are capable of replacing him nowadays. Take away his power. Give it to someone else."Asked whether President Putin could survive in an eventual Ukrainian win in the war, he said: "I don't care."</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Paul Adams"><Text>Ukraine is exploding with excitement this morning.Videos of the damaged Crimean bridge have spread like wildfire on social media; this is already being compared to the sinking of the Russian warship Moskva in April."The guided missile cruiser Moskva and the Kerch bridge - two notorious symbols of Russian power in Ukrainian Crimea - have gone down," tweeted Ukraine's ministry of defence."What's next in line, Russkies?" it went on.Ukraine's inventive social media activists are gleefully pumping out memes to celebrate the occasion. And Ukraine's second largest bank, Monobank, says it has already issued a new debit card design featuring the collapsed bridge.Oleksii Danilov, Secretary of Ukraine's National Security Council, wasn't the only one noting that the attack came just a day after Vladimir Putin's 70th birthday, tweeting a video of the damaged bridge next to Marilyn Monroe's famous performance of Happy Birthday, Mr President from 1962.The sense of excitement is palpable.Coming on the back of weeks of mostly good news from the battlefront, where Ukrainian forces continue to take back territory seized by Russia back in February and March, the sight of the crippled, burning bridge is a massive additional boost to morale.Bridge explosion 'the beginning', says Zelensky adviserHow was this done? Any number of theories are doing the rounds - from a Ukrainian special forces operation to the work of partisans in Crimea, a missile strike, or even a suicide bomb."This is a masterpiece of clandestine sabotage," a former senior British army explosives expert told me. "A well-planned attack from below may have been the cause," he said. "With structural demolition, you always plan a 'collapse mechanism' which lets the weight of the structure do the majority of the work."Ukrainian officials are giving little away, happy to apply the same level of ambiguity that followed a mysterious attack on the Russian airbase in Crimea in August.But the attacks on the Saky base and the bridge are all part of the same wider effort: to undermine Russia's ability to use Crimea as a launch pad for its war in southern Ukraine. The road and railway bridges are vital links in Russia's supply chain. Without them, Moscow will find it even harder to send troops and equipment to repel Ukraine's offensive north of Kherson.Kyiv is also saying to Moscow: Crimea is ours and eventually we are going to take it back. For all the giddy delight ricocheting across social media, some Ukrainians are anxious.This morning, we left the city of Zaporizhzhia, which is still in shock after Russian missile attacks on Thursday, which left at least 17 civilians dead.People there suspect that they are being punished by Russia as Moscow lashes out after its recent military failures. They fear the coming days may bring more. </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Merlyn Thomas"><Text>Haiti has asked for foreign military support to curb its gang violence crisis which has paralysed the country.The Haitian government authorised Prime Minister Ariel Henry to request armed help due to "the risk of a major humanitarian crisis". The US meanwhile urged its citizens in Haiti to leave due to the insecurity.A group of powerful gangs have blocked the country's main fuel terminal since September, crippling its basic supplies like water and food.It is not clear to whom the request for intervention has been sent to, and in what form the help would be given.The UN said it had not received an official request from Haiti's government."That being said, we remain extremely concerned about the security situation in Haiti, the impact its having on the Haitian people, on our ability to do our work, especially in the humanitarian sphere," said UN spokesperson, Stephane Dujarric.The US is also considering a request for a humanitarian corridor to restore fuel distribution within Haiti, according to state department spokesperson Vedant Patel.Mr Patel did not say where the troops to support this would come from.Varreux fuel terminal has been controlled and blockaded by a coalition of powerful gangs since last month, which has ground the whole country to a halt. Some hospitals have shut, while businesses and transport services stopped working in protest of destitution. Civil unrest escalated since Mr Henry announced an end to government fuel subsidies on 11 September, which sent petrol and diesel prices skyrocketing.Since then, protests and looting have intensified, with the capital, Port-au-Prince, at the heart of it. Food aid warehouses have been targeted, with an estimated $5m (£4.6m) worth of food aid lost in repeated attacks, according to Haiti's UN envoy. It is unclear whether the Haitian government request for foreign military intervention would mean the return of UN peacekeeping troops, after leaving five years ago. The UN's presence has left a mixed legacy in Haiti: its peacekeepers accepted partial responsibility for sparking a cholera epidemic more than a decade ago which killed about 10,000 people. Haiti's government said eight people had died on Sunday from cholera, for the first time in three years - raising concerns over the potential for a health crisis too. Of the many supplies that have been blocked by the country's gangs, clean water is a vital one - especially as cholera is spread via contaminated water. Haiti is one of the poorest countries in the world and has suffered a number of recent crises, most notably the assassination of its president, Jovenel Moïse, in July 2021 and a massive earthquake that left more than 2,200 people dead just a month later.Deaths are frequent, with more than 200 people killed in gang violence in Port-au-Prince in the space of just 10 days in July, according to figures from the UN.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Merlyn Thomas"><Text>Ukraine says two mass burial sites have been found in the recently-recaptured eastern town of Lyman, after Russian retreated.The Ukrainian governor of the Donetsk region, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said one burial site had about 200 individual graves containing civilian bodies.It was unclear how many bodies the second site held, but it may contain both soldiers and civilians, he said.The time and cause of death for the deceased is yet to be determined. The BBC was not able to independently verify the claims. Mr Kyrylenko, writing on Telegram, said officials had begun investigating both burial sites. He also asked people not to speculate on the details until the investigation was completed.Russia withdrew its troops from the strategic town of Lyman, in a significant setback for its campaign in eastern Ukraine. Lyman is in Donetsk - one of four partially-occupied Ukrainian regions which Moscow declared it was annexing. Ukraine and its Western allies have dismissed the move as an illegal land-grab.Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has previously accused Russia of deliberately killing civilians in other locations in Ukraine.Mr Zelensky said that mass graves were found this spring in Bucha, near the capital Kyiv, and also near Mariupol - the key south-eastern Ukrainian port now occupied by Russia since its invasion of Ukraine in February.Investigators and journalists found what appeared to be evidence of the deliberate killing of civilians in Bucha and other nearby areas.Ukrainian forces said they found mass graves and evidence that civilians had been killed after their feet and hands were bound.Hundreds of graves were also found outside the eastern city of Izyum days after Russian troops retreated, according to Ukrainian authorities. It is unclear what happened to the victims, but early accounts suggest some may have died from shelling and a lack of access to healthcare. </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Omar Wally"><Text>A red toy motorbike sits in the corner of Mariam Kuyateh's home gathering dust.It was meant for her 20-month-old son, Musa, but he passed away in September. He is one of the 66 children in The Gambia who are thought to have died after being given a cough syrup that had been "potentially linked with acute kidney injuries", according to the World Health Organization.No-one in the family touches Musa's toy - a reminder of what has been lost.His 30-year-old mother, who has four other children, was in tears remembering what had happened to her son.Sitting in her home in a suburb of The Gambia's largest city, Serrekunda, she explained that his sickness started as a flu. After he was seen by a doctor, her husband bought a syrup to treat the problem."When we gave him the syrup, the flu stopped, but it led to another problem," Ms Kuyateh said. "My son was not passing urine."She returned to the hospital and Musa was sent for a blood test, which ruled out malaria. He was given another treatment, which did not work, and then a catheter was fitted, but he did not pass urine.Finally, the small child was operated on. There was no improvement."He couldn't make it, he died."Earlier this week, the WHO issued a global alert over four cough syrups in connection with the deaths in The Gambia.The products - Promethazine Oral Solution, Kofexmalin Baby Cough Syrup, Makoff Baby Cough Syrup and Magrip N Cold Syrup - were manufactured by an Indian company, Maiden Pharmaceuticals, which had failed to provide guarantees about their safety, the WHO said.The Indian government is investigating the situation. The firm has not responded to a BBC request for comment.There is a lot of anger in The Gambia over what has happened. There are growing calls for the resignation of Health Minister Dr Ahmadou Lamin Samateh, along with the prosecution of the importers of the drugs into the country."Sixty-six is a huge number. So we need justice, because the victims were innocent children," Ms Kuyateh said.Five-month-old Aisha was another victim.Her mother, Mariam Sisawo, realised one morning that after having taken the cough syrup, her baby was not passing urine.On an initial visit to the hospital, the 28-year-old was told that there was nothing wrong with her daughter's bladder. It took two more trips there on consecutive days before Aisha was referred to a hospital in the capital, Banjul, which was 36km (22 miles) away from their home in BrikamaBut after five days of treatment there, she died."My daughter had a painful death. At a certain time when the doctors wanted to fix a drip on her, they could not see her veins. Myself and two other women in the same ward, we all lost our children."I have two sons and Aisha was the only girl. My husband was very happy to have Aisha and he still can't come to terms with her death." The Gambia does not currently have a laboratory capable of testing whether medicines are safe and so they have to be sent abroad for checking, Gambia health services director Mustapha Bittay told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme.But Ms Sisawo believes the government should be more vigilant."This is a lesson for parents, but the greater responsibility is with the government. Before any drugs get in to the country, they should be properly checked if they are fit for human consumption or not," she said.Isatou Cham was too distressed to talk about the death of her two-year-and-five-month-old son, Muhammed.She left the living room of their home in Serrekunda crying with her two other children.Muhammed's father, Alieu Kijera, explained what had happened to his little boy.He said he was taken to hospital when he had a fever and was unable to pass urine. But the doctors were treating Muhammed for malaria and his condition was getting worse.The medics then said he should be treated in neighbouring Senegal, where the health service is thought to be better, but while there was some improvement, it still did not save him.Mr Kijera is angry that his country does not have a good enough health system and he was forced to travel abroad. "If there was equipment and the right medicine, then my son and many other children could have been saved," he said.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="BBC News, author unspecified"><Text>The school district in Uvalde, Texas, has suspended its entire police force following protests by parents of children killed in a shooting there. The suspension will be indefinite, the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District (UCISD) said in a statement.Recent developments "have uncovered additional concerns with department operations", it added. Nineteen children and two teachers died in the attack at Robb Elementary School on 24 May.Police have been accused of botching the response to the fatal shooting.A July investigation into the shooting by the Texas legislature found "systemic failures and egregiously poor decision-making" by those involved in the response.The UCISD is responsible for supervising the security of schools in the Uvalde area, including Robb Elementary.The school district's police force consisted of five officers and one security guard, according to its website.Their officers were among the first of nearly 400 police to respond to the attack by a rifle-wielding 19-year-old gunman, who was eventually shot and killed by a border patrol agent.State troopers have been asked to help provide security for the school district, the UCISD statement said.There are still two ongoing investigations into the police response to the school shooting. It recently emerged that a police officer newly hired by the Uvalde school district is being looked into for her conduct on the day of the shooting, while she was working as a state trooper. Officer Crimson Elizondo was fired from the force on Thursday. Also on Friday, the acting district police chief was placed on administrative leave while the director of student services of the Uvalde school district announced his decision to retire.Parent of the shooting's victims have been camped outside school offices for days. They praised the district's decision to suspend the entire police force."They don't know how to hire people, they don't know how to vet officers," mother Kimberly Rubio, told ABC News, adding that the move to suspend the entire force is "what we've been asking for - it's more than we've been asking for".The former head of the police department for the school district, Pete Arredondo, was fired in August. He was one of the first officers on the scene that day, and received much of the blame for the botched response. The Texas Department of Public Safety has said that Mr Arredondo wrongly told officers under his command to treat the situation as if they were dealing with a barricaded gunman rather than an active shooter, which would have prompted a more urgent enforcement reaction. </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="BBC News, author unspecified"><Text>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has declared a state of emergency to address a "crisis situation" over an influx of migrants.More than 17,000 have arrived in the city from the southern border since April.Republican states like Texas, Arizona and Florida have been sending migrants to Democratic areas in recent months. It's part of a row with the White House as unprecedented numbers of people arrive at the US-Mexico border.Since September, an average of five to six buses have been arriving in the city each day, Mr Adams said at a press conference on Friday. He said that one in five people in the city shelter system is currently an asylum seeker. Many of those arriving are families with school-aged children and are in serious need of medical care, he said. The influx is on track to cost New York $1bn (£900m) this fiscal year, and the mayor is calling for federal and state funding to help with the costs. "New Yorkers are angry," said Mayor Adams. "I am angry too. We have not asked for this. There was never any agreement to take on the job of supporting thousands of asylum seekers."He added: "The city is going to run out of funding for other priorities. New York City is doing all we can, but we are reaching the outer limit of our ability to help."The city's social services are "being exploited by others for political gain", he added.Three states - Texas, Arizona and Florida  - have transported migrants to Democratic-led areas, focusing on self-proclaimed "sanctuary" cities that limit their co-operation with federal immigration authorities.Why are migrants being sent to Democrat-run areas?Republican officials in border states say the tactic is aimed at mitigating the impact of migration flows.They have also said the measure is designed to increase pressure on the administration of President Joe Biden to do more to reduce the number of migrants crossing the southern US border, which has hit a record high this year.The Democratic-run city of El Paso, Texas, has been offering migrants free rides to New York City and Chicago as a means of alleviating the strain on city resources. El Paso alone has transported more than double the number of migrants - nearly 9,000 - to the two northern cities than have been sent by the Texas governor.El Paso officials say the rides are voluntary, and that they co-ordinate with the destination cities to help the migrants upon arrival. As part of his emergency declaration, the New York mayor issued an executive order that allows the city to dedicate resources to support the asylum seekers and expedite any response efforts. A spokeswoman for Texas Governor Greg Abbott dismissed the declaration by the mayor on Friday."The true emergency is on our nation's southern border where small Texas border towns are overrun and overwhelmed by hundreds of migrants every single day as the Biden administration dumps them in their communities," said Renae Eze.Ms Eze said that, as of October, Texas had sent around 3,100 migrants arriving in the state to New York on more than 60 buses.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Patrick Jackson"><Text>A tractor is one of the odder gifts for Vladimir Putin, as Russia's president, a pariah in the West since his invasion of Ukraine, turns 70.It was given him by his Belarusian ally, Alexander Lukashenko, whose country boasts a tractor works.Mr Lukashenko confirmed the news as he visited his fellow strongman's home city, St Petersburg, for talks.Mr Putin was hosting other leaders of ex-Soviet states as the war fanned by his invasion raged.Faced with successful Ukrainian counter-attacks, he hinted at problems this week, describing the situation in regions he recently annexed as "restive".But on Friday, his allies lavished praise and gifts on the man who has led Russia, whether as president or prime minister, for more than two decades.Mr Lukashenko, Europe's self-styled "last dictator" who has been in power even longer than the Russian leader (since 1994) and whose administration is also under Western sanctions, came to St Petersburg with a gift certificate for the Belarusian-made vehicle.Belarus, Ukraine, Russia activists win Nobel prizeThe Minsk Tractor Works is the flagship of Belarusian industry.It was not immediately clear how Mr Putin responded to the big-wheeled gift, which had to compete with mountains of melons and watermelons from Tajikistan's President, Emomali Rahmon.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterHowever, it is a fact that Mr Putin has been frequently seen in tractors for some years now.Along with the gifts came praise for Mr Putin for "transforming the image of Russia, strengthening its sovereignty and its defence capability, and protecting its national interests", in the words of the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill."The number one patriot in the world" was how Ramzan Kadyrov, Chechnya's Moscow-backed leader, put it.Further afield, but dealing with similar international isolation, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un congratulated the man in the Kremlin for "crushing the challenges and threats of the United States".Mr Putin's enemies used the occasion of his birthday again to depict him as a war criminal trying to destroy another country while ruining his own.Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov called on Russia's military to reject him and refuse to fight his war, saying Mr Putin was "hiding in a bunker rather than standing" with his soldiers.Some social media users noted the irony of Mr Lukashenko's gift to Mr Putin: the humble tractor became an early symbol of Ukrainian resistance to the Russian invasion after farmers were seen towing away abandoned military vehicles.     In the Czech capital, Prague, demonstrators mocked Russia's president with a giant dummy depicting him as a naked emperor sitting on a golden toilet.  </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="BBC News, author unspecified"><Text>A jailed Belarus activist and two groups from Ukraine and Russia have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for championing human rights and democracy.The decision to honour Ales Bialiatsky, Russia's Memorial and the Ukrainian Centre for Civil Liberties (CCL) is a rebuff to two authoritarian leaders.Russia forced Memorial to close last December, ahead of Vladimir Putin's decision to invade Ukraine.Bialiatsky was imprisoned amid protests against Belarus's Alexander Lukashenko.Ukraine's CCL has monitored political persecutions and crimes against humanity in areas of the country occupied or annexed by Russia.Norwegian Nobel Committee head Berit Reiss-Andersen told reporters that all three had made "an outstanding effort to document war crimes, human right abuses and the abuse of power".Asked whether the committee was sending a signal to Russia's leader on his 70th birthday, she pointed out that the Nobel prize was always awarded "for something and to somebody and not against anyone".Belarus's long-time ruler is a close ally of President Putin. After a re-election in 2020 that was widely condemned as rigged, he brutally cracked down on protesters and then allowed Russian forces to use his country as a launchpad in its war against Ukraine.ANALYSIS: Putin's dream of victory slips away in UkraineAles Bialiatsky, 60, founded Belarus rights group Viasna, which means spring, in 1996, two years after Mr Lukashenko came to power. He was first jailed in 2011, then last year, he was detained again without charge. He is one of 1,348 people who Viasna says are currently held as political prisoners in Belarus.Exiled opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya praised the Nobel committee's "recognition for all Belarusians fighting for freedom and democracy" and Bialiatsky's wife Natallia Pinchuk said she was "overwhelmed with emotion".A foreign ministry spokesman in Minsk said Alfred Nobel was "turning in his grave" following the decision to hand Bialiatsky the Nobel Peace Prize.Memorial is one of the oldest human rights groups in Russia. Led initially by another Peace Prize laureate, Andrei Sakharov, in the late 1980s, its work uncovered the true scale of Joseph Stalin's repression in the form of Gulag camps of forced labour, where tens of millions of people are thought to have died.But it went on to document more recent human rights abuses, including kidnappings and torture in the Russian republic of Chechnya. The head of its Chechen branch, Natalia Estemirova, was murdered in 2009. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterIn December 2021, Russia's Supreme Court liquidated Memorial, although it continues to operate in a harsh climate where criticism of the war in Ukraine is considered a criminal offence.The head of International Memorial, Elena Zhemkova, told the BBC that the Nobel prize would help their work: "We always said at Memorial that memory of the past and human rights have no boundaries. To understand the Soviet past demands joint efforts. No country can privatise the memory about the war and repression."However, officials in Moscow were less impressed. The head of Russia's human rights council, Valery Fadeyev, urged Memorial to reject the prize, describing it as completely discredited, Tass news agency reports.Although a Ukrainian organisation was jointly awarded the peace prize, there was some annoyance in Kyiv that it was shared with representatives of Belarus and Russia. "Neither Russian nor Belarusian organisations were able to organise resistance to the war. This year's Nobel is 'awesome'," tweeted presidential adviser Mikhailo Podolyak sarcastically.Ukraine's Centre for Civil Liberties has in recent months turned its attention to abuses committed by Russian forces, after spending the previous years documenting political persecution in Russian-annexed Crimea and crimes in areas of eastern Ukraine run by Russian-backed separatists.The centre's head, Oleksandra Matviychuk, said she was delighted they were sharing the prize with "our friends and partners at Memorial and Viasna". In order to give the hundreds of thousands of victims of war crimes a chance of justice, she said an international tribunal should be created to "bring Putin, Lukashenko and other war criminals to justice". </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Mark Lowen in Rome and Elsa Maishman in London"><Text>Central heating will be restricted in Italy this winter, as it becomes the latest country to take action on European gas supply shortages sparked by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Under a new government decree, buildings will face an extra fifteen days without central heating. Italians will also be told to turn their heating down by one degree, and off for an extra hour a day. Some buildings will be exempt, including nurseries and hospitals.The move comes as governments across Europe look to reduce demand and shore up energy supplies ahead of winter. Many were dependent on gas from Russia, which has been restricted following the war in Ukraine. Before February's invasion, Italy was the second-largest importer of Russian gas in the EU, with imports making up 40% of its total supply. This is now down to just 10%, as Rome has turned to other sources of energy and liquified natural gas. The country normally restricts the use of central heating in warmer months, with its use determined by regional governments. With bills already soaring, reactions from Italians have been mixed."For old people who will stay at home a lot of time, probably it will be a problem for them," one told the BBC."It's probably needed, but it's hard. Now that this crisis is affecting us personally, it could lead more people to change their view on still backing sanctions on Russia," said another.How are countries tackling energy bills? EU leaders consider how to cap gas pricesHow can the world cope without Russian oil and gas?Many European governments have announced similar energy-saving plans. In France, homes and offices will be heated to a maximum of 19C, there will be no hot water in public buildings, and the temperature in swimming pools and gyms will also be reduced. A ban on doors being left open in heated or air-conditioned shops, which was previously in effect in some areas, has been extended nationwide. Spain has also previously mandated that heating not rise above 19C, as well as ordering that doors should be closed so as not to waste heat and that lights in shop windows must be turned off after 22:00.And Germany has stopped lighting up public monuments and buildings for aesthetic reasons, and warned heating may be turned off in the entrances, corridors and foyers of public buildings. At an EU summit in Prague on Friday, leaders are discussing capping wholesale gas prices to protect consumers.Many individual states have already introduced national caps on the price consumers pay for units of energy. Other measures have already been agreed across the bloc, including windfall taxes on surplus profits made by fossil fuel companies, and a levy on excess profits made by non-gas electricity producers.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Nathan Williams"><Text>A fire has damaged the enigmatic statues on Easter Island, with some of the charring said to be irreparable. An unknown number of the stone-carved statues have been affected by the blaze, Chile's cultural heritage undersecretary said.Easter Island has nearly 1,000 of the megaliths, known as moai. They have oversized heads and generally stand about 4m (13ft) high. They were carved by a Polynesian tribe more than 500 years ago. The fire, which broke out on Monday, affected nearly 60 hectares (148 acres), cultural heritage official Carolina Perez Dattari tweeted.It is reported to have been started deliberately, and is centred around Easter Island's Rano Raraku volcano - which is a Unesco World Heritage Site.Easter Island lies 3,500km (2,174 miles) off the coast of Chile. It relies on tourism and reopened just three months ago following its closure during the Covid-19 pandemic. The site has now been closed again while a conservation team examines the extent of the damage.The island's Mayor, Pedro Edmunds, told local media: "The damage caused by the fire can't be undone." The are some 1,000 giant stone statues and carvings on Easter Island, the largest of which weigh 74 tonnes and stand 10m tall.The figures were carved by the indigenous Rapa Nui people sometime between the years of 1400 and 1650, and positioned to form a ring around the island, facing inland.They were figures of spiritual devotion for the Rapa Nui, embodying the spirit of a prominent ancestor. Each one was considered to be the person's living incarnation.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Guy Hedgecoe"><Text>Spanish prosecutors are investigating a group of male university students filmed chanting obscene misogynistic abuse at female students in Madrid.Videos have circulated for days of abuse being hurled from the windows of an all-male student building late on Sunday at women in the block opposite.Spanish PM Pedro Sánchez criticised the "macho, inexplicable, unjustified and absolutely repugnant behaviour". It has drawn political condemnation and triggered widespread debate. One student shouted: "Whores, come out of your holes, bunnies. You are a load of nymphomaniac whores."Then, in a choreographed move, fellow students across the Colegio Mayor Elías Ahuja building pulled opened their blinds and started shouting and making animal noises. As Sunday night's video of students from Complutense University went viral, there was an immediate backlash from politicians across the spectrum.Socialist party prime minister Mr Sánchez said: "We should not give any excuse for these behaviours which surely don't represent the general feeling of Spanish society."I think it's important that all political parties and the media express a clear 'no' to these macho behaviours, and do not give a take a single step back on real equality between men and women."The leader of the conservative opposition Popular Party, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, called for society "to finish with these intolerable sexist attitudes".  Madrid's public prosecutor has opened an investigation to decide whether the incident amounts to a hate crime. The scandal has left the Elías Ahuja residence under national scrutiny. In a statement it said the episode had been "incomprehensible and inadmissible" and "contrary to the ideas and values" of the institution. It has expelled the alleged ringleader and said that others involved will attend a course on gender equality.  However, some of the residents of the Santa Mónica all-female building, which was the target of the abuse, have apparently defended the male students implicated and claimed that the incident has been blown out of proportion.  A statement attributed to residents of the Santa Mónica accommodation said: "Despite the seriousness of their words, this is a practice which is a tradition between university residences, which has created an impression of hate and sexism which could not be further from reality."It was not clear how many female residents supported the statement, which was posted on social media. And others have given a very different view. Ángela Ruiz, a former resident of Santa Mónica, wrote: "I was one of those 'Mónica whores' and I heard these kinds of shouts EVERY DAY for the two years I was at the residence."  This affair comes as Spain's coalition government has been making efforts to promote gender equality and eliminate violence against women. In May, congress approved legislation, known as the "Only yes means yes law", making it easier for victims of sexual violence to prosecute their assailants by emphasising the importance of consent.  A study last year found that one in five young Spanish men did not believe that gender violence existed, instead seeing it as an "ideological invention". Meanwhile, another disturbing video apparently of the Elías Ahuja residence from several years ago has been circulating. In it, students are shown making what appears to be a Nazi salute as they sing the words "Sieg Heil". </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="BBC News, author unspecified"><Text>In our series of letters from African journalists, Ismail Einashe meets some Kenyan musicians with a cult following who are challenging the status quo.Crystal Axis, a five-piece Afro-punk band, has established itself as one of the leading group on Kenya's burgeoning rock music scene. I find them rehearsing in a recording studio at the International Trade Fair Grounds, on the outskirts of the Kenyan capital, Nairobi.One of the guitarists plays distorted riffs on his instrument with a scratchy, heavy sound as the drummer energetically beats his drums. The group is made up of Ahmed Bulhan, known as AB, on vocals, Djae Aroni and Fox Elijah on guitar, Doug Kihoro on bass and Dan Gichia on drums and percussion.Their origin lies in Nairobi's late noughties alternative music scene, which had a number of bands performing everything from indie rock and punk to heavy metal. At the time Aroni was at school when one night he snuck out of home to see a post-hardcore band, Jack the Hammer. The lead singer and guitarist happened to be Elijah. Seeing Elijah rocking it out on stage in his black skinny jeans, classic Vans and fierce punk attitude had an impact - and the next day Aroni went to school and told his friends he wanted to start his own rock band. Shortly afterwards in 2009 he set up Crystal Axis and was soon joined by AB, with Elijah and Kihoro joining in 2017 and Gichia last year.Growing up as teenage rockers and performing while still in secondary school posed its problems, says Aroni.They had to dodge bouncers at clubs who demanded to see their IDs: "We literally had to bribe our way into our own gigs."Unlike most young Kenyans who are into Afrobeats or hip-hop, the raw energy of punk rock was their inspiration.For Aroni it came from watching US group Green Day's live film Bullet in a Bible and seeing lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong holding his crotch while gyrating wildly on stage. He thought to himself then: "This is what I want to do."His bandmate Kihoro was inspired by listening to Scandinavian death metal, while drummer Gichia honed his musical skills in his teens playing in a local Christian rock band. In 2017 the band released their first major EP, Leopold - a commentary on the mass colonial atrocities committed by King Leopold II of Belgium in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo. Since then they have released three more EPs that have garnered them a devoted following in Kenya and internationally - people drawn to their bold, infectious and distinctly punk rock sound. Their lyrics, in English and a smattering of Swahili, are highly political and delve into everything from colonial history and corruption to racism. "[We want to] tell African stories from an African perspective," Aroni says.Their hit single Nyayo House addresses the legacy of Daniel arap Moi, Kenya's longest-serving president, who led what became known as the "Nyayo regime". The raging lyrics shine a light on a harrowing aspect of Kenyan oppression and are an indictment of an era when there was no freedom of expression in the East African nation.Nyayo House is a high-rise government building in central Nairobi infamous for its torture chambers used for opponents of Moi, who was in power from 1978 to 2002. "We are dissidents… Nyayo is sickening," scream the lyrics of the song, which AB says is about "generational trauma" and the need for Kenyans to speak about this history. In August Crystal Axis released their latest EP, Black AF, a celebration of contemporary African identities.It draws on their own experiences as young black Africans who contend with various challenges such as corruption, but is also a celebration of their strength, talent and creativity. The band also wants to use the power of punk rock music to create a space for young Kenyans to make this music on their own terms.Another aspiration is to reclaim punk rock history, which they say has been "whitewashed" and the contribution of black punk artists often forgotten. Aroni gives the example of black pioneers like Death, a proto punk band founded in Detroit in 1971, which tends not to be credited for its development of the early punk sound.In the late 1970s punk heyday other black bands also played an important role in the explosive growth of the genre with groups such as Pure Hell, formed in Philadelphia in 1974, and X-Ray Spex, formed in London in 1976 by the Somali-British punk pioneer Poly Styrene.As part of their efforts to challenge the image of punk rock music as a genre dominated by white, male bands, Crystal Axis was meant to play at the Decolonise Fest in the UK last month.The festival celebrates punk music by people of colour, but the band members were denied visas to enter the UK - much to their outrage and disappointment as they had sold out shows in Leeds, Manchester and London. But this has not dented their ambition - and they see punk rock as a powerful means to channel their rage, intellectual curiosity, joy and hopes.In the recent Kenyan elections the majority of the band members did not vote, with Kihoro saying Kenyan politics is "full of old men".Aroni agrees, adding that most young Kenyans feel powerless to alter the political landscape: "We are disenfranchised. There's nothing we can do."Yet Crystal Axis' lyrics are a warning that young people should not be ignored.Their 2020 song Take The Throne about "over policing" in Kenya and the violence of the state explodes with words: "Send your soldiers, send your mob. We're 50 million, and we're tenfold strong."Rip it down! We'll build again from scratch.

It focussed its attention on two permanent members of the UN Security Council: China and Russia.The Human Rights Council is the world's top human rights body. Its mandate is to promote human rights everywhere, to condemn violations everywhere, without fear or favour.The council has done some excellent work. Its commission of inquiry for Syria has produced painstaking, forensic reports several times a year since that long conflict began in 2011. The fact-finding mission for Myanmar reported in graphic detail the suffering of the Rohingya community, and made it clear that Myanmar's ruling junta were responsible.Of course, no country, big or small, likes sitting on the council's naughty step, and they all try to avoid it. But some succeed, and others do not.  This week, China succeeded, to the bitter disappointment of human rights groups.In August, minutes before she left office, the outgoing UN Human Rights Commissioner Michelle Bachelet finally published her report on violations against Uyghur Muslims in China's Xinjiang province. As many rights activists had predicted, it contained evidence of widespread abuse, from arbitrary detention, to forced labour, to torture. Abuse which could amount, Ms Bachelet said, to crimes against humanity.Torture claims against China Uyghurs credible - UNWho are the Uyghurs? 'Don't turn a blind eye to Uyghur suffering'The logical next step after a report like that is a debate at the Human Rights Council, the appointment of a special expert to monitor the country concerned, or even a full-blown commission of inquiry. Western diplomats, led by the US and the UK, took a minimalist approach and asked only for a debate, and they lost.China lobbied hard, especially among African countries which have benefitted from Beijing's investment. Its ambassador suggested most of the world was weary of the west's "political manipulation". It's us today, he told developing nations, it will be you tomorrow. When the votes were counted, just 17 member states supported a debate, 19 rejected it, and 11 abstained. Just one African country - Somalia - said yes. Most, from Mauritania, to Senegal, to Ivory Coast and Cameroon, backed China.The vote reflects China's position as a global superpower, able to influence smaller UN member states who may rely on it for economic support. But it also, as the next vote about Russia showed, reveals deep divisions about what human rights are, and who should be defending them.Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Moscow's diplomats, who once strode purposefully from meeting to meeting at the United Nations in Geneva, have been increasingly isolated. Russia was ousted from its seat on the Human Rights Council last March, and can now only participate as an observer. When this week's resolution to appoint a UN special rapporteur to monitor human rights in Russia came up for discussion, Western diplomats and rights activists were confident it would be approved.The crackdown on dissent in Russia has become ever more brutal, with mass arrests, beatings and the suppression of independent media. Russian human rights groups bravely continuing their work were looking to the UN for support.Like the resolution on China, the proposal on Russia went to a vote, and this time it was passed. "Happy 70th birthday, Mr Putin," tweeted one jubilant Western diplomat. But examine the votes, and there really is not much for the West to celebrate. Just 17 council members voted in favour, six said no, and a staggering 24 abstained. Again and again countries who abstained - India, Pakistan, Mexico, Armenia, Honduras - argued that finger pointing was not constructive. Dialogue please, they said, not blame. Sovereign countries need to deal with these issues themselves, it was suggested, without unwanted interference from do-gooders in the West.These arguments have been taking place at the UN Human Rights Council for years, but never have they been so stark. Human rights, or so the declaration of 1948 says, are supposed to be universal. The Human Rights Council is mandated to uphold, promote and defend them, and to call out violations. The member states on the council are supposed to work together, the common aim of universal human rights for all is supposed to take precedence over national interests, and geopolitical differences.Increasingly, that idea, created by those who had endured the horrors of World War Two, including Russia and China, looks like a fantasy. Powerful countries can use their power to avoid scrutiny, less powerful ones will join together to argue that they don't need any outside interference. The losers, rights groups say, will be not only the thousands of people who suffer repression and abuse, but all of us.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Sam Cabral"><Text>US cannabis policy has been thrust to the fore after President Joe Biden issued a blanket pardon for Americans federally convicted of possessing small amounts of the drug.Mr Biden also urged governors to do likewise on state offences and called for a review on whether cannabis should be listed as a less serious drug.Federal law currently classifies cannabis as a Schedule I controlled substance, meaning it has "no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse".As one White House official noted, that's "the same schedule as for heroin and LSD, and it's even higher than the classification for fentanyl and methamphetamine - the drugs that are driving [America's] overdose epidemic"."It makes no sense," Mr Biden said on Thursday, as he directed his attorney general and health secretary to oversee a review."Too many lives have been upended because of our failed approach to marijuana. It's time that we right these wrongs."The news came as a surprise to many, but it has set cannabis stocks ablaze. Advocates say the move is a first - albeit overdue - step to bringing a $33bn (£30bn) industry out of the shadows and providing relief to those impacted by a "war on drugs" that began in the 1970s."It's a welcome conversation starter," said Kassandra Frederique, executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance non-profit."We've been waiting for some action around cannabis reform federally, so we welcome the opportunity to use it for a much broader conversation about reform."As the White House itself has noted, Mr Biden's pardons - for "simple possession" - are limited in scope. Only about 6,500 people with federal convictions and some District of Columbia (DC) residents are eligible for the relief.That's because, while nearly 29 million Americans have been arrested for cannabis-related violations since 1965, nobody is currently in federal prison solely for possession. In addition, most convictions for possession are at the state and local level, and presidential pardons only apply to federal charges.Ms Frederique argues, however, that the president's actions have "put teeth behind" efforts to relieve the perceived harms of cannabis prohibition.Organisations like hers are calling on the president to de-schedule the drug - that is, repeal cannabis from the US Controlled Substances Act of 1970 and regulate it in the same way as alcohol or tobacco."Without de-scheduling, people are going to keep facing criminal charges and be denied federal benefits; marijuana research will continue to face hindrances; veterans won't be able to access medical cannabis programmes; federal employees can still be fired for using cannabis; entrepreneurs and businesses will not have access to funding; and, banks will continue to be hesitant to offer loans," Ms Frederique said.If the Biden-initiated review does ultimately call for re-classifying cannabis, the federal government will be catching up to reforms already underway in several US states.Currently, 37 states and DC have legalised medical cannabis, while 19 states have approved the drug for recreational use. That represents well over 40% of the US population.Voters in five more states - Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota and South Dakota - will cast ballots next month on whether to allow recreational cannabis use, with at least four more ballot referendums expected in 2023 and 2024.It is a reflection of how much the politics of cannabis reform have changed over a short period of time. A Gallup poll last year showed that a record 68% of Americans are now in favour of legalising the drug.And, while Democrats and independents are far more likely to support loosening restrictions on cannabis use, about half of Republicans are also on board, the poll shows.Reacting to Mr Biden's announcement on Thursday, Republican congresswoman Nancy Mace of South Carolina gave "credit where credit is due"."I don't always agree with the Biden administration, I've been very vocal about that, but this is a step in the right direction," Ms Mace told the Fox Business Network.In fact, Mr Biden's actions represent an about-face on his own track record as a lawmaker. He claims to have never touched cannabis and, over a 35-year tenure in the US Senate, authored and voted in favour of many tough-on-drug laws.Industry experts expect that broad praise for his Thursday announcement will benefit the president and his party in midterm elections next month that threaten Democrats' control of Washington."Moving to repeal the federal prohibition of marijuana isn't just good policy. It's good politics," Paul Armentano, deputy director of the National Organisation for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) advocacy group, told the BBC.He argued that, by engaging with the matter from his bully pulpit, the president is "taking an issue that has been seen politically as a fringe issue, and has legitimised it".But it is only Congress - not the president - who can unilaterally act to amend or repeal cannabis prohibition.Bills to de-schedule cannabis and to ease the financial burdens on cannabis retailers have passed this year in the US House of Representatives - but none of these efforts have advanced in the upper chamber of Congress. That is in spite of vocal backing for certain measures by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who holds the power to bring bills to the floor but has been unable to garner enough support. "By having the most powerful elected politician in this country talking about marijuana policy and taking steps to impact marijuana policy, that has elevated this debate," said Mr Armentano."He has squarely put the pressure back on Congress, where it belongs, and said: it's up to you to finish the job."</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Laura Bicker in North-east Thailand &amp; Frances Mao in Singapore"><Text>Duangphan Patphaothanun is wandering outside a childcare centre, clutching a bag full of toys. The 64-year-old grandmother wants to know when she can see her grandson, so she can place his most treasured possessions with him in his coffin - the bag includes a large plastic dinosaur. Three-year-old Pattarawut is among the 23 children who died on Thursday in a gun and knife attack at a childcare centre in Thailand's north-east. A former policeman had stormed the building, killing children as young as two while they slept, leaving at least 37 people dead. More than 90 children usually attend the centre but because of poor weather and a bus breakdown only 24 of them were there on Thursday. Only one child has survived.Police say the 34-year-old attacker - a local named Panya Kamrab - killed his wife and his step-son, before killing himself after a manhunt. His step-son used to attend the centre but hadn't been for the past month. The motive for the attack is not yet known. But police said Kamrab was fired from his job in June for drug use. "When I heard the news about the shooting, I just fainted," Duangphan said. On her phone are photos of Pattarawut, taken just hours before the shooting. Like many childcare centres, this one too regularly posts photo updates for parents to see - the images show happy, smiling faces, writing or finishing a drawing. Duangphan was one of several grieving relatives who had gathered outside the centre in Nong Bua Lamphua province on Friday morning. Another grandmother, 46-year-old Nipha Lawongsechaison, says she lost both a grandson and granddaughter in the attack."I am full of such pain... [and] anger because I cannot do anything," she says. She's not the only one. Others too say they are filled with grief - and unanswered questions. "Why did he take it [out] on the children? Why kill them when they did nothing to him?" says 27-year-old Naliwan Dungkhet, whose two-year-old nephew Captain also died in the attack. He was just a month away from his third birthday. 'It's shocking' - witnesses describe nursery attack horrorThai pre-school attack: What we knowAmong the mourners was Komsan Norraburh. His ex-wife married the attacker who killed both her and Norraburh's three-year-old son, Worraphat."I was at the factory [when] my friend asked me to check the news. I called my ex-wife and son to see if they were ok but no-one answered," he said. "He was a good boy who liked to talk a lot. I'm waiting to pick up his body and see his face one last time."Many of the relatives said they had waited outside the childcare centre well into the night on Thursday, while others gathered at the police station.They would eventually be greeted by the sight of pink and white coffins adorned with gold, bearing the bodies of the children, which were brought to a hospital morgue in Udon Thani and laid out in rows. Police said the armed attacker broke into the building just after lunch time on Thursday, shooting his way past a teacher and parent outside. He was recognised by one of the teachers when he burst in.Witnesses said he first shot staff - including a teacher who was eight months pregnant- before forcing his way past teachers into a room where children were napping. He then stabbed most of his victims before fleeing.Officers who rushed to the nursery were confronted with the bodies of adults and children, lying inside and outside the building. Kamrab had appeared in court the morning of the attack on charges related to the use and possible sale of methamphetamine. He had been due to face a verdict on Friday.Mass shootings in Thailand are rare, although gun ownership rates are relatively high for the region. In 2020 a soldier killed 29 people and injured dozens more in the city of Nakhon Ratchasima. Thursday's attack comes less than a month after an army officer shot dead two of his colleagues at a base in Bangkok.Additional reporting by Suchada Phoisaat</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Stephen McDonell"><Text>The idea was to have China in stable and tip-top shape when thousands of delegates gather in Beijing to usher in a historic third term in power for Xi Jinping.However, the coronavirus is not playing nicely.In recent weeks, tens of millions of people have again been confined to their homes in lockdowns across 60 towns and cities and this is bringing political pressure on the man who has become the most powerful Chinese figure since the first Communist-era leader Mao Zedong.The government's ongoing "Dynamic zero-Covid" strategy is inextricably linked to Mr Xi. Its success is his success. Its failure? Well, it would be a brave person who tried to pin it on him.Elsewhere, vaccine rollouts have meant learning to live with the virus, but this one major economy stands alone, clinging to a response designed to quash every outbreak.Strict lockdowns, mass testing, constant scanning of health codes and travel restrictions have stopped China's hospitals from being swamped. But it's come at a cost - official youth unemployment stands at 18.7%. Earlier this year it was nudging 20%. Yet even in the face of significant economic and societal pressure, the government has not really turned to the one thing which might hasten an end to the crisis. While it has been prepared to enforce strict compliance in all other areas of Covid policy, it has not pushed vaccination with anywhere near the same enthusiasm.There is no compulsion to be vaccinated. There's barely a public awareness campaign.And it has stubbornly limited vaccination to locally developed vaccines only when research shows they are not as efficient as those produced internationally. It really does look like national pride trumping science.To an extent, this superpower is getting by. Nearly a fifth of the earth's population are, in one way or another, going about their daily lives inside a giant bubble. But they are doing this while people's livelihoods are being smashed.This week, rail services out of Xinjiang were suspended and many parts of the western region including its capital Urumqi were under lockdown as officials admitted they had failed to stop the virus spreading. China's stricter lockdowns have seen widespread reports of people unable to source food and medicine - but zero-Covid is affecting people's daily lives in myriad other ways too.Three years into the crisis, this is exhausting the population.On the outskirts of Beijing, workers on modest incomes live in an area called Yanjiao because the rent is cheaper. It is on the other side of a river, just inside neighbouring Hebei province.In normal times, this wouldn't matter but in the pandemic it can mean having to run the gauntlet of roadblocks to travel from where you live to where you work.In June this year, a cluster of cases saw people living in Yanjiao prevented from entering the capital, leading to clashes between police who were enforcing the border closure and employees trying to get to work.Since then, locals have been seen paddling across the water in inflatable craft to sneak into the city.At the time of writing, the border is open but everyone entering Beijing must show their IDs which are linked to health code apps.Every morning in Yanjiao, buses can be seen lined up, stopping before they cross over, so police can board and check that everyone has a clean bill of health.The delays have made the commuters of Yanjiao seem unreliable in the eyes of employers."Many people who live in this area got fired by their companies," said one woman in the queue for the bus. "And, if they find new work, they might get treated unfairly again."We take a train from Beijing to Xi'an. Upon arrival there is a huge logjam at the station, as thousands of travellers attempt to download the local health app after coming down the stairs from the platform. Then everyone has to do a new PCR test before leaving the station.Xi'an has been a driver of inland China's economy since the years when it was the start of the old Silk Road stretching across central Asia into the Middle East and Europe. These days, the city is supposed to be one of the county's top tourist draws.We meet Addison Sun, a specialist English-language tour guide and ask him how damaging the pandemic has been for his industry"Wow! For international tourism 100%," he says. "Because no one can come to China, no one can come to Xi'an."The number of domestic tourists prepared to travel is also way down. If you are visiting somewhere and a few coronavirus cases emerge, the city can be locked down. But even if it isn't, your own city can suddenly decide not to accept you back if you've been somewhere with infections. You're stranded, sometimes for an extended period, and you have to pay for your accommodation and other needs.There have been several stay-at-home lockdowns in Xi'an, one keeping 13 million people indoors for a month. So at times the sites at the home of the famed Terracotta Warriors have been empty.As his work stopped, Addison Sun says he slipped into depression."No income. This is my lowest point," he says. "And, you know, as a man, I couldn't do anything. I'd ask my wife, 'Hi darling can you give me 100 or 200 [yuan]'?"He pulled himself out of the mire one day when looking at his eight-year-old - "I have to stand up because I should be the model. I'm the hero for my daughter" - and began posting virtual tours of Xi'an online. He's now also teaching English but longs for the day when foreign tourists return.The city's Muslim Quarter, which historians say dates back to the Tang Dynasty, should be packed with visitors. Stallholders still line the streets calling out, advertising the kebabs and sweets they have, but their restaurants have very few customers. Along the narrow lanes the tarps blow in the wind where shops have closed."I paid two years rent the day before the lockdown," says Zhang Min, who runs a little shop selling the belts and bags she makes.  "We're from the countryside. We just wanted to achieve something by ourselves."She breaks down describing how she had hoped to give her mother a better life. When does she think things will get back to normal? "It's hard to know," she says. "Outbreaks come again and again."For decades, China's economic transformation has been powered by exports, but zero-Covid means some overseas buyers are sourcing their products elsewhere because of fears of disruption to China's supply chains.Dieshiqiao in Jiangsu Province, just north of Shanghai, is a hub for the clothing industry.At a small factory, staff are hunched over their sewing machines, furiously making up for an entire season of lost production following a lockdown.The bosses had started to explain their recent challenges when a man walks in and starts secretly filming us on his phone. He then goes and speaks to the owners - the interview is off."I'm really sorry. We just can't do it," says one of the company owners. While people here are legally entitled to be interviewed, who would defy the Communist Party in this way? Five reasons why China's economy is in troubleBefore the pandemic, China's growth was around 6%. Its most recent GDP figure was 0.4%. The local government knows that zero-Covid is tanking the economy and doesn't want anyone speaking about it.In a small shop selling items for bedding, a woman tells us their sales are down by half.Then another woman suddenly appears in the shop, posing as a customer. "Hey what are you talking about?" she asks in an effort to appear genuinely curious.After we leave, she returns and questions the shop owners.One of the architects of the policy which has stopped the coronavirus from ripping through China is Professor Liang Wannian, head of the government's Covid expert panel.When we speak to him, he acknowledges that China's home-grown vaccines are not as effective at stopping infection as had been hoped, but says they do prevent severe illness and death.When does he thinks zero-Covid might come to an end? "It's hard to say," he replies. "Because one thing I am sure of is, we won't kill the virus any time soon. We're waiting for more effective medicines and more effective vaccines."A key blockage standing in the way of re-opening is the significant body of people who don't think it's safe to be vaccinated.The Chinese authorities are prepared to separate elderly grandparents and young children from their families and force them into quarantine centres or lock down entire cities for months, but vaccination doesn't feel like a priority. Some Chinese doctors have even been telling their patients that they should not get the shots. As a result many analysts don't believe that official statistics accurately reflect the true level of vaccination.Professor Liang knows there's a problem in this area."Many old people have underlying diseases. They reckon it won't be safe to get vaccinated. But in fact, it is safe. We need to get this message across," he says. It's a significant admission."China has been working on it but there's a lot of room for progress," he adds.Could zero-Covid be lifted after the Communist Party Congress in mid-October? "It's hard for me to answer that," he says with an awkward laugh. "I'm just a scholar".China has successfully minimised the impact of the virus - and if it re-opened tomorrow, the disease would spread like wildfire.But, at the moment, it feels like the government is just kicking the can down the road. Remaining cut off from the outside world is coming at a cost.There are no easy options, but China can't go on like this forever.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Paul Kirby"><Text>Across Europe, governments have been grappling with ways of protecting their consumers from rising energy bills, because the market has been hit by Russia's war in Ukraine.At an EU summit in Prague on Friday, 27 European leaders are being asked to back a cap on gas prices, even though several are wary of the idea.Fifteen countries want a Europe-wide limit imposed on the wholesale price of gas, while European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen agrees there should be some kind of temporary price cap.The recent explosions in Germany's Nord Stream 1 pipeline in the Baltic Sea were a clear illustration of how little European countries can now rely on Russian gas imports. Germany's gas network regulator has already warned that consumers are using more than in previous years and Italy has imposed limits on hours and temperatures for heating many buildings.Some countries warn that capping wholesale prices could affect the security of Europe's gas supply, as it would boost consumption. EU member states have already agreed other measures to protect consumers, with windfall taxes on surplus profits made by fossil fuel companies and a levy on excess profits made by non-gas electricity producers. They have also agreed on a mandatory 5% cut on peak electricity consumption.It's a start, but it's not long-term and not a structural reform. So what possible alternatives are there and could an EU price cap work?Many governments have already introduced national ceilings on the prices consumers pay for units of energy. But capping wholesale prices across the EU would be a major departure, and there are various ways of doing it.Ursula von der Leyen has proposed a series of measures to "dampen" the price paid for imports that she believes would not put supplies at risk.One of them involves negotiating a "corridor of prices" for imports from suppliers such as Norway and the US. Instead of a fixed price cap, an upper and lower price limit below current rates would be agreed with the countries involved.Norway has become the EU's biggest gas supplier since Russia launched its war - but Oslo believes imposing a maximum on wholesale gas prices will not solve Europe's biggest problem of having too little gas.Four EU countries want a "dynamic corridor" which would apply to all wholesale gas sales, not just those agreed with key suppliers. Poland, Belgium, Italy and Greece say a central value would be set and could be updated regularly in relation to the price of crude oil. The price could deviate from that value, perhaps by 5%.The Greek prime minister believes an upper limit that is not artificially low would not destabilise markets: "With high enough prices, suppliers will still send their gas to Europe, and consumers will still have reason to reduce their demand," says Kyriakos Mitsotakis.The head of the European Commission believes it is important to stop EU countries trying to outbid each other, as that only sends prices higher. She foresees joint purchasing of gas across a European energy platform, similar to how the EU bought Covid-19 vaccines. Another idea is to impose a temporary price cap on imported gas used to generate electricity. The advantage here is that this has already been tried in Spain and Portugal since June.The Iberian cap brought down the costs of wholesale electricity and saved households an average of 24.4% on their bills, according to one study, but apparently also led to increased demand. It is not clear if it could work more broadly.Italy wants to focus on replacing the existing Dutch-based TTF market hub, where prices have become increasingly volatile. Critics say the hub cannot properly assess the market value of LNG (liquefied natural gas) and can add 30% to the price of a commodity fast becoming increasingly important in Europe. EU energy commissioner Kadri Simson says work has begun on developing a "complementary EU price index" for LNG, but she has also raised the prospect of imposing a price cap purely on Russian gas. Until that alternative benchmark is up and running, Ursula von der Leyen suggests imposing a price limit on the TTF, to make clear that the EU is not ready to pay "whatever price" for gas.Last week, the German government forged ahead with a €200bn (£174bn) package to shield its businesses and consumers, bigger than any other EU country can afford.It went down very badly with several European partners. "We cannot divide ourselves according to the space in our national budgets, we need solidarity," complained Italy's outgoing prime minister, Mario Draghi.Part of the big German announcement is a gas price "brake", which would mean Berlin subsidising the actual market price. That is very different from a cap on the price paid to suppliers that each EU country would sign up to.The main risk, as European think tank Bruegel puts it, is that the German package could disrupt a European level playing field, with German business having a far greater chance of surviving the energy crisis than, say, Italian business.Two European commissioners, Paolo Gentiloni and Thierry Breton, said the German action raised the issue of how other countries with lesser resources could support their businesses and households. They want an EU-wide scheme similar to the low-cost loans provided in the Covid pandemic.French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire says Europe should respond with a lasting strategy that focuses on the principle of fair competition: "What is at stake is the competitiveness of our companies, the competitiveness of our industries."The problem for the EU is that it has an internal energy market with 27 states having a variety of energy mixes and they have to agree on a solution that works for all of them.Although the EU's storage facilities are about 90% full, the lack of Russian supplies means refilling them will prove hard. The International Energy Agency says if demand is not cut and Russian supplies are not replenished, then levels could drop to between 5% and 20%. It says EU gas demand will have to fall this winter by 9% on previous years to keep storage levels above a quarter."The most promising measure to actually bring down the average price is still the reduction of peak consumption," says Estonian minister Riina Sikkut.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Michael Dempsey"><Text>South Central Los Angeles is an area that has been tarnished with a troubled image. Both Hollywood and real-life crime stories have seen to that.Carlos Oyarbide, who teaches English Language Development in South Central LA, is all too familiar with its reputation as a regular visitor. "There's truth in the violent stereotype, but I choose to teach there. It is an immigrant hub with a great sense of loyalty and community. And that community has an entrepreneurial spirit."That spirit has been harnessed at Mr Oyarbide's school, Nava College Preparatory Academy. The school was the trial site for a scheme that has pitched using the metaverse to help teach English to students with a limited grasp of the language. The term metaverse is used to describe a series of virtual reality worlds that can be accessed through a browser or virtual reality (VR) headset.The idea behind the scheme is to harness the power of VR technology to bypass traditional teaching methods and plunge students into a world of possibility in a virtual universe.The idea that VR can be used to boost learning isn't new. In 2020, a study by business consultants PwC found that through the use of VR students could learn up to four times faster than in a traditional class setting.However, the falling price of VR headsets has now made them a more affordable teaching aid.For Mr Oyarbide, the possibility of sharpened focus among his easily distracted students had huge appeal. "I've been teaching for 12 years. If kids can figure out anything it is how not to pay attention! I wanted to try something different, do normal learning from books for one period and then switch to VR." In doing this, he discovered that a VR environment swept away the inhibitions of many of his students wrestling with learning a new language.He says the technique helped them practise their language skills without embarrassment.Typical tasks performed by his students inside the VR classroom involved building a shop while working out the English language required for signage and advertising.Students would usually use the VR equipment for two or three hours a week."They can feel intimidated speaking in English, but when it's just them and a VR avatar that's completely different." Despite the positive impact VR has had on his teaching methods, Mr Oyarbide is not a starry-eyed convert to the avalanche of metaverse hype typified by Facebook's rebranding as Meta.He says there is still great advantages to a traditional classroom setting. "The old approach to teaching through books does not go away. And you're not going to wear a headset for four hours a day. But it does allow you to reduce teacher talk and create a tangible space for a student's confidence to grow."Meanwhile, Marco Vargas's parents moved to Los Angeles from Guatemala. "I'm a first-generation everything - first-generation American and first-generation high school graduate. In high school I learnt how to navigate the education system and how to use resources by myself."As part of the first cohort to go through Nava, he missed the more modern VR headsets that are now used.Instead, Mr Vargas had a more stripped-down VR experience, using a cardboard viewer attached to a smartphone and Google software.Nevertheless, he says that his high school's embrace of technology was important for his own academic development.The immersive aspect of VR learning appeals to him, but he can also be critical of how his younger generation can take technology for granted after having it at their fingertips for so long. "Yes, we are digital natives, but we lack discipline. We fall prey to distractions." Proving that he could overcome any distraction, Mr Vargas won a Fulbright scholarship to study at Dartmouth, a prestigious Ivy League university.More technology of business:How to make movies without a huge carbon footprintHigh and low-tech ways to solve India's water crisisAre we falling in love with robots?Can drumming reconnect you to your colleagues?How graphene's superpowers could soon be unleashedToday, he works for Exponential Destiny, a non-profit organisation dedicated to introducing students at schools in disadvantaged areas to emerging technologies. It was Exponential Destiny that provided the VR headsets to Nava College.Marcus Shingles runs the firm. He was a high-flying business consultant at top-tier firms where he demonstrated new technologies to business leaders, and happily contrasts himself with his students."I'm a rich white guy," he says. Now, he is helping to plot routes into technology for teenagers who had previously never considered that such a career could be possible for them. "It's clear that the internet is evolving, so we take the time students have invested in mastering platforms like TikTok and show them that developing products in the metaverse doesn't require hard coding."He says the falling price of VR headsets is a chance to make the technology more accessible.  This approach to embedding metaverse technologies in teaching attracts students who don't see themselves as tech-oriented.Many of the students that have gone through Exponential Destiny are hired to help out at other schools and expand the scheme.Samantha Aguilar Araujo, the daughter of Salvadoran parents and the first in her family to attend high school, is one of them."I didn't consider myself a tech person, I'm definitely more on the creative side, but I heard about a new class and took it to see what it was like."She became enamoured with a virtual approach to building computing programs that bypasses traditional coding techniques that alienate many of those who aren't technologically adept.Fuelled by artificial intelligence this VR method is often referred to as no-code coding.More students in the US and overseas are likely to see these VR techniques in the coming months.Exponential Destiny has projects running in four schools at the moment, with plans to introduce the system to another two in the US and four schools outside the US.Back at Nava College a former pupil, Juan Felix, has returned to take a class of 18 students with limited English through the technology maze.His students discover routes into college or a career in a VR world where they can pull together the elements of covering letters and job application forms."It is crazy. They're not speaking English as a first language and they've not been exposed to the technology before, but despite these barriers they learn very quickly," he says.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Yogita Limaye "><Text>On the morning of 30 September, 20-year-old Mariam was scrambling to get to the Kaaj education centre, in Kabul's Dasht-e-Barchi area, which is largely home to the city's ethnic Hazara minority. Wahidah, her closest friend, had called her early that morning and said "Why are you still asleep? Wake up, we have the exam today." It was a practice test in preparation for Concor, a university entrance exam in Afghanistan.While Mariam was on her way to the centre, Wahidah had called again to ask her to hurry, saying she'd kept a seat for her. At 7:15am, Mariam had just arrived at the centre when she heard a string of gunfire. "Then there was the most terrible explosion I've ever heard," she recalls. "I saw boys running out of the centre, jumping over its boundary wall. A few seconds later, I saw girls running out too. Many of them were injured, blood on their faces and clothes."Mariam was not allowed into the centre but she refused to go home. She kept waiting for Wahidah to come outside. She never did. Wahidah was among the 45 female students who were killed in the suicide attack at the private coaching institute on 30 September. "She was like my sister. We shared all our secrets," Mariam says. "Wahidah didn't miss a single day of the preparatory course. Whether it rained or snowed or there was a flood, even though she lived farthest away from centre, she was always there."On that Friday morning, Wahidah's father Mohammad Amir Hyderi had left to go to his shop early. "I didn't even see her that day," he says. "She was the hero of our family, my angel. She always excelled at school. And even in a practice exam last month, she was the top scorer among 650 students. But it wasn't just that she was clever. She was so well-behaved and devout that everyone in our community loved her. I don't know why God chose me to be her father, but then why did he take her away so soon?"For hours after the explosion, Mohammad and Mariam went to several hospitals looking for Wahidah. "The Taliban were not letting us in. Finally at the Ali Jinnah hospital, Mariam slipped inside," Mohammad says, weeping as he recalled that day. "She came out crying and screaming a few minutes later, saying she'd seen Wahidah's body."  As Afghanistan's economy crumbles, it's difficult for Mohammad to pay for private lessons, especially through his meagre earnings selling vegetables. "I would save wherever I could. I'd buy less food and go without some things to pay for Wahidah and my other children's education," he said.Since the Taliban seized power last August, girls have been barred from going to secondary school in most of Afghanistan, including Kabul. Wahidah had finished secondary school last year, but was worried about her younger sisters' education. "She had started teaching her sisters all the subjects taught at school," Mohammad says.With restrictions on the rights and freedoms of women increasing under the Taliban, it has been a time of despair for millions of young women and girls in the country. "Whenever I used to feel hopeless or couldn't find the motivation to study, I would end up missing classes. Wahidah would say to me, 'I'll help you, don't worry, but please come for class,'" Mariam says.  For many girls who would have been in secondary school, the private education centre was a way out of the emptiness that filled their days. Omulbanin Asghari, 17, dreamed of going to Harvard University to study political science or economics. Barred from school in her final year, she studied as much as she could at home, and also took courses at Kaaj. "She wanted to make sure that she didn't miss out, and that her knowledge was at the level of a final year student," her brother Mukhtar Modabber said. "She used to read a lot. She was always surrounded by books. And she'd also exercise every day to keep fit."Mukhtar was also Omulbanin's teacher. He has been teaching physics and mathematics at Kaaj centre for 10 years. "Omul would always smile and joke with me and say 'Lala (brother), I'm going to go abroad and study, and then come back and work for the rights of women. You'll see - one day I'll be more famous than you,'" he says.  On 23 March, the Taliban had announced that secondary schools would reopen for girls. Omulbanin went to school, but she and her classmates were sent back in just an hour. The Taliban had rolled back their decision. "It's the worst memory I have of her. I was the first person she called. She couldn't stop crying," Mukhtar said. "Since then she would get upset every morning when school would normally have started, and in the afternoon when it would have ended."On the morning of the attack, Omulbanin was in a cheerful mood. "She was very happy. She had breakfast early, and left for the centre earlier than usual," Mukhtar said. He was at home when he received a call from his younger brother, who also works at the centre. Mukhtar was told their sister had been injured. He ran to the centre where he found out that she had been killed.The youngest of five siblings, Omulbanin, Mukhtar says, was the most loved child of the family. "We are devastated. My mother has a heart ailment, and she's in a very bad condition since Omul died."Afghanistan has seen numerous attacks on schools and places of education, in particular those dominated by the Hazara community. No group has so far claimed responsibility for last Friday's bombing, but the Islamic State Khorasan Province or ISKP - the regional affiliate of Islamic State - has claimed that it was behind earlier attacks. "Each attack affects the morale of all students, but especially girls. It scares them, and us," Mukhtar said. "But despite the danger, I will continue teaching. The people behind this violence are scared that their future will be at risk if Afghanistan's younger generation is educated. This week, I've lost my sister and so many of my other students. But I have to remember that hundreds are still alive and want an education. I don't want their future to be dark."Wahidah's father would often tell her to stop going attending classes at the centre because it was too dangerous. "She wouldn't say anything to me but she'd tell her mother that she wouldn't stop because she wanted to study medicine and serve her country," Mohammad said. 'I am just waiting for the centre to reopen and I will go back to my course. I used to need motivation to attend classes, but now it's a commitment and responsibility for me," Mariam says. "I have to continue my education, for Wahidah, for Nazanin, Shabnam, Nargis, for Samira, for tens of my friends who were killed. One day, we will win."She isn't sure when that day will come or if it will happen in her lifetime but she is certain it will happen eventually: "Maybe more of us will be killed, but we will definitely win." </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Sam Cabral &amp; Amund Trellevik "><Text>America's leaders are old and growing older. As part of a new series that looks abroad for inspiration on how to fix flaws in the US political system, we ask whether Norway's young MPs have the answer.Democratic President Joe Biden, 79, is the country's oldest ever leader. His chief rival, Republican Donald Trump, is 76.In the US Congress, the median age is the highest in two decades. Baby boomers dominate and millennials represent barely 6% of the body.Midterm elections this November will reshuffle the makeup of the legislative branch of government - but many of its oldest faces will remain.The problem is a structural one, according to experts.Congress prizes seniority, with the longest-tenured lawmakers typically first in line for leadership posts, plum committee assignments and other forms of influence. Name recognition and visibility gives incumbents a smoother path to re-election.Making matters worse are the age requirements. You must be at least 25 to join the House of Representatives, the lower chamber of Congress, and at least 30 to qualify for the Senate.Meanwhile, young hopefuls face financial barriers to seeking office with fewer resources, less access to wealth and obstacles like childcare costs or student debt.What's it like being elected in your 20s?How Pelosi rose to the top - and stayed thereSome believe youth under-representation has had a profound impact on US democracy. "Lived experience informs legislative priorities," says Amanda Litman, co-founder of Run for Something, a group that supports progressive candidates under 40. She claims that a lack of progress on issues young people care about, such as gun violence and climate change, have fed "a cycle of cynicism" and disengagement.Norway has the highest proportion of young politicians in the world, according to data published by the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), with 13.6% under 30. In the US, it's 0.23% in the House of Representatives and zero in the Senate.It's a similar story with average age - only the UK's House of Lords and Canada's upper chamber are "older" than the US Senate. Norway's average age is 18 years younger.Maren Grøthe became the youngest national politician in Norway's history when she was elected to its national assembly, the Storting, aged just 20 last year.Born just a few months before the terrorist attacks on 9/11 in 2001, she is one of 23 representatives under the age of 30, up by six since 2013."I really enjoy it. This is a job with great responsibilities, and I feel those responsibilities every day," Grøthe tells the BBC.The average age in the Storting is 46 and has remained so since the end of the 1990s, because while a record number of young people are joining, they are also working longer. The oldest is 77.Jonny Lang of the IPU which collects the global data says it's crucial that parliaments look more like the countries they represent. And having young people's perspectives leads to better policies. Despite her young age, Grøthe had already served two years as a local politician in her home municipality when she was elected to the national assembly.She has a wide range of tasks.  A recent week began with a parliamentary committee trip to Germany and ended with her back home to attend the opening of a new football pitch outside Trondheim in central Norway where she lives with her boyfriend.The workdays are long, and the business trips are many. Every week she commutes to her apartment in the capital Oslo.She describes herself as an "ordinary Norwegian youth" who likes both partying with friends and hiking in the mountains. But since she was elected to the Storting, there has been far less time for such activities.Grøthe believes that having so many young politicians in the Storting brings many advantages, with  different cultures and ages better represented. "We young people have life experience, but in a different way. We need to develop policies for everyone in the country."But what can she contribute to politics that a 55-year-old can't?"I have completely different perspectives and knowledge on being young today. More and more young people struggle with their mental health. I have also just finished my high school education, which is useful in the education committee in the national assembly," she says.The electoral system is one reason Norway has the world's youngest parliament, believes Ragnhild Louise Muriaas, professor of political science at the University of Bergen. Several people from the same party can be elected in the same district. "This means that an older and well-known man may be the top candidate, but unknown, young women may be nominated for the next positions on the list and be sure to be elected," she says. In France, UK and the US it's winner takes all and parties feel they cannot "afford" to top the lists with young, inexperienced candidates.The youth wings of the political parties also play a part, she adds. These organisations are a strong political force, often with opinions opposing those of the parent party.There are possible drawbacks too, says Muriaas. She is looking into whether young politicians disappear more quickly from politics. The lack of life and work experiences before being elected is another open question.The Norway model has not been replicated in the US, but researchers at Tufts University's Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE) suggest some developments in recent years may boost youth representation.They argue that while political parties do not typically have a youth strategy, youth organisations - particularly on the Republican side - have garnered more visibility and funding. They also point out the growing adoption of electoral measures such as ranked-choice voting, where voters rank candidates based on preference, can benefit young candidates.But because party gatekeepers often suppress young candidates, the young and civically-engaged need to be actively encouraged or financially supported to run for office, beginning at the local level, says CIRCLE fellow Sara Suzuki.Two members of Generation Z - a Democrat and Republican apiece - will appear on midterm ballots this November for the first time. If they win, they will chip away at older generations' dominance in Congress.As Americans prepare to vote we will be visiting countries around the world looking for answers to challenges facing the US political systemWe will be tackling subjects like fake news, gridlock in Congress, lack of female representation and low turnoutReporters in Bolivia, Finland, Australia and Switzerland will explain how these issues are handled where they live</Text></Article><Article paper="cnn" author="[{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;Person&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Yoonjung Seo&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.cnn.com/profiles/yoonjung-seo&quot;},{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;Person&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Caitlin Hu&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;Person&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Eric Cheung&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.cnn.com/profiles/eric-cheung&quot;},{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;Person&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Brad Lendon&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.cnn.com/profiles/brad-lendon&quot;}]"><Text>The United States and South Korea launched four missiles off the east coast of the Korean Peninsula on Wednesday morning local time, according to South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff. The test was the allies’ second exercise in under 24 hours, following a provocative test-launch Tuesday morning by neighboring North Korea, which fired a ballistic missile without warning over Japan in a significant escalation of its weapons testing program.  The US and South Korea initially responded to the provocation with a precision bombing exercise on Tuesday, which involved a South Korean F-15K fighter jet firing two air-to-surface munitions at a virtual target in a firing range west of the Korean Peninsula, per the South Korean Joint Chiefs.  The allies typically respond to missile tests by North Korea with military exercises. Wednesday’s launch included four ATACMS missiles, the statement by the South Korean Joint Chiefs said. Also known as Army Tactical Missile Systems, such weapons are surface-to-surface missiles that can fly around 200 miles (320 kilometers). According to John Kirby, the National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications, the launch was designed to demonstrate that the US and its allies have “the military capabilities at the ready to respond to provocations by the North.”  “This is not the first time we’ve done this in response to provocations by the North to make sure that we can demonstrate our own capabilities,” Kirby told CNN’s Pamela Brown on the “The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer.” “We want to see the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, (North Korean leader Kim Jong Un) hasn’t shown an inclination to move in that direction, quite frankly he’s moving in the opposite direction by continuing to conduct these missile tests which are violations of security council resolutions,” he added. On Tuesday, the US and Japan also conducted a joint response to the North Korean launch, with US Marine Corps and Japan Air Self-Defense Force fighter jets flying over the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea. Following a 25-minute phone call with US President Joe Biden, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said North Korea’s latest launch posed “a grave challenge to peace and the stability of Japan, the region and the international community” and that Biden shared this view completely.  Analysts say there’s little the US and its allies can do to stop Kim’s relentless weapons buildup.  “The North Koreans are in no mood to talk. They’re in the mood of testing and blowing things off,” said Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Project at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies. Failed US-North Korea summits during the Trump administration have led Kim to believe he can gain nothing from talks, Lewis said. Since 2019 negotiations with former US President Donald Trump were cut short with no agreement, the North Korean leader has laid out a program to develop missiles with nuclear capability – and he’s following that timetable, Lewis added. “North Korea is going to keep conducting missile tests until the current round of modernization is done. I don’t think a nuclear (test) explosion is far behind,” Lewis said. Kirby, the National Security Council spokesperson, said North Korea is making progress. Every time the Kim regime launches a weapon, “They learn, they get better, they get more capable,” he said in an interview with Fox News on Tuesday. Ankit Panda, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said North Korea appeared set on a course to develop nuclear weapons. “Denuclearization is now I think in the dustbin of history as a failed policy,” he said. “There is simply no practical plan at this point, especially in the short term, to bring North Korea to the negotiating table and to pursue denuclearization.”</Text></Article><Article paper="cnn" author="[{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;Person&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Story by Reuters&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;&quot;}]"><Text>The mediator sent to Burkina Faso by West Africa’s main political and economic bloc ECOWAS, Mahamadou Issoufou, on Tuesday said he was satisfied by a meeting with the country’s new military leader Ibrahim Traore. Issoufou added that the 15-member bloc would continue accompanying Burkina Faso’s transition to constitutional rule after the country was hit by its second military takeover this year. ECOWAS had repeatedly urged the junta that took control on Friday to respect a timetable agreed with their predecessors to return to constitutional rule by July 2024. “We had very profound exchanges. Very frank exchanges,” Issoufou told reporters after meeting religious leaders and Traore in the capital Ouagadougou. “I can assure you that ECOWAS will remain with the people of Burkina Faso … and the difficult challenge they face,” he added.  Burkina Faso’s government released a statement saying the meeting took place but provided no further comments. The meeting took place against a backdrop of protests in Ouagadougou that forced the delegation to stay at the airport rather than travel to a conference hall in the city center for security reasons, a diplomatic source said. Dozens of demonstrators blocked access to the conference center on Tuesday morning to prevent the meeting from taking place, a Reuters reporter said. The crowds remained relatively small and peaceful. But they followed violent anti-France protests over the weekend that flared after Traore said Damiba had taken refuge in a French military base, which France denied. Some accused the bloc of siding with France, Burkina Faso’s former colonizer, and doing little to help the country tackle a rampant Islamist insurgency that has killed hundreds, displaced thousands, and pushed besieged towns in the north to the brink of famine. Frustrations over growing insecurity spurred both the first military takeover in January and the latest coup. ECOWAS is struggling to facilitate a return to constitutional order in Burkina Faso, Chad, Guinea, and Mali, all of which have seen coups since 2020.</Text></Article><Article paper="cnn" author="[{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;Person&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Masrur Jamaluddin&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;Person&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Heather Chen&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;Person&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Jake Kwon&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;&quot;}]"><Text>Fans attempting to escape the chaos that erupted at Indonesia’s Kanjuruhan Stadium last Saturday became trapped after security failed to open multiple exit gates, according to the national football association, contributing to the crowd crush in which at least 131 people died. Security forces are facing mounting anger over their role in the disaster, amid questions over whether officers used excessive force in attempting to remove fans from the field following Arema FC’s 3-2 defeat against visitors Persebaya Surabaya. The disaster, one of the worst in the sport’s history, saw a number of the 42,000 Arema FC fans clash with police, prompting security forces to fire tear gas into enclosed areas of the stadium. Most of the deaths – including 33 children – are believed to have occurred as panicked fans attempted to flee the choking smoke, triggering a crush at the exits.   Indonesian police have launched an investigation into the use of tear gas at the game in the city of Malang, leading to the suspension of nine officers from East Java province.  But amid allegations of mismanagement by both police and the game’s organizers, survivors of the tragedy are demanding answers. “We were all disappointed with the match result but there was no (sign of) violence or chaos until police started firing tear gas,” said Arema fan Toni Lestari Widodo, 62.  It only “escalated the situation” and made it worse, he said. “The police overreacted in their handling of the situation. I really don’t understand why they did it. There was really no point for violence (on their part).”  ‘A big mistake’ Andi Hariyanto, 32, lost multiple members of his family in the tragedy, including his wife, two teenage daughters and nephew.  He had remained behind with his family in the stands to avoid joining crowds rushing for the exits.  Riot police on the field fired tear gas at supporters in the stands, he said. “It was a big mistake,” he said. “Don’t they know that there were many women and children who were also watching the match? I still don’t understand. What did we do to make them want to shoot us?”  Hariyanto managed to escape the ensuing crush along with his his 2-year-old son, Gian.  His wife, Gebi Asta Putri Purwoko, and their two daughters, Natasya Debi Ramadani, 14, and Naila Debi Anggraini, 12, did not.  At around midnight, he returned to the stadium, where dozens of body bags were lying on the ground. “One by one, I opened the covers to find my family,” he said. “Then I found Natasya and Naila, lying there close to each other,” he said, fighting back tears. “I can’t remember how many bodies I checked to find them but when I finished it all, I still couldn’t find my wife.”  Locked exit gates In a statement Tuesday, the Football Association of Indonesia said it had permanently removed the security official responsible for regulating the stadium’s exits. It said some of the gates remained locked during the disaster owing to a failure to properly communicate orders.  “The doors should have been open but were closed,” said Erwin Tobing, chief of the association’s discipline commission. There are 14 gates at the stadium in total.  Safety rules and measures state that gates must be unlocked 10 minutes before the end of a match.  On the night of the disaster, several gates were still locked minutes after the referee blew the final whistle, the association noted. Spokesperson Ahmad Riyadh also blamed the shortage of workers, saying that “only a few guards” had been on hand to open the gates.  All Indonesian soccer league matches have been suspended under orders of President Joko Widodo, as official investigations are underway. On Wednesday, Widodo said he will order a “total audit” of soccer stadiums across the country in an effort to prevent any further tragedies. </Text></Article><Article paper="cnn" author="[{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;Person&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Manveena Suri&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;Person&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Kathleen Magramo&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.cnn.com/profiles/kathleen-magramo&quot;}]"><Text>At least four people were killed and 28 people remain missing after an avalanche hit a group of mountaineers in the Indian Himalayas on Tuesday, according to an Indian mountaineering organization.

The question of a recession is no longer if, but when. Over the past week, the pulse of those flashing red lights quickened as markets grappled with the reality — once speculative, now certain — that the Federal Reserve will press on with its most aggressive monetary tightening campaign in decades to wring inflation from the US economy.  Even if that means triggering a recession. And even if it comes at the expense of consumers and businesses far beyond US borders.   There’s now a 98% chance of a global recession, according to research firm Ned Davis, which brings some sobering historical credibility to the table. The firm’s recession probability reading has only been this high twice before — in 2008 and 2020.   When economists warn of a downturn, they’re typically basing their assessment on a variety of indicators.  Let’s unpack five key trends:  The mighty US dollar  The US dollar plays an outsized role in the global economy and international finance. And right now, it is stronger than it’s been in two decades.  The simplest explanation comes back to the Fed.  When the US central bank raises interest rates, as it has been doing since March, it makes the dollar more appealing to investors around the world.  In any economic climate, the dollar is seen as a safe place to park your money. In a tumultuous climate — a global pandemic, say, or a war in Eastern Europe — investors have even more incentive to purchase dollars, usually in the form of US government bonds. While a strong dollar is a nice perk for Americans traveling abroad, it creates headaches for just about everyone else.  The value of the UK pound, the euro, China’s yuan and Japan’s yen, among many others, has tumbled. That makes it more expensive for those nations to import essential items like food and fuel.  In response, central banks that are already fighting pandemic-induced inflation wind up raising rates higher and faster to shore up the value of their own currencies.  The dollar’s strength also creates destabilizing effects for Wall Street, as many of the S&amp;P 500 companies do business around the world. By one estimate from Morgan Stanley, each 1% rise in the dollar index has a negative 0.5% impact on S&amp;P 500 earnings. America’s economic engine stalls The No. 1 driver of the world’s largest economy is shopping. And America’s shoppers are tired.  After more than a year of rising prices on just about everything, with wages not keeping up, consumers have pulled back.  “The hardship caused by inflation means that consumers are dipping into their savings,” EY Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco said in a note Friday. The personal saving rate in August remained unchanged at only 3.5%, Daco said — near its lowest rate since 2008, and well below its pre-Covid level of around 9%. Once again, the reason behind the pullback has a lot to do with the Fed.  Interest rates have risen at a historic pace, pushing mortgage rates to their highest level in more than a decade and making it harder for businesses to grow. Eventually, the Fed’s rate hikes should broadly bring costs down. But in the meantime, consumers are getting a one-two punch of high borrowing rates and high prices, especially when it comes to necessities like food and housing.  Americans opened their wallets during the 2020 lockdowns, which powered the economy out of its brief-but-severe pandemic recession. Since then, government aid has evaporated and inflation has taken root, pushing prices up at their fastest rate in 40 years and sapping consumers’ spending power.  Corporate America tightens its belt Business has been booming across industries for the bulk of the pandemic era, even with historically high inflation eating into profits. That is thanks (once again) to the tenacity of American shoppers, as businesses were largely able to pass on their higher costs to consumers to cushion profit margins.  But the earnings bonanza may not last. In mid-September, one company whose fortunes serve as a kind of economic bellwether gave investors a shock.  FedEx, which operates in more than 200 countries, unexpectedly revised its outlook, warning that demand was softening, and earnings were likely to plunge more than 40%.  In an interview, its CEO was asked whether he believes the slowdown was a sign of a looming global recession.  “I think so,” he responded. “These numbers, they don’t portend very well.” FedEx isn’t alone. On Tuesday, Apple’s stock fell after Bloomberg reported the company was scrapping plans to increase iPhone 14 production after demand came in below expectations. And just ahead of the holiday season, when employers would normally ramp up hiring, the mood is now more cautious. “We’ve not seen the normal September uptick in companies posting for temporary help,” said Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter. “Companies are hanging back and waiting to see what conditions hold.”  Welcome to bear territory Wall Street has been hit with whiplash, and stocks are now on track for their worst year since 2008 — in case anyone needs yet another scary historical comparison. But last year was a very different story. Equity markets thrived in 2021, with the S&amp;P 500 soaring 27%, thanks to a torrent of cash pumped in by the Federal Reserve, which unleashed a double-barreled monetary-easing policy in the spring of 2020 to keep financial markets from crumbling.  The party lasted until early 2022. But as inflation set in, the Fed began to take away the proverbial punch bowl, raising interest rates and unwinding its bond-buying mechanism that had propped up the market.  The hangover has been brutal. The S&amp;P 500, the broadest measure of Wall Street — and the index responsible for the bulk of Americans’ 401(k)s — is down nearly 24% for the year. And it’s not alone. All three major US indexes are in bear markets — down at least 20% from their most recent highs. In an unfortunate twist, bond markets, typically a safe haven for investors when stocks and other assets decline, are also in a tailspin.  Once again, blame the Fed.  Inflation, along with the steep rise in interest rates by the central bank, has pushed bond prices down, which causes bond yields (aka the return an investor gets for their loan to the government) to go up.  On Wednesday, the yield on the 10-year US Treasury briefly surpassed 4%, hitting its highest level in 14 years. That surge was followed by a steep drop in response to the Bank of England’s intervention in its own spiraling bond market — amounting to tectonic moves in a corner of the financial world that is designed to be steady, if not downright boring.  European bond yields are also spiking as central banks follow the Fed’s lead in raising rates to shore up their own currencies.  Bottom line: There are few safe places for investors to put their money right now, and that’s unlikely to change until global inflation gets under control and central banks loosen their grips.  War, soaring prices and radical policies collide  Nowhere is the collision of economic, financial, and political calamities more painfully visible than in the United Kingdom.  Like the rest of the world, the UK has struggled with surging prices that are largely attributable to the colossal shock of Covid-19, followed by the trade disruptions created by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. As the West cut off imports of Russian natural gas, energy prices have soared and supplies have dwindled.    Those events were bad enough on their own.  But then, just over a week ago, the freshly installed government of Prime Minister Liz Truss announced a sweeping tax-cut plan that economists from both ends of the political spectrum have decried as unorthodox at best, diabolical at worst. In short, the Truss administration said it would slash taxes for all Britons to encourage spending and investment and, in theory, soften the blow of a recession. But the tax cuts aren’t funded, which means the government must take on debt to finance them.  That decision set off a panic in financial markets and put Downing Street in a standoff with its independent central bank, the Bank of England. Investors around the world sold off UK bonds in droves, plunging the pound to its lowest level against the dollar in nearly 230 years. As in, since 1792, when Congress made the US dollar legal tender. The BOE staged an emergency intervention to buy up UK bonds on Wednesday and restore order in financial markets. It stemmed the bleeding, for now. But the ripple effects of the Trussonomics turmoil is spreading far beyond the offices of bond traders.  Britons, who are already in a cost-of-living crisis, with inflation at 10% — the highest of any G7 economy — are now panicking over higher borrowing costs that could force millions of homeowners’ monthly mortgage payments to go up by hundreds or even thousands of pounds.  The upshot While the consensus is that a global recession is likely sometime in 2023, it’s impossible to predict how severe it will be or how long it will last. Not every recession is as painful as the 2007-09 Great Recession, but every recession is, of course, painful. Some economies, particularly the United States, with its strong labor market and resilient consumers, will be able to withstand the blow better than others.  “We are in uncharted waters in the months ahead,” wrote economists at the World Economic Forum in a report this week.  “The immediate outlook for the global economy and for much of the world’s population is dark,” they continued, adding that the challenges “will test the resilience of economies and societies and exact a punishing human toll.”  But there are some silver linings, they said. Crises force transformations that can ultimately improve standards of living and make economies stronger. “Businesses have to change. This has been the story since the pandemic started,” said Rima Bhatia, an economic adviser for Gulf International Bank. “Businesses no longer can continue on the path that they were at. That’s the opportunity and that’s the silver lining.”  — CNN Business’ Julia Horowitz, Anna Cooban, Mark Thompson, Matt Egan and Chris Isidore contributed reporting.</Text></Article><Article paper="cnn" author="[{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;Person&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Reuters&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;&quot;}]"><Text>OPEC+ will consider an oil output cut of more than a million barrels per day (bpd) next week, OPEC sources said on Sunday, in what would be the biggest move yet since the COVID-19 pandemic to address oil market weakness. The meeting will take place on Oct. 5 against the backdrop of falling oil prices and months of severe market volatility which prompted top OPEC+ producer, Saudi Arabia, to say the group could cut production. News of the consideration drove up oil’s price during Asia trading hours. Brent crude, the global benchmark, was up 3.28% as of 7:49p ET Sunday. OPEC+, which combines OPEC countries and allies such as Russia, has refused to raise output to lower oil prices despite pressure from major consumers, including the United States, to help the global economy. Prices have nevertheless fallen sharply in the last month due to fears about the global economy and a rally in the US dollar after the Federal Reserves raised rates. A significant production cut is poised to anger the United States, which has been putting pressure on Saudi Arabia to continue pumping more to help oil prices soften further and reduce revenues for Russia as the West seeks to punish Moscow for sending troops to Ukraine. The West accuses Russia of invading Ukraine, but the Kremlin calls it a special military operation. Saudi Arabia has not condemned Moscow’s actions amid difficult relations with the administration of US President Joe Biden. Last week, a source familiar with the Russian thinking said Moscow would like to see OPEC+ cutting 1 million bpd or one percent of global supply. That would be the biggest cut since 2020 when OPEC+ reduced output by a record 10 million bpd as demand crashed due to the COVID pandemic. The group spent the next two years unwinding those record cuts. On Sunday, the sources said the cut could exceed 1 million bpd. One of the sources suggested cuts could also include a voluntary additional reduction of production by Saudi Arabia. OPEC+ will meet in person in Vienna for the first time since March 2020. Analysts and OPEC watchers such as UBS and JP Morgan have suggested in recent days a cut of around 1 million bpd was on the cards and could help arrest the price decline. “$90 oil is non-negotiable for the OPEC+ leadership, hence they will act to safeguard this price floor,” said Stephen Brennock of oil broker PVM.</Text></Article><Article paper="cnn" author="[{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;Person&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Matt McFarland&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.cnn.com/profiles/matt-mcfarland&quot;}]"><Text>Tesla revealed on Friday a prototype of a humanoid robot that it says could be a future product for the automaker.  The robot, dubbed Optimus by Tesla, walked stiffly on stage at Tesla’s AI Day, slowly waved at the crowed and gestured with its hands for roughly one minute. Tesla CEO Elon Musk said that the robot was operating without a tether for the first time. Robotics developers often use tethers to support robots because they aren’t capable enough to walk without falling and damaging themselves.  The Optimus’ abilities appear to significantly trail what robots from competitors like Hyundai-owned Boston Dynamics are capable of. Boston Dynamics robots have been seen doing back flips and performing sophisticated dance routines without a tether.  “The robot can actually do a lot more than we just showed you,” Musk said at the event. “We just didn’t want it to fall on its face.”  Tesla also showed videos of its robot performing simple tasks like carrying boxes and watering plants with a watering can.  Musk claimed that if the robot was produced in mass volumes it would “probably” cost less than $20,000. Tesla maintains that Optimus’ advantage over competitors will be its ability to navigate independently using technology developed from Tesla’s driver-assistance system “Full Self Driving,” as well as cost savings from what it has learned about manufacturing from its automotive division. (Tesla’s “Full Self Driving” requires a human that is alert and attentive, ready to take over at any time, as it is not yet capable of fully driving itself.) Tesla has a history of aggressive price targets that it doesn’t ultimately reach. The Tesla Model 3 was long promised as a $35,000 vehicle, but could only very briefly be purchased for that price, and not directly on its website. The most affordable Tesla Model 3 now costs $46,990. When Tesla revealed the Cybertruck in 2019, its pick-up truck that remains unavailable for purchase today, it was said to cost $39,990, but the price has since been removed from Tesla’s website. Tesla AI Day is intended largely as a recruiting event to attract talented people to join the company.  Musk claimed the robot could be transformative for civilization. The robot displayed Friday, despite its limitations compared to competitors, was significantly ahead of what Tesla revealed a year ago, when a person jumped on stage in a robot suit and danced around.  “‘Last year was just a person in a robot suit,” Musk said before the robot walked on stage. “We’ve come a long way. Compared to that, it’s going to be very impressive.”  Tesla is not the first automaker to develop a humanoid robot. Along with Hyundai’s Boston Dynamics, Honda worked on robots dubbed “Asimo” for nearly 20 years. In its final form, Asimo was a child-size humanoid robot capable of untethered walking, running, climbing and descending stairs, and manipulating objects with its fingers.</Text></Article><Article paper="cnn" author="[{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;Person&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Story by Reuters&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;&quot;}]"><Text> Lindt &amp; Spruengli’s foil-wrapped chocolate bunnies deserve protection from copycat products, Switzerland’s highest court ruled on Thursday, and ordered German discounter Lidl to stop selling a similar product in Switzerland and to destroy its remaining stock. Surveys submitted by Lindt showed Lindt’s Easter bunny was well known to the public, the Federal Court said, adding the two products were likely to be confused even though there were some differences between them. It overturned a Swiss commercial court’s ruling against Lindt and in favor of two Swiss units of Lidl last year and ordered Lidl to destroy its inventory of chocolate bunnies. “Destruction is proportionate, especially as it does not necessarily mean that the chocolate as such would have to be destroyed,” it said in a summary of its verdict.

In addition to water loss due to an intense multiyear drought, the US Geological Survey and the Bureau of Reclamation report found, Lake Powell faced an average annual loss in storage capacity of about 33,270 acre-feet, or 11 billion gallons, per year between 1963 and 2018. That’s enough water to fill the Reflecting Pool on the National Mall about 1,600 times. The capacity of the reservoir is shrinking because of sediments flowing in from the Colorado and San Juan rivers, according to the report. Those sediments settle at the bottom of the reservoir and decrease the total amount of water the reservoir can hold.  As of Monday, Lake Powell was around 25% full, according to data from the Bureau of Reclamation. It’s bad news for a region already facing water shortages and extreme wildfires due to the drought. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration drought experts said last week these conditions are expected to at least continue – if not worsen – in the coming months. Lake Powell is an important reservoir in the Colorado River Basin. Both Lake Powell and nearby Lake Mead, the nation’s largest reservoir, have drained at an alarming rate. In August, the federal government declared a water shortage on the Colorado River for the first time after Lake Mead’s water level plunged to unprecedented lows, triggering mandatory water consumption cuts for states in the Southwest that began in January. And last week, Lake Powell dipped below the critical threshold of 3,525 feet above sea level, sparking additional concerns about water supply and hydropower generation millions of people in the West rely on for electricity. The significance of the dwindling water supply along the Colorado cannot be overstated. The system supplies water for more than 40 million people living across seven Western states and Mexico. Lakes Powell and Mead provide a critical supply of drinking water and irrigation for many across the region, including rural farms, ranches and native communities. “It is vitally important we have the best-available scientific information like this report to provide a clear understanding of water availability in Lake Powell as we plan for the future,” Tanya Trujillo, assistant secretary for water and science with the US Department of Interior, said in a statement. “The Colorado River system faces multiple challenges, including the effects of a 22-year-long drought and the increased impacts of climate change.”</Text></Article><Article paper="cnn" author="[{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;Person&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Rachel Ramirez&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.cnn.com/profiles/rachel-ramirez&quot;}]"><Text>Air pollution spiked to unhealthy levels around the world in 2021, according to a new report. The report by IQAir, a company that tracks global air quality, found that average annual air pollution in every country — and 97% of cities — exceeded the World Health Organization’s air quality guidelines, which were designed to help governments craft regulations to protect public health.  Only 222 cities of the 6,475 analyzed had average air quality that met WHO’s standard. Three territories were found to have met WHO guidelines: the French territory of New Caledonia and the United States territories of Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. India, Pakistan and Bangladesh were among the countries with the worst air pollution, exceeding the guidelines by at least 10 times.  The Scandinavian countries, Australia, Canada, Japan and United Kingdom ranked among the best countries for air quality, with average levels that exceeded the guidelines by 1 to 2 times. In the United States, IQAir found air pollution exceeded WHO guidelines by 2 to 3 times in 2021. “This report underscores the need for governments around the world to help reduce global air pollution,” Glory Dolphin Hammes, CEO of IQAir North America, told CNN. “(Fine particulate matter) kills far too many people every year and governments need to set more stringent air quality national standards and explore better foreign policies that promote better air quality.” Above: IQAir analyzed average annual air quality for more than 6,000 cities and categorized them from best air quality, in blue (Meets WHO PM2.5 guildline) to worst, in purple (Exceeds WHO PM2.5 guideline by over 10 times). An interactive map is available from IQAir. It’s the first major global air quality report based on WHO’s new annual air pollution guidelines, which were updated in September 2021. The new guidelines halved the acceptable concentration of fine particulate matter — or PM 2.5 — from 10 down to 5 micrograms per cubic meter. PM 2.5 is the tiniest pollutant yet also among the most dangerous. When inhaled, it travels deep into lung tissue where it can enter the bloodstream. It comes from sources like the burning of fossil fuels, dust storms and wildfires, and has been linked to a number of health threats including asthma, heart disease and other respiratory illnesses.  Millions of people die each year from air quality issues. In 2016, around 4.2 million premature deaths were associated with fine particulate matter, according to WHO. If the 2021 guidelines had been applied that year, WHO found there could have been nearly 3.3 million fewer pollution-related deaths. IQAir analyzed pollution-monitoring stations in 6,475 cities across 117 countries, regions and territories. In the US, air pollution spiked in 2021 compared to 2020. Out of the more than 2,400 US cities analyzed, Los Angeles air remained the most polluted, despite seeing a 6% decrease compared to 2020. Atlanta and Minneapolis saw significant increases in pollution, the report showed. “The (United States’) reliance on fossil fuels, increasing severity of wildfires as well as varying enforcement of the Clean Air Act from administration to administration have all added to U.S. air pollution,” the authors wrote. Researchers say the main sources of pollution in the US were fossil fuel-powered transportation, energy production and wildfires, which wreak havoc on the country’s most vulnerable and marginalized communities.  “We are heavily dependent on fossil fuels, especially in terms of transportation,” said Hammes, who lives a few miles from Los Angeles. “We can act smartly on this with zero emissions, but we’re still not doing it. And this is having a devastating impact on the air pollution that we’re seeing in major cities.”  Climate change-fueled wildfires played a significant role in reducing air quality in the US in 2021. The authors pointed to a number of fires that led to hazardous air pollution — including the Caldor and Dixie fires in California, as well as the Bootleg Fire in Oregon, which wafted smoke all the way to the East Coast in July.    China — which is among the countries with the worst air pollution — showed improved air quality in 2021. More than half of the Chinese cities analyzed in the report saw lower levels of air pollution compared to the previous year. The capital city of Beijing continued a five-year trend of improved air quality, according to the report, due to a policy-driven drawdown of polluting industries in the city. The report also found that the Amazon Rainforest, which had acted as the world’s major defender against the climate crisis, emitted more carbon dioxide than it absorbed last year. Deforestation and wildfires have threatened the critical ecosystem, polluted the air and contributed to climate change.  “This is all a part of the formula that will lead to or is leading to global warming.” Hammes said.  The report also unveiled some inequalities: Monitoring stations remain scant in some developing countries in Africa, South America and the Middle East, resulting in a dearth of air quality data in those regions.  “When you don’t have that data, you’re really in the dark,” Hammes said.  Hammes noted the African country of Chad was included in the report for the first time, due to an improvement in its monitoring network. IQAir found the country’s air pollution was the second-highest in the world last year, behind Bangladesh.  Tarik Benmarhnia, a climate change epidemiologist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography who has studied the health impact of wildfire smoke, also noted that relying only on monitoring stations can lead to blind spots in these reports. “I think it is great that they relied on different networks and not only governmental sources,” Benmarhnia, who was not involved in this report, told CNN. “However, many regions do not have enough stations and alternative techniques exist.” The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded in its 2021 report that, in addition to slowing the speed of global warming, curbing the use of fossil fuels would have the added benefit of improving air quality and public health.  Hammes said the IQAir report is even more reason for the world to wean off fossil fuel. “We’ve got the report, we can read it, we can internalize it and really devote ourselves to taking action,” she said. “There needs to be a major move towards renewable energy. We need to take drastic action in order to reverse the tide of global warming; otherwise, the impact and the train that we’re on (would be) irreversible.”</Text></Article><Article paper="cnn" author="[{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;Person&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Rachel Ramirez&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.cnn.com/profiles/rachel-ramirez&quot;},{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;Person&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Nathaniel Meyersohn&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.cnn.com/profiles/nathaniel-meyersohn&quot;}]"><Text>As the US attempts to wean itself off its heavy reliance on fossil fuels and shift to cleaner energy sources, many experts are eyeing a promising solution: your neighborhood big-box stores and shopping malls. The rooftops and parking lot space available at retail giants like Walmart, Target and Costco is massive. And these largely empty spaces are being touted as untapped potential for solar power that could help the US reduce its dependency on foreign energy, slash planet-warming emissions and save companies millions of dollars in the process. At the IKEA store in Baltimore, installing solar panels on the roof and over the store’s parking lot cut the amount of energy it needed to purchase by 84%, slashing its costs by 57% from September to December of 2020, according to the company. (The panels also provide some beneficial shade to keep customers’ cars cool on hot, sunny days.)   As of February 2021, IKEA had 54 solar arrays installed across 90% of its US locations. Big-box stores and shopping centers have enough roof space to produce half of their annual electricity needs from solar, according to a report from nonprofit Environment America and research firm Frontier Group.  Leveraging the full rooftop solar potential of these superstores would generate enough electricity to power nearly 8 million average homes, the report concluded, and would cut the same amount of planet-warming emissions as pulling 11.3 million gas-powered cars off the road. The average Walmart store, for example, has 180,000 square feet of rooftop, according to the report. That’s roughly the size of three football fields and enough space to support solar energy that could power the equivalent of 200 homes, the report said. “Every rooftop in America that isn’t producing solar energy is a rooftop wasted as we work to break our dependence on fossil fuels and the geopolitical conflicts that come with them,” Johanna Neumann, senior director for Environment America’s campaign for 100% Renewable, told CNN. “Now is the time to lean into local renewable energy production, and there’s no better place than the roofs of America’s big-box superstores.”  Advocates involved in clean energy worker-training programs tell CNN that a solar revolution in big-box retail would also be a significant windfall for local communities, spurring economic growth while tackling the climate crisis, which has inflicted disproportionate harm on marginalized communities. Yet only a fraction of big-box stores in the US have solar on their rooftops or solar canopies in parking lots, the report’s authors told CNN.    CNN reached out to five of the top US retailers — Walmart, Kroger, Home Depot, Costco and Target — to ask: Why not invest in more rooftop solar? Many renewable energy experts point to solar as a relatively simple solution to cut down on costs and help rein in fossil fuel emissions, but the companies point to several roadblocks — regulations, labor costs and structural integrity of the rooftops themselves — that are preventing more widespread adoption. The need for these kinds of clean energy initiatives is becoming “unquestionably urgent” as the climate crisis accelerates, said Edwin Cowen, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Cornell University. “We are behind the eight ball, to put it mildly,” Cowen told CNN. “I would have loved to see policy help incentivize rooftop solar 15 years ago instead of five years ago in the commercial space. There’s still a tremendous amount of work to do.” What’s the holdup? Neumann said Walmart, the nation’s largest retailer, possesses by far the largest solar potential. Walmart has around 5,000 stores in the US and more than 783 million square feet of rooftop space — an area larger than Manhattan — and more than 8,974 gigawatt hours of annual rooftop solar potential, according to the report.  It’s enough electricity to power more than 842,000 homes, the report said.   Walmart spokesperson Mariel Messier told CNN the company is involved in renewable energy projects around the world, but many of them are not rooftop solar installations. The company has reported having completed on- and off-site wind and solar projects or had others under development with a capacity to produce more than 2.3 gigawatts of renewable energy. Neumann said Environment America has met with Walmart a few times, urging the retailer to commit to installing solar panels on roofs and in parking lots. The company has said it’s aiming to source 100% of its energy through renewable projects by 2035. “Of all the retailers in America, Walmart stands to make the biggest impact if they put rooftop solar on all of their stores,” Neumann told CNN. “And for us, this report just underscores just how much of an impact they could make if they make that decision.” According to Environment America, Walmart had installed almost 194 megawatts of solar capacity on its US facilities as of the end of the 2021 fiscal year and additional capacity in off-site solar farms. The company’s installations in California were expected to provide between 20% to 30% of each location’s electricity needs.  Target ranked No. 1 for on-site solar capacity in 2019, according to industry trade group Solar Energy Industries Association’s most recent report. It currently has 542 locations with rooftop solar — around a quarter of the company’s stores — a Target spokesperson told CNN. Rooftop solar generates enough energy to meet 15% to 40% of Target properties’ energy needs, the spokesperson said. Richard Galanti, the chief financial officer at Costco, said the company has 121 stores with rooftop solar around the world, 95 of which are in the US.  Walmart, Target and Costco did not share with CNN what their biggest barriers are to adding rooftop or parking lot solar panels to more stores.  “My suspicion is that they want an even stronger business case for deviating from business-as-usual,” Neumann said. “Historically, all those roofs have done is cover their stores, and rethinking how [they] use their buildings and thinking of them as energy generators, not just protection from rain, requires a small change in their business model.” Home Depot, which has around 2,300 stores, currently has 75 completed rooftop solar projects, 12 in construction and more than 30 planned for future development, said Craig D’Arcy, the company’s director of energy management. Solar power generates around half of these stores’ energy needs on average, he said.  Aging rooftops at stores are a “huge impediment” to solar installation, D’Arcy added. If a roof needs to be replaced in the next 15 to 20 years or sooner, it doesn’t make financial sense for Home Depot to add solar systems today, he said. “We have a goal of implementing solar rooftop where the economics are attractive,” D’Arcy told CNN.  CNN also reached out to Kroger, which owns about 2,800 stores across the US. Kristal Howard, a Kroger spokesperson, said the company currently has 15 properties — stores, distribution centers and manufacturing plants — with solar installations. One of the “multiple factors affecting the viability of a solar installation” was the stores’ ability to support a solar installation on the roofs, Howard said.  Cowen, the engineering professor at Cornell, said solar is already attractive, but that labor costs, incentives and the different layers of regulation likely pose some financial challenges in solar installations.  “For them, this means usually hiring a local site firm that can do that installation that also knows local policy,” Cowen said. “It’s just another layer of complexity that I think is beginning to make sense because the costs have come down enough, but it needs kind of reopening that door of getting into an existing building.”  Rep. Sean Casten of Illinois, who co-chairs the power sector task force in the House, said the US has “failed to provide the incentives to people who have the expertise to go in and build these things.” The reason both retail companies and the power sector have not made much progress on solar is because “our system is so disjointed” and has a complex regulation structure, Casten said. “Why aren’t we doing something that makes economic sense? The answer is this horribly disjointed federal policy where we massively subsidize fossil energy extraction, and we penalize clean energy production,” Casten told CNN. “For a long, long time, if you wanted to build a solar panel on the rooftop of Walmart, your biggest enemy was going to be your local utility because they didn’t want to lose the load. “We could have done this decades ago,” Casten added. “And had we done it, we would not be in this dire position with the climate, but we’d also have a lot more money in our pocket.” Acting on climate, equitably For Charles Callaway, director of organizing at the nonprofit group WE ACT for Environmental Justice, strengthening the rooftop solar capacity in big box retail stores is a no-brainer, especially if companies allow the local community to reap benefits either through installation jobs or sharing the electricity produced later. Either way, it would put a massive dent in curbing the climate crisis and help usher in an equitable transition away from fossil fuels — and it’s doable, Callaway told CNN.  The New York City resident led a worker training program that helped train more than 100 local community members, mostly people of color, to become solar installers. He also formed a solar workers cooperative to ensure many of the participants of the training program get jobs in a tough market.  In the last two years, Callaway said his group has not only installed solar panels on roofs of affordable housing units, but also equipment capable of producing 2 megawatts of solar energy on shopping malls up in upstate New York. He emphasized that hiring locally would be most beneficial since local installers know the community and local regulations best.   “One of my huge concerns is social equity,” Cowen said. “Access to renewable energy is a fairly privileged position these days, and we’ve got to figure out ways to make that not true.” Jasmine Graham, WE ACT’s energy justice policy manager, said the potential of building rooftop solar on big box superstores is encouraging, only “if these projects use local labor, if they are paying prevailing wages, and if this solar is being used in a manner such as community solar, which would allow [utility] bill discounts for folks that live in the same utility zone.” Pressure is mounting for global leaders to act urgently on the climate crisis after a UN report in late February warned the window for action is rapidly closing. Neumann believes the US can meet its energy demand with renewables. All it takes, she said, is the political will to make that switch, and the inclusion of the local community so no one gets left behind in the transition.  “The sooner we make that transition, the sooner we’ll have cleaner air, the sooner we’ll have a more protected environment and better health and the sooner we’ll have a more livable future for our kids,” Neumann said. “And even if that requires investment, it is an investment worth making.” CNN’s Judson Jones contributed to this report.</Text></Article><Article paper="cnn" author="[{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;Person&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Rachel Ramirez&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.cnn.com/profiles/rachel-ramirez&quot;},{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;Person&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Nathaniel Meyersohn&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.cnn.com/profiles/nathaniel-meyersohn&quot;}]"><Text>As the US attempts to wean itself off its heavy reliance on fossil fuels and shift to cleaner energy sources, many experts are eyeing a promising solution: your neighborhood big-box stores and shopping malls. The rooftops and parking lot space available at retail giants like Walmart, Target and Costco is massive. And these largely empty spaces are being touted as untapped potential for solar power that could help the US reduce its dependency on foreign energy, slash planet-warming emissions and save companies millions of dollars in the process. At the IKEA store in Baltimore, installing solar panels on the roof and over the store’s parking lot cut the amount of energy it needed to purchase by 84%, slashing its costs by 57% from September to December of 2020, according to the company. (The panels also provide some beneficial shade to keep customers’ cars cool on hot, sunny days.)   As of February 2021, IKEA had 54 solar arrays installed across 90% of its US locations. Big-box stores and shopping centers have enough roof space to produce half of their annual electricity needs from solar, according to a report from nonprofit Environment America and research firm Frontier Group.  Leveraging the full rooftop solar potential of these superstores would generate enough electricity to power nearly 8 million average homes, the report concluded, and would cut the same amount of planet-warming emissions as pulling 11.3 million gas-powered cars off the road. The average Walmart store, for example, has 180,000 square feet of rooftop, according to the report. That’s roughly the size of three football fields and enough space to support solar energy that could power the equivalent of 200 homes, the report said. “Every rooftop in America that isn’t producing solar energy is a rooftop wasted as we work to break our dependence on fossil fuels and the geopolitical conflicts that come with them,” Johanna Neumann, senior director for Environment America’s campaign for 100% Renewable, told CNN. “Now is the time to lean into local renewable energy production, and there’s no better place than the roofs of America’s big-box superstores.”  Advocates involved in clean energy worker-training programs tell CNN that a solar revolution in big-box retail would also be a significant windfall for local communities, spurring economic growth while tackling the climate crisis, which has inflicted disproportionate harm on marginalized communities. Yet only a fraction of big-box stores in the US have solar on their rooftops or solar canopies in parking lots, the report’s authors told CNN.    CNN reached out to five of the top US retailers — Walmart, Kroger, Home Depot, Costco and Target — to ask: Why not invest in more rooftop solar? Many renewable energy experts point to solar as a relatively simple solution to cut down on costs and help rein in fossil fuel emissions, but the companies point to several roadblocks — regulations, labor costs and structural integrity of the rooftops themselves — that are preventing more widespread adoption. The need for these kinds of clean energy initiatives is becoming “unquestionably urgent” as the climate crisis accelerates, said Edwin Cowen, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Cornell University. “We are behind the eight ball, to put it mildly,” Cowen told CNN. “I would have loved to see policy help incentivize rooftop solar 15 years ago instead of five years ago in the commercial space. There’s still a tremendous amount of work to do.” What’s the holdup? Neumann said Walmart, the nation’s largest retailer, possesses by far the largest solar potential. Walmart has around 5,000 stores in the US and more than 783 million square feet of rooftop space — an area larger than Manhattan — and more than 8,974 gigawatt hours of annual rooftop solar potential, according to the report.  It’s enough electricity to power more than 842,000 homes, the report said.   Walmart spokesperson Mariel Messier told CNN the company is involved in renewable energy projects around the world, but many of them are not rooftop solar installations. The company has reported having completed on- and off-site wind and solar projects or had others under development with a capacity to produce more than 2.3 gigawatts of renewable energy. Neumann said Environment America has met with Walmart a few times, urging the retailer to commit to installing solar panels on roofs and in parking lots. The company has said it’s aiming to source 100% of its energy through renewable projects by 2035. “Of all the retailers in America, Walmart stands to make the biggest impact if they put rooftop solar on all of their stores,” Neumann told CNN. “And for us, this report just underscores just how much of an impact they could make if they make that decision.” According to Environment America, Walmart had installed almost 194 megawatts of solar capacity on its US facilities as of the end of the 2021 fiscal year and additional capacity in off-site solar farms. The company’s installations in California were expected to provide between 20% to 30% of each location’s electricity needs.  Target ranked No. 1 for on-site solar capacity in 2019, according to industry trade group Solar Energy Industries Association’s most recent report. It currently has 542 locations with rooftop solar — around a quarter of the company’s stores — a Target spokesperson told CNN. Rooftop solar generates enough energy to meet 15% to 40% of Target properties’ energy needs, the spokesperson said. Richard Galanti, the chief financial officer at Costco, said the company has 121 stores with rooftop solar around the world, 95 of which are in the US.  Walmart, Target and Costco did not share with CNN what their biggest barriers are to adding rooftop or parking lot solar panels to more stores.  “My suspicion is that they want an even stronger business case for deviating from business-as-usual,” Neumann said. “Historically, all those roofs have done is cover their stores, and rethinking how [they] use their buildings and thinking of them as energy generators, not just protection from rain, requires a small change in their business model.” Home Depot, which has around 2,300 stores, currently has 75 completed rooftop solar projects, 12 in construction and more than 30 planned for future development, said Craig D’Arcy, the company’s director of energy management. Solar power generates around half of these stores’ energy needs on average, he said.  Aging rooftops at stores are a “huge impediment” to solar installation, D’Arcy added. If a roof needs to be replaced in the next 15 to 20 years or sooner, it doesn’t make financial sense for Home Depot to add solar systems today, he said. “We have a goal of implementing solar rooftop where the economics are attractive,” D’Arcy told CNN.  CNN also reached out to Kroger, which owns about 2,800 stores across the US. Kristal Howard, a Kroger spokesperson, said the company currently has 15 properties — stores, distribution centers and manufacturing plants — with solar installations. One of the “multiple factors affecting the viability of a solar installation” was the stores’ ability to support a solar installation on the roofs, Howard said.  Cowen, the engineering professor at Cornell, said solar is already attractive, but that labor costs, incentives and the different layers of regulation likely pose some financial challenges in solar installations.  “For them, this means usually hiring a local site firm that can do that installation that also knows local policy,” Cowen said. “It’s just another layer of complexity that I think is beginning to make sense because the costs have come down enough, but it needs kind of reopening that door of getting into an existing building.”  Rep. Sean Casten of Illinois, who co-chairs the power sector task force in the House, said the US has “failed to provide the incentives to people who have the expertise to go in and build these things.” The reason both retail companies and the power sector have not made much progress on solar is because “our system is so disjointed” and has a complex regulation structure, Casten said. “Why aren’t we doing something that makes economic sense? The answer is this horribly disjointed federal policy where we massively subsidize fossil energy extraction, and we penalize clean energy production,” Casten told CNN. “For a long, long time, if you wanted to build a solar panel on the rooftop of Walmart, your biggest enemy was going to be your local utility because they didn’t want to lose the load. “We could have done this decades ago,” Casten added. “And had we done it, we would not be in this dire position with the climate, but we’d also have a lot more money in our pocket.” Acting on climate, equitably For Charles Callaway, director of organizing at the nonprofit group WE ACT for Environmental Justice, strengthening the rooftop solar capacity in big box retail stores is a no-brainer, especially if companies allow the local community to reap benefits either through installation jobs or sharing the electricity produced later. Either way, it would put a massive dent in curbing the climate crisis and help usher in an equitable transition away from fossil fuels — and it’s doable, Callaway told CNN.  The New York City resident led a worker training program that helped train more than 100 local community members, mostly people of color, to become solar installers. He also formed a solar workers cooperative to ensure many of the participants of the training program get jobs in a tough market.  In the last two years, Callaway said his group has not only installed solar panels on roofs of affordable housing units, but also equipment capable of producing 2 megawatts of solar energy on shopping malls up in upstate New York.

All it takes, she said, is the political will to make that switch, and the inclusion of the local community so no one gets left behind in the transition.  “The sooner we make that transition, the sooner we’ll have cleaner air, the sooner we’ll have a more protected environment and better health and the sooner we’ll have a more livable future for our kids,” Neumann said. “And even if that requires investment, it is an investment worth making.” CNN’s Judson Jones contributed to this report.</Text></Article><Article paper="cnn" author="[{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;Person&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Rachel Ramirez&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.cnn.com/profiles/rachel-ramirez&quot;},{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;Person&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Nathaniel Meyersohn&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.cnn.com/profiles/nathaniel-meyersohn&quot;}]"><Text>As the US attempts to wean itself off its heavy reliance on fossil fuels and shift to cleaner energy sources, many experts are eyeing a promising solution: your neighborhood big-box stores and shopping malls. The rooftops and parking lot space available at retail giants like Walmart, Target and Costco is massive. And these largely empty spaces are being touted as untapped potential for solar power that could help the US reduce its dependency on foreign energy, slash planet-warming emissions and save companies millions of dollars in the process. At the IKEA store in Baltimore, installing solar panels on the roof and over the store’s parking lot cut the amount of energy it needed to purchase by 84%, slashing its costs by 57% from September to December of 2020, according to the company. (The panels also provide some beneficial shade to keep customers’ cars cool on hot, sunny days.)   As of February 2021, IKEA had 54 solar arrays installed across 90% of its US locations. Big-box stores and shopping centers have enough roof space to produce half of their annual electricity needs from solar, according to a report from nonprofit Environment America and research firm Frontier Group.  Leveraging the full rooftop solar potential of these superstores would generate enough electricity to power nearly 8 million average homes, the report concluded, and would cut the same amount of planet-warming emissions as pulling 11.3 million gas-powered cars off the road. The average Walmart store, for example, has 180,000 square feet of rooftop, according to the report. That’s roughly the size of three football fields and enough space to support solar energy that could power the equivalent of 200 homes, the report said. “Every rooftop in America that isn’t producing solar energy is a rooftop wasted as we work to break our dependence on fossil fuels and the geopolitical conflicts that come with them,” Johanna Neumann, senior director for Environment America’s campaign for 100% Renewable, told CNN. “Now is the time to lean into local renewable energy production, and there’s no better place than the roofs of America’s big-box superstores.”  Advocates involved in clean energy worker-training programs tell CNN that a solar revolution in big-box retail would also be a significant windfall for local communities, spurring economic growth while tackling the climate crisis, which has inflicted disproportionate harm on marginalized communities. Yet only a fraction of big-box stores in the US have solar on their rooftops or solar canopies in parking lots, the report’s authors told CNN.    CNN reached out to five of the top US retailers — Walmart, Kroger, Home Depot, Costco and Target — to ask: Why not invest in more rooftop solar? Many renewable energy experts point to solar as a relatively simple solution to cut down on costs and help rein in fossil fuel emissions, but the companies point to several roadblocks — regulations, labor costs and structural integrity of the rooftops themselves — that are preventing more widespread adoption. The need for these kinds of clean energy initiatives is becoming “unquestionably urgent” as the climate crisis accelerates, said Edwin Cowen, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Cornell University. “We are behind the eight ball, to put it mildly,” Cowen told CNN. “I would have loved to see policy help incentivize rooftop solar 15 years ago instead of five years ago in the commercial space. There’s still a tremendous amount of work to do.” What’s the holdup? Neumann said Walmart, the nation’s largest retailer, possesses by far the largest solar potential. Walmart has around 5,000 stores in the US and more than 783 million square feet of rooftop space — an area larger than Manhattan — and more than 8,974 gigawatt hours of annual rooftop solar potential, according to the report.  It’s enough electricity to power more than 842,000 homes, the report said.   Walmart spokesperson Mariel Messier told CNN the company is involved in renewable energy projects around the world, but many of them are not rooftop solar installations. The company has reported having completed on- and off-site wind and solar projects or had others under development with a capacity to produce more than 2.3 gigawatts of renewable energy. Neumann said Environment America has met with Walmart a few times, urging the retailer to commit to installing solar panels on roofs and in parking lots. The company has said it’s aiming to source 100% of its energy through renewable projects by 2035. “Of all the retailers in America, Walmart stands to make the biggest impact if they put rooftop solar on all of their stores,” Neumann told CNN. “And for us, this report just underscores just how much of an impact they could make if they make that decision.” According to Environment America, Walmart had installed almost 194 megawatts of solar capacity on its US facilities as of the end of the 2021 fiscal year and additional capacity in off-site solar farms. The company’s installations in California were expected to provide between 20% to 30% of each location’s electricity needs.  Target ranked No. 1 for on-site solar capacity in 2019, according to industry trade group Solar Energy Industries Association’s most recent report. It currently has 542 locations with rooftop solar — around a quarter of the company’s stores — a Target spokesperson told CNN. Rooftop solar generates enough energy to meet 15% to 40% of Target properties’ energy needs, the spokesperson said. Richard Galanti, the chief financial officer at Costco, said the company has 121 stores with rooftop solar around the world, 95 of which are in the US.  Walmart, Target and Costco did not share with CNN what their biggest barriers are to adding rooftop or parking lot solar panels to more stores.  “My suspicion is that they want an even stronger business case for deviating from business-as-usual,” Neumann said. “Historically, all those roofs have done is cover their stores, and rethinking how [they] use their buildings and thinking of them as energy generators, not just protection from rain, requires a small change in their business model.” Home Depot, which has around 2,300 stores, currently has 75 completed rooftop solar projects, 12 in construction and more than 30 planned for future development, said Craig D’Arcy, the company’s director of energy management. Solar power generates around half of these stores’ energy needs on average, he said.  Aging rooftops at stores are a “huge impediment” to solar installation, D’Arcy added. If a roof needs to be replaced in the next 15 to 20 years or sooner, it doesn’t make financial sense for Home Depot to add solar systems today, he said. “We have a goal of implementing solar rooftop where the economics are attractive,” D’Arcy told CNN.  CNN also reached out to Kroger, which owns about 2,800 stores across the US. Kristal Howard, a Kroger spokesperson, said the company currently has 15 properties — stores, distribution centers and manufacturing plants — with solar installations. One of the “multiple factors affecting the viability of a solar installation” was the stores’ ability to support a solar installation on the roofs, Howard said.  Cowen, the engineering professor at Cornell, said solar is already attractive, but that labor costs, incentives and the different layers of regulation likely pose some financial challenges in solar installations.  “For them, this means usually hiring a local site firm that can do that installation that also knows local policy,” Cowen said. “It’s just another layer of complexity that I think is beginning to make sense because the costs have come down enough, but it needs kind of reopening that door of getting into an existing building.”  Rep. Sean Casten of Illinois, who co-chairs the power sector task force in the House, said the US has “failed to provide the incentives to people who have the expertise to go in and build these things.” The reason both retail companies and the power sector have not made much progress on solar is because “our system is so disjointed” and has a complex regulation structure, Casten said. “Why aren’t we doing something that makes economic sense? The answer is this horribly disjointed federal policy where we massively subsidize fossil energy extraction, and we penalize clean energy production,” Casten told CNN. “For a long, long time, if you wanted to build a solar panel on the rooftop of Walmart, your biggest enemy was going to be your local utility because they didn’t want to lose the load. “We could have done this decades ago,” Casten added. “And had we done it, we would not be in this dire position with the climate, but we’d also have a lot more money in our pocket.” Acting on climate, equitably For Charles Callaway, director of organizing at the nonprofit group WE ACT for Environmental Justice, strengthening the rooftop solar capacity in big box retail stores is a no-brainer, especially if companies allow the local community to reap benefits either through installation jobs or sharing the electricity produced later. Either way, it would put a massive dent in curbing the climate crisis and help usher in an equitable transition away from fossil fuels — and it’s doable, Callaway told CNN.  The New York City resident led a worker training program that helped train more than 100 local community members, mostly people of color, to become solar installers. He also formed a solar workers cooperative to ensure many of the participants of the training program get jobs in a tough market.  In the last two years, Callaway said his group has not only installed solar panels on roofs of affordable housing units, but also equipment capable of producing 2 megawatts of solar energy on shopping malls up in upstate New York. He emphasized that hiring locally would be most beneficial since local installers know the community and local regulations best.   “One of my huge concerns is social equity,” Cowen said. “Access to renewable energy is a fairly privileged position these days, and we’ve got to figure out ways to make that not true.” Jasmine Graham, WE ACT’s energy justice policy manager, said the potential of building rooftop solar on big box superstores is encouraging, only “if these projects use local labor, if they are paying prevailing wages, and if this solar is being used in a manner such as community solar, which would allow [utility] bill discounts for folks that live in the same utility zone.” Pressure is mounting for global leaders to act urgently on the climate crisis after a UN report in late February warned the window for action is rapidly closing.

All it takes, she said, is the political will to make that switch, and the inclusion of the local community so no one gets left behind in the transition.  “The sooner we make that transition, the sooner we’ll have cleaner air, the sooner we’ll have a more protected environment and better health and the sooner we’ll have a more livable future for our kids,” Neumann said. “And even if that requires investment, it is an investment worth making.” CNN’s Judson Jones contributed to this report.</Text></Article><Article paper="cnn" author="[{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;Person&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Rachel Ramirez&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.cnn.com/profiles/rachel-ramirez&quot;},{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;Person&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Nathaniel Meyersohn&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.cnn.com/profiles/nathaniel-meyersohn&quot;}]"><Text>As the US attempts to wean itself off its heavy reliance on fossil fuels and shift to cleaner energy sources, many experts are eyeing a promising solution: your neighborhood big-box stores and shopping malls. The rooftops and parking lot space available at retail giants like Walmart, Target and Costco is massive. And these largely empty spaces are being touted as untapped potential for solar power that could help the US reduce its dependency on foreign energy, slash planet-warming emissions and save companies millions of dollars in the process. At the IKEA store in Baltimore, installing solar panels on the roof and over the store’s parking lot cut the amount of energy it needed to purchase by 84%, slashing its costs by 57% from September to December of 2020, according to the company. (The panels also provide some beneficial shade to keep customers’ cars cool on hot, sunny days.)   As of February 2021, IKEA had 54 solar arrays installed across 90% of its US locations. Big-box stores and shopping centers have enough roof space to produce half of their annual electricity needs from solar, according to a report from nonprofit Environment America and research firm Frontier Group.  Leveraging the full rooftop solar potential of these superstores would generate enough electricity to power nearly 8 million average homes, the report concluded, and would cut the same amount of planet-warming emissions as pulling 11.3 million gas-powered cars off the road. The average Walmart store, for example, has 180,000 square feet of rooftop, according to the report. That’s roughly the size of three football fields and enough space to support solar energy that could power the equivalent of 200 homes, the report said. “Every rooftop in America that isn’t producing solar energy is a rooftop wasted as we work to break our dependence on fossil fuels and the geopolitical conflicts that come with them,” Johanna Neumann, senior director for Environment America’s campaign for 100% Renewable, told CNN. “Now is the time to lean into local renewable energy production, and there’s no better place than the roofs of America’s big-box superstores.”  Advocates involved in clean energy worker-training programs tell CNN that a solar revolution in big-box retail would also be a significant windfall for local communities, spurring economic growth while tackling the climate crisis, which has inflicted disproportionate harm on marginalized communities. Yet only a fraction of big-box stores in the US have solar on their rooftops or solar canopies in parking lots, the report’s authors told CNN.    CNN reached out to five of the top US retailers — Walmart, Kroger, Home Depot, Costco and Target — to ask: Why not invest in more rooftop solar? Many renewable energy experts point to solar as a relatively simple solution to cut down on costs and help rein in fossil fuel emissions, but the companies point to several roadblocks — regulations, labor costs and structural integrity of the rooftops themselves — that are preventing more widespread adoption. The need for these kinds of clean energy initiatives is becoming “unquestionably urgent” as the climate crisis accelerates, said Edwin Cowen, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Cornell University. “We are behind the eight ball, to put it mildly,” Cowen told CNN. “I would have loved to see policy help incentivize rooftop solar 15 years ago instead of five years ago in the commercial space. There’s still a tremendous amount of work to do.” What’s the holdup? Neumann said Walmart, the nation’s largest retailer, possesses by far the largest solar potential. Walmart has around 5,000 stores in the US and more than 783 million square feet of rooftop space — an area larger than Manhattan — and more than 8,974 gigawatt hours of annual rooftop solar potential, according to the report.  It’s enough electricity to power more than 842,000 homes, the report said.   Walmart spokesperson Mariel Messier told CNN the company is involved in renewable energy projects around the world, but many of them are not rooftop solar installations. The company has reported having completed on- and off-site wind and solar projects or had others under development with a capacity to produce more than 2.3 gigawatts of renewable energy. Neumann said Environment America has met with Walmart a few times, urging the retailer to commit to installing solar panels on roofs and in parking lots. The company has said it’s aiming to source 100% of its energy through renewable projects by 2035. “Of all the retailers in America, Walmart stands to make the biggest impact if they put rooftop solar on all of their stores,” Neumann told CNN. “And for us, this report just underscores just how much of an impact they could make if they make that decision.” According to Environment America, Walmart had installed almost 194 megawatts of solar capacity on its US facilities as of the end of the 2021 fiscal year and additional capacity in off-site solar farms. The company’s installations in California were expected to provide between 20% to 30% of each location’s electricity needs.  Target ranked No. 1 for on-site solar capacity in 2019, according to industry trade group Solar Energy Industries Association’s most recent report. It currently has 542 locations with rooftop solar — around a quarter of the company’s stores — a Target spokesperson told CNN. Rooftop solar generates enough energy to meet 15% to 40% of Target properties’ energy needs, the spokesperson said. Richard Galanti, the chief financial officer at Costco, said the company has 121 stores with rooftop solar around the world, 95 of which are in the US.  Walmart, Target and Costco did not share with CNN what their biggest barriers are to adding rooftop or parking lot solar panels to more stores.  “My suspicion is that they want an even stronger business case for deviating from business-as-usual,” Neumann said. “Historically, all those roofs have done is cover their stores, and rethinking how [they] use their buildings and thinking of them as energy generators, not just protection from rain, requires a small change in their business model.” Home Depot, which has around 2,300 stores, currently has 75 completed rooftop solar projects, 12 in construction and more than 30 planned for future development, said Craig D’Arcy, the company’s director of energy management. Solar power generates around half of these stores’ energy needs on average, he said.  Aging rooftops at stores are a “huge impediment” to solar installation, D’Arcy added. If a roof needs to be replaced in the next 15 to 20 years or sooner, it doesn’t make financial sense for Home Depot to add solar systems today, he said. “We have a goal of implementing solar rooftop where the economics are attractive,” D’Arcy told CNN.  CNN also reached out to Kroger, which owns about 2,800 stores across the US. Kristal Howard, a Kroger spokesperson, said the company currently has 15 properties — stores, distribution centers and manufacturing plants — with solar installations. One of the “multiple factors affecting the viability of a solar installation” was the stores’ ability to support a solar installation on the roofs, Howard said.  Cowen, the engineering professor at Cornell, said solar is already attractive, but that labor costs, incentives and the different layers of regulation likely pose some financial challenges in solar installations.  “For them, this means usually hiring a local site firm that can do that installation that also knows local policy,” Cowen said. “It’s just another layer of complexity that I think is beginning to make sense because the costs have come down enough, but it needs kind of reopening that door of getting into an existing building.”  Rep. Sean Casten of Illinois, who co-chairs the power sector task force in the House, said the US has “failed to provide the incentives to people who have the expertise to go in and build these things.” The reason both retail companies and the power sector have not made much progress on solar is because “our system is so disjointed” and has a complex regulation structure, Casten said. “Why aren’t we doing something that makes economic sense? The answer is this horribly disjointed federal policy where we massively subsidize fossil energy extraction, and we penalize clean energy production,” Casten told CNN. “For a long, long time, if you wanted to build a solar panel on the rooftop of Walmart, your biggest enemy was going to be your local utility because they didn’t want to lose the load. “We could have done this decades ago,” Casten added. “And had we done it, we would not be in this dire position with the climate, but we’d also have a lot more money in our pocket.” Acting on climate, equitably For Charles Callaway, director of organizing at the nonprofit group WE ACT for Environmental Justice, strengthening the rooftop solar capacity in big box retail stores is a no-brainer, especially if companies allow the local community to reap benefits either through installation jobs or sharing the electricity produced later. Either way, it would put a massive dent in curbing the climate crisis and help usher in an equitable transition away from fossil fuels — and it’s doable, Callaway told CNN.  The New York City resident led a worker training program that helped train more than 100 local community members, mostly people of color, to become solar installers. He also formed a solar workers cooperative to ensure many of the participants of the training program get jobs in a tough market.  In the last two years, Callaway said his group has not only installed solar panels on roofs of affordable housing units, but also equipment capable of producing 2 megawatts of solar energy on shopping malls up in upstate New York. He emphasized that hiring locally would be most beneficial since local installers know the community and local regulations best.   “One of my huge concerns is social equity,” Cowen said. “Access to renewable energy is a fairly privileged position these days, and we’ve got to figure out ways to make that not true.” Jasmine Graham, WE ACT’s energy justice policy manager, said the potential of building rooftop solar on big box superstores is encouraging, only “if these projects use local labor, if they are paying prevailing wages, and if this solar is being used in a manner such as community solar, which would allow [utility] bill discounts for folks that live in the same utility zone.” Pressure is mounting for global leaders to act urgently on the climate crisis after a UN report in late February warned the window for action is rapidly closing.

All it takes, she said, is the political will to make that switch, and the inclusion of the local community so no one gets left behind in the transition.  “The sooner we make that transition, the sooner we’ll have cleaner air, the sooner we’ll have a more protected environment and better health and the sooner we’ll have a more livable future for our kids,” Neumann said. “And even if that requires investment, it is an investment worth making.” CNN’s Judson Jones contributed to this report.</Text></Article><Article paper="cnn" author="[{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;Person&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Rachel Ramirez&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.cnn.com/profiles/rachel-ramirez&quot;},{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;Person&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Nathaniel Meyersohn&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.cnn.com/profiles/nathaniel-meyersohn&quot;}]"><Text>As the US attempts to wean itself off its heavy reliance on fossil fuels and shift to cleaner energy sources, many experts are eyeing a promising solution: your neighborhood big-box stores and shopping malls. The rooftops and parking lot space available at retail giants like Walmart, Target and Costco is massive. And these largely empty spaces are being touted as untapped potential for solar power that could help the US reduce its dependency on foreign energy, slash planet-warming emissions and save companies millions of dollars in the process. At the IKEA store in Baltimore, installing solar panels on the roof and over the store’s parking lot cut the amount of energy it needed to purchase by 84%, slashing its costs by 57% from September to December of 2020, according to the company. (The panels also provide some beneficial shade to keep customers’ cars cool on hot, sunny days.)   As of February 2021, IKEA had 54 solar arrays installed across 90% of its US locations. Big-box stores and shopping centers have enough roof space to produce half of their annual electricity needs from solar, according to a report from nonprofit Environment America and research firm Frontier Group.  Leveraging the full rooftop solar potential of these superstores would generate enough electricity to power nearly 8 million average homes, the report concluded, and would cut the same amount of planet-warming emissions as pulling 11.3 million gas-powered cars off the road. The average Walmart store, for example, has 180,000 square feet of rooftop, according to the report. That’s roughly the size of three football fields and enough space to support solar energy that could power the equivalent of 200 homes, the report said. “Every rooftop in America that isn’t producing solar energy is a rooftop wasted as we work to break our dependence on fossil fuels and the geopolitical conflicts that come with them,” Johanna Neumann, senior director for Environment America’s campaign for 100% Renewable, told CNN. “Now is the time to lean into local renewable energy production, and there’s no better place than the roofs of America’s big-box superstores.”  Advocates involved in clean energy worker-training programs tell CNN that a solar revolution in big-box retail would also be a significant windfall for local communities, spurring economic growth while tackling the climate crisis, which has inflicted disproportionate harm on marginalized communities. Yet only a fraction of big-box stores in the US have solar on their rooftops or solar canopies in parking lots, the report’s authors told CNN.    CNN reached out to five of the top US retailers — Walmart, Kroger, Home Depot, Costco and Target — to ask: Why not invest in more rooftop solar? Many renewable energy experts point to solar as a relatively simple solution to cut down on costs and help rein in fossil fuel emissions, but the companies point to several roadblocks — regulations, labor costs and structural integrity of the rooftops themselves — that are preventing more widespread adoption. The need for these kinds of clean energy initiatives is becoming “unquestionably urgent” as the climate crisis accelerates, said Edwin Cowen, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Cornell University. “We are behind the eight ball, to put it mildly,” Cowen told CNN. “I would have loved to see policy help incentivize rooftop solar 15 years ago instead of five years ago in the commercial space. There’s still a tremendous amount of work to do.” What’s the holdup? Neumann said Walmart, the nation’s largest retailer, possesses by far the largest solar potential. Walmart has around 5,000 stores in the US and more than 783 million square feet of rooftop space — an area larger than Manhattan — and more than 8,974 gigawatt hours of annual rooftop solar potential, according to the report.  It’s enough electricity to power more than 842,000 homes, the report said.   Walmart spokesperson Mariel Messier told CNN the company is involved in renewable energy projects around the world, but many of them are not rooftop solar installations. The company has reported having completed on- and off-site wind and solar projects or had others under development with a capacity to produce more than 2.3 gigawatts of renewable energy. Neumann said Environment America has met with Walmart a few times, urging the retailer to commit to installing solar panels on roofs and in parking lots. The company has said it’s aiming to source 100% of its energy through renewable projects by 2035. “Of all the retailers in America, Walmart stands to make the biggest impact if they put rooftop solar on all of their stores,” Neumann told CNN. “And for us, this report just underscores just how much of an impact they could make if they make that decision.” According to Environment America, Walmart had installed almost 194 megawatts of solar capacity on its US facilities as of the end of the 2021 fiscal year and additional capacity in off-site solar farms. The company’s installations in California were expected to provide between 20% to 30% of each location’s electricity needs.  Target ranked No. 1 for on-site solar capacity in 2019, according to industry trade group Solar Energy Industries Association’s most recent report. It currently has 542 locations with rooftop solar — around a quarter of the company’s stores — a Target spokesperson told CNN. Rooftop solar generates enough energy to meet 15% to 40% of Target properties’ energy needs, the spokesperson said. Richard Galanti, the chief financial officer at Costco, said the company has 121 stores with rooftop solar around the world, 95 of which are in the US.  Walmart, Target and Costco did not share with CNN what their biggest barriers are to adding rooftop or parking lot solar panels to more stores.  “My suspicion is that they want an even stronger business case for deviating from business-as-usual,” Neumann said. “Historically, all those roofs have done is cover their stores, and rethinking how [they] use their buildings and thinking of them as energy generators, not just protection from rain, requires a small change in their business model.” Home Depot, which has around 2,300 stores, currently has 75 completed rooftop solar projects, 12 in construction and more than 30 planned for future development, said Craig D’Arcy, the company’s director of energy management. Solar power generates around half of these stores’ energy needs on average, he said.  Aging rooftops at stores are a “huge impediment” to solar installation, D’Arcy added. If a roof needs to be replaced in the next 15 to 20 years or sooner, it doesn’t make financial sense for Home Depot to add solar systems today, he said. “We have a goal of implementing solar rooftop where the economics are attractive,” D’Arcy told CNN.  CNN also reached out to Kroger, which owns about 2,800 stores across the US. Kristal Howard, a Kroger spokesperson, said the company currently has 15 properties — stores, distribution centers and manufacturing plants — with solar installations. One of the “multiple factors affecting the viability of a solar installation” was the stores’ ability to support a solar installation on the roofs, Howard said.  Cowen, the engineering professor at Cornell, said solar is already attractive, but that labor costs, incentives and the different layers of regulation likely pose some financial challenges in solar installations.  “For them, this means usually hiring a local site firm that can do that installation that also knows local policy,” Cowen said. “It’s just another layer of complexity that I think is beginning to make sense because the costs have come down enough, but it needs kind of reopening that door of getting into an existing building.”  Rep. Sean Casten of Illinois, who co-chairs the power sector task force in the House, said the US has “failed to provide the incentives to people who have the expertise to go in and build these things.” The reason both retail companies and the power sector have not made much progress on solar is because “our system is so disjointed” and has a complex regulation structure, Casten said. “Why aren’t we doing something that makes economic sense? The answer is this horribly disjointed federal policy where we massively subsidize fossil energy extraction, and we penalize clean energy production,” Casten told CNN. “For a long, long time, if you wanted to build a solar panel on the rooftop of Walmart, your biggest enemy was going to be your local utility because they didn’t want to lose the load. “We could have done this decades ago,” Casten added. “And had we done it, we would not be in this dire position with the climate, but we’d also have a lot more money in our pocket.” Acting on climate, equitably For Charles Callaway, director of organizing at the nonprofit group WE ACT for Environmental Justice, strengthening the rooftop solar capacity in big box retail stores is a no-brainer, especially if companies allow the local community to reap benefits either through installation jobs or sharing the electricity produced later. Either way, it would put a massive dent in curbing the climate crisis and help usher in an equitable transition away from fossil fuels — and it’s doable, Callaway told CNN.  The New York City resident led a worker training program that helped train more than 100 local community members, mostly people of color, to become solar installers. He also formed a solar workers cooperative to ensure many of the participants of the training program get jobs in a tough market.  In the last two years, Callaway said his group has not only installed solar panels on roofs of affordable housing units, but also equipment capable of producing 2 megawatts of solar energy on shopping malls up in upstate New York. He emphasized that hiring locally would be most beneficial since local installers know the community and local regulations best.   “One of my huge concerns is social equity,” Cowen said. “Access to renewable energy is a fairly privileged position these days, and we’ve got to figure out ways to make that not true.” Jasmine Graham, WE ACT’s energy justice policy manager, said the potential of building rooftop solar on big box superstores is encouraging, only “if these projects use local labor, if they are paying prevailing wages, and if this solar is being used in a manner such as community solar, which would allow [utility] bill discounts for folks that live in the same utility zone.” Pressure is mounting for global leaders to act urgently on the climate crisis after a UN report in late February warned the window for action is rapidly closing.

That includes when her son, Milo, was born last November. She shared everything from the delivery process to her postpartum life. But when it came to feeding Milo, Fink admits that pumping breast milk was a big mystery to her.  “People don’t tend to share a lot of behind the scenes about pumping,” she said. So, Fink shared her journey by recording a series of “Pump with Me” videos.  “That was something I had never seen before. And my audience has found it fascinating.” Fink said the excess milk began to pile up in her freezer.  “All I knew was that my body was producing more milk than my son currently drank in a day,” she said. Fink’s followers encouraged her to not waste the milk and donate it instead. She said at the time, she didn’t realize she could donate breast milk. She started the process by Googling, “How to donate my breast milk.”  After finding the New York Milk Bank, she went through a phone screening, online application and blood test. Fink also needed to give permission for the milk bank to access her and Milo’s medical records. While Fink started donating her excess milk before the formula shortage, she says that with the current situation, it’s needed more than ever. “It’s important to recognize that the milk sitting in your freezer is better served going to a child that’s in need right now, especially those really young babies in the NICU that are compromised because of their size and age,” she said. The response to her donations has been “overwhelmingly positive and powerful,” Fink said, and she hopes that sharing this part of her journey inspires others to do the same.  “The process was really very easy and simple, because it does sound kind of daunting.” She also has a message for mothers struggling to feed their young children right now.  “If you are impacted by the formula shortage, there are people and ways to connect to these people who have … an answer to your problem. … There is help in your community.”</Text></Article><Article paper="cnn" author="[{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;Person&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Gabriel Kinder&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;&quot;}]"><Text>When CNN Hero Aaron Jackson welcomed the first group of dogs from Ukraine to the abandoned animal shelter he’s reopened in Poland, he also took in two refugees who shared an amazing story of survival. Jackson, the founder of the non-profit Planting Peace, traveled from his Florida home to Poland shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine. He estimates that he has helped find housing for some 300 refugees, including many dog owners who struggled to stay with their pets. “If you were walking through the camps, there were just so many refugees that had brought their dogs over. And that only makes sense. It’s an extension of their family,” Jackson told CNN Jackson learned that dogs coming from Ukraine had not been allowed to mix with local dogs in Polish shelters due to concerns about disease. So, he recently found an animal shelter sitting empty in the city of Poznan and received permission to take it over. An overwhelmed rescue organization in Ukraine was the first to send dogs to Jackson’s shelter. A van carrying 17 dogs arrived, along with two refugees, Valerie Liscratenko and her mother, Liliana. “When they came to us, all I knew was that they had no money and nowhere to go,” Jackson said. “And I could see right away that they were good with dogs. … I couldn’t help but notice that all the dogs really loved (them).” He later learned that the two women spent 40 days in a Ukrainian bomb shelter caring for these dogs. “The dogs helped (them) get through the worst 40 days of (their lives), and (they) helped get those dogs through the worst 40 days of their lives,” Jackson said. Rescuing the dogs of war Through a translator, Liscratenko told CNN that she and her mother have a love for dogs in their blood. Since she was young, they had puppies at home and her mother would sometimes bring home stray dogs to provide food and medical care.  The day before the war started, they moved into the bomb shelter with the puppies in their care and secured some older dogs in the nearby factory where Liscratenko worked as a guard.  They would run back and forth from the shelter to the factory to feed them. But when the shelling got too intense to keep making the trip, they decided to bring the rest of the dogs to the bomb shelter. Liscratenko said she and her mother waited for the right moment one morning – after the overnight curfew ended and before the shelling usually began – to make their final factory run. They found some dogs were too sick or injured to come with them, but they rounded up all the dogs they could and ran them back to the bomb shelter. She said after they reached safety, a bomb exploded right where they had been running.  They did not want to leave the bomb shelter, but on May 4, Liscratenko decided to go when the drinking water became contaminated, and the people and dogs there began to get sick.  They found an animal shelter in Ukraine, and the people working there had seen Jackson’s social media posts about taking in dogs coming across the border. So, they reached out to him and arranged travel for the Liscratenkos to accompany the dogs to Poland. Starting a new life When Liscratenko and her mother arrived at Planting Peace’s animal shelter in Poland, Jackson said he could tell they were nervous and scared.  “They didn’t know Planting Peace … they’re in a new country. They don’t speak the language. We don’t speak their language,” he said.  As refugees, Jackson said Planting Peace would have helped the Liscratenkos anyway, but because they were so great with the dogs and had a strong connection with them, he hired them to work at the shelter.  “They know these dogs incredibly well. So, they were able to pass this knowledge on to the vet … ‘this dog hasn’t been eating, this dog hasn’t been drinking.’ So, this was, obviously, incredibly valuable,” he said. Liscratenko calls the dogs her children and says they had been through hell together and have reached paradise. She says that the people at the shelter do not all speak the same language but understand each other because it’s love that unites us. </Text></Article><Article paper="cnn" author="[{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;Person&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Allie Torgan&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;&quot;}]"><Text>Editor’s Note: Know someone who inspires you? Click here to nominate them as a CNN Hero. It’s not every day you meet a rabbi from Texas with a thing for underwear. But Rabbi Amy Weiss is bringing something so simple, yet essential, to those in dire need: Undies. For everyone. It’s her mission and her organization’s moniker. And by the end of this year, Weiss said Undies for Everyone will have distributed nearly 5 million pairs to children and victims of natural disasters in 16 cities across the US. Now a national program, it all started about 15 years ago when Weiss learned about the need from a social worker. “Kids who are at risk need every kind of resource that their families cannot afford to get them,” Weiss said. “Underwear is just an overlooked item, and it’s super expensive. So, the parents who are struggling financially tend to think, ‘You can’t see the underwear, so it’ll be okay.’ “ Many donations centers do not accept used underwear, so parents often throw out their children’s old pairs, which creates a gap for kids whose families rely on donated clothing. Not having clean underwear can impact a child’s self-esteem, attitude and even school attendance. And for kids living in poverty, a dose of dignity can make a huge difference. “A pair of underwear seems like a simple thing, but for our students who don’t have it, or who have been moving around from place to place, or they left in the middle of the night due to a domestic situation, clean underwear is a big deal,” said Ilka Rosado, Manager/Foster Care Liaison for the Houston Independent School District. “It goes to the core of their self-esteem. You’d be surprised how exciting a pack of new underwear can be for our students.” For years, Weiss ran underwear drives out of her home to serve children in Houston ISD, the largest public school system in Texas, where a majority of students are economically disadvantaged, according to the district. Many kids are in transitional situations or living in poverty. By 2017, as a one-woman operation, she had established relationships with about 30 schools and was on track to distribute more than 200,000 pairs of underwear in that year alone. But in August 2017, Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Texas and Louisiana. The disaster resulted in catastrophic flooding and more than 100 deaths, leaving people without food, shelter and clothing. “The whole world turned upside down,” Weiss said. “We were staying at my husband’s office. I was holding my shorts up with a phone cord.” She and her husband, Rabbi Kenny Weiss, lost their home but with support from friends and family in the Houston community, quickly pivoted to support those who had lost everything. “There was literally no new underwear to give to these people,” Weiss said. “It’s a sign of dignity for anyone who has lost everything … to have underwear makes you feel better, and it makes you feel a little normal. So we were anxious to help out.” Author Brené Brown, Weiss’s neighbor and a supporter of her organization, stepped in as well. “She posted a video and asked people to send underwear,” Weiss said. “And my computer started dinging like I had won I don’t know what … from a slot machine. I will just fast-forward and say we received 1.5 million pairs of underwear from around the world at my husband’s office.”  The influx of underwear was a game changer for Weiss’s organization. “People were coming to volunteer when they heard about what we were doing,” Weiss said. “They wanted to know if we could help other communities.” Weiss’ nonprofit partners with local Child Protective Services, Boys &amp; Girls Clubs, and Pediatric Mobile Units and relies on them to distribute the underwear. The distributions are done anonymously; Weiss and her team never meet the recipient. And that’s how Weiss wants it. “In order to give, you don’t have to show pictures of everybody and make it a big deal,” Weiss said. “It can just be because it’s the right thing to do, and you want to help people feel good and be successful.” Since 2017, Undies for Everyone has expanded to nine states and Washington, DC. The organization partners with businesses, individuals and community organizations to host “packing parties” where volunteers sort and fold underwear into bags of seven and deliver to a distribution partner. The core of the nonprofit is to serve kids between the ages 5-14 and provide them with underwear that is high quality and “fun,” said Weiss. “We want to increase these kids’ dignity, self-esteem, and confidence,” Weiss said. “And keep them in school. It will help them become more successful in social situations, in academic situations. When they’ve got underwear, they’re just feeling better and more confident. And it’s just easier to be a kid.” Want to get involved? Check out the Undies for Everyone website and see how to help.

Omicron subvariants BA.4/5 that dominated this summer are still behind the majority of infections, but newer Omicron subvariants are gaining ground. Hundreds of new forms of Omicron are being tracked by scientists, World Health Organization (WHO) officials said this week. WHO data released late on Wednesday showed that cases in the European Union reached 1.5 million last week, up 8% from the prior week, despite a dramatic fall in testing. Globally, case numbers continue to decline. Hospitalization numbers across many countries in the 27-nation bloc, as well as Britain, have gone up in recent weeks.  In the week ending October 4, Covid-19 hospital admissions with symptoms jumped nearly 32% in Italy, while intensive care admissions rose about 21%, compared to the week before, according to data compiled by independent scientific foundation Gimbe. Over the same week, Covid hospitalizations in Britain saw a 45% increase versus the week earlier. Omicron-adapted vaccines have launched in Europe as of September, with two types of shots addressing the BA.1 as well as the BA.4/5 subvariants made available alongside existing first-generation vaccines. In Britain, only the BA.1-tailored shots have been given the green light. European and British officials have endorsed the latest boosters only for a select groups of people, including the elderly and those with compromised immune systems. Complicating matters further is the “choice” of vaccine as a booster, which will likely add to confusion, public health experts said. But willingness to get yet another shot, which could be a fourth or fifth for some, is wearing thin. “For those who may be less concerned about their risk, the messaging that it is all over coupled with the lack of any major publicity campaign is likely to reduce uptake,” said Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “So on balance I fear that uptake will be quite a bit lower.” False sense of security Penny Ward, visiting professor in pharmaceutical medicine at King’s College London, said: “Another confounder is that quite a high proportion of the population might have also had a Covid episode in recent months.” Some may erroneously feel that having had a complete primary course and then having fallen ill with Covid means they will remain immune, she added. Since September 5, when the roll-out of new vaccines began in the European Union, about 40 million vaccine doses produced by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna have been delivered to member states, according to data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). However, weekly vaccine doses administered in the EU were only between 1 million and 1.4 million during September, compared with 6-10 million per week during the year-earlier period, ECDC data showed. Perhaps the biggest challenge to uptake is the perception that the pandemic is over, creating a false sense of security. “There must be some complacency in that life seems to have gone back to normal – at least with regards Covid and people now have other financial and war-related worries,” said Adam Finn, chair of ETAGE, an expert group advising the WHO on vaccine preventable diseases in Europe. He added that some law-makers, too, were dropping the ball. Italy’s Gimbe science foundation said the government, soon to be replaced after an election, was ill prepared for the autumn-winter season, and highlighted that a publication on the government’s management of the pandemic had been blocked. The health ministry declined to comment. Meanwhile, British officials last week warned that renewed circulation of flu and a resurgence in Covid-19 could pile pressure on the already stretched National Health Service.</Text></Article><Article paper="cnn" author="[{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;Person&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Etant Dupain&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;Person&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Hande Atay Alam&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;&quot;}]"><Text>Haiti’s government has asked for international military assistance as it grapples with interlocked health, energy and security crises, according to a statement from Jean-Junior Joseph, advisor to Haiti’s Prime Minister.  “After serious reflections, facing a dire humanitarian crisis in Haiti, where hospitals are not having enough energy to function, cholera is back inside the shanties, it was decided in the Council of Ministers last night, October 7th to request military assistance from the international community to deal with such unbelievable humanitarian crisis,” reads the statement sent to CNN on Thursday.  It was not clear which countries the government requested military assistance from.  The request came after Haitian Prime Minister Ariel Henry called for international help during a televised speech to the nation on Wednesday night.  “I am calling the international community to help us, to support us in every necessary way to avoid the situation worsening. We need to be able to distribute water, and medicine as cholera is making a comeback,” said Henry. “We need to reopen businesses and clear the roads for doctors and nurses to be able to do work. We asking for their help to be able to distribute the fuel and for school to reopen,” he added. Dozens more cases of cholera have been diagnosed in Haiti, adding new urgency to warnings of the Caribbean nation’s descent into chaos amid political and economic crises. The deadly infection has already killed eight people, according to Haiti’s health ministry, and 68 new cases have been identified in the first week of October according to the medical humanitarian group, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). The burgeoning new public health emergency could hardly come at a worse time.  Anti-government protests – now in their seventh week – have paralyzed the country, with schools, businesses, and public transportation across the country mostly shuttered. Since August 22, Haitians have been demonstrating against chronic gang violence, poverty, food insecurity, inflation, and fuel shortages. Their fury was further fueled last month when Prime Minister Ariel Henry announced that he would cut fuel subsidies in order to fund the government – a move that would double prices at the pump. Haiti’s powerful gangs have exacerbated the fuel crisis by blocking the country’s main port in the capital city Port-au-Prince. Thousands of Haitian people continue to protest in various cities across the country, calling on the government to step down. </Text></Article><Article paper="cnn" author="[{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;Person&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Rob Picheta&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.cnn.com/profiles/rob-picheta&quot;}]"><Text>Human rights groups from Russia and Ukraine – Memorial and the Center for Civil Liberties – have won the Nobel Peace Prize for 2022, along with the jailed Belarusian advocate Ales Bialiatski. The new laureates were honored for “an outstanding effort to document war crimes, human right abuses and the abuse of power” in their respective countries. “They have for many years promoted the right to criticize power and protect the fundamental rights of citizens,” the Norwegian Nobel Committee said. Their win comes seven months after Russia waged a full-scale war on Ukraine, with the assistance of Belarus. That ongoing conflict loomed heavily over this year’s award, and it had been speculated that the committee would seek to pay tribute to activists in the affected nations. The Ukrainian group, Center for Civil Liberties, has “engaged in efforts to identify and document Russian war crimes against the Ukrainian civilian population” since the invasion was launched in February, the committee said.  “In collaboration with international partners, the center is playing a pioneering role with a view to holding the guilty parties accountable for their crimes.” The head of the Center for Civil Liberties said the group was “proud” to win the prize, calling it “a recognition of work of many human rights activists in Ukraine and not only in Ukraine.” Oleksandra Matviichuk, the organization’s head, said on Facebook she was “happy” that the Center had received the prize “together with our friends and partners.” She also called for the creation of an international tribunal to prosecute Russian President Vladimir Putin and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko for war crimes.  Matviichuk also said Russia should be “thrown out” of the UN Security Council for what she called “systemic breaches of the UN Charter.” Memorial was founded in 1987 and, after the fall of the Soviet Union, became one of Russia’s most prominent human rights watchdogs. It has worked to expose the abuses and atrocities of the Stalinist era. The group was shut down by Russian courts in the past year, in a major blow to the country’s hollowed-out civil rights landscape. Bialiatski, meanwhile, has documented human rights abuses in Belarus since the 1980s. He founded the organization Viasna, or Spring, in 1996 after a referendum that consolidated the authoritarian powers of president and close Russian ally, Lukashenko. The activist was arrested in 2020 amid widespread protests against Lukashenko’s regime. “He is still detained without trial. Despite tremendous personal hardship, Mr Bialiatski has not yielded an inch in his fight for human rights and democracy in Belarus,” the committee said. Belarusian opposition politician Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya congratulated Bialiatski. “The prize is an important recognition for all Belarusians fighting for freedom &amp; democracy,” she wrote in a tweet. “All political prisoners must be released without delay.” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen applauded the “outstanding courage of the women and men standing against autocracy.”  And French President Emmanuel Macron tweeted that the Nobel committee had honored “the unwavering defenders of human rights in Europe.” “Artisans of peace, they know they can count on the support of France,” Macron added. It had been widely anticipated that the Nobel decision-makers would focus attention on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, given its aftershocks in security and stability across the globe. But those involved in leading military campaigns, such as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, were seen as longshots given that government-led peace negotiations appear to offer slim hopes of a resolution to the conflict in the near future.  “The committee is giving a message about the importance of political freedoms, civil liberties and an active civil society as being part of what makes for a peaceful society,” Dan Smith, director of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, told CNN. “I think that’s a very important message.” “This prize has a lot of layers on it; it’s covering a lot of ground and giving more than one message,” he added. “(It is) a prize about citizenship, and what is the best kind of citizenship if we wish to be citizens of peaceful countries in a peaceful world.” “This year we were in a situation with a war in Europe, which was most unusual, but also facing a war that has a global effect on people all over the world,” Berit Reiss-Andersen, the chair of the committee, told reporters. Reiss-Andersen said the prize was not intended to send a message to Putin or any other individual. But she added that he represents “an authoritarian government that is suppressing human rights activists.” The three winners will share the prize money of 10,000,000 Swedish krona ($900,000). The Nobel Prizes will be officially awarded to the laureates at a ceremony on December 10, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel’s death.

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.  The Islamic regime in Iran has ruled for decades with fear and intimidation.  Outrage at the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22 year-old who died after being detained by Iran’s morality policy, allegedly for improperly wearing her hijab, ignited nationwide protests across the country that have gone on for weeks.  That Iranians are risking their lives and freedom to stand up to their government has sparked hope among many that change is coming. Read CNN’s latest report. I talked on the phone to Masih Alinejad, an Iranian in exile in the US who works as a journalist and activist. Key points: Our conversation, edited for clarity and length, is below. I’ve also added some context and links in parentheses where appropriate. ‘A women’s revolution against a gender apartheid regime’ WHAT MATTERS: This newsletter is not usually focused on Iran. Can you first just explain what’s happening? ALINEJAD: Mahsa Amini was only 22 years old. … She came from Saqqez to Tehran for a vacation. Then she got arrested by the so-called morality police – because I call them the hijab police.  And for your audience, if they don’t know what morality police means, they’re a bunch of police walking in the streets, telling people whether their way of wearing hijab is proper or not.  Mahsa was arrested for wearing inappropriate hijab. So she was not unveiled.   (Here is a CNN report in which the Iranian police deny the allegation she was beaten.)  ALINEJAD: That created huge anger among Iranians. And that is why women across Iran first started to cut their hair. Then they took to the street and they started to burn their headscarves. And now, with men, shoulder to shoulder, across Iran they’re not only saying no to compulsory hijab, they are actually chanting against the dictator and they are saying we want an end to the Islamic Republic.  This is a revolution.  To me, this is a women’s revolution against a gender apartheid regime. Iran’s crackdown has not stopped protests WHAT MATTERS: The Iranian government has tried to crack down on this. We see video that gets out of Iran of these protests. How have things changed in the weeks since Mahsa’s death?  ALINEJAD: From the beginning, the level of crackdown was so brutal. They opened fire, they really opened fire on teenagers, school leaders, university students, they opened fire on unarmed people.  Now some reports say more than 130 people have been killed. But it’s strongly believed the number is much more than this. Only in Zahedan on only one day, they opened fire on those who were praying. Who were praying. They killed more than 80 people in Zahedan.   (CNN has not verified all of these claims. Related CNN report: Iranian security forces beat, shot and detained students of elite Tehran university, witnesses say. Amnesty International has reported on the killing of 66 in Zahedan along with other deaths recorded in other places.  Regarding death tolls: CNN cannot independently verify the death toll –  a precise figure is impossible for anyone outside the Iranian government to confirm – and different estimates have been given by opposition groups, international rights organizations and local journalists.)  ALINEJAD: The Iranian regime cut off the internet in some cities to prevent the rest of the world from getting to know about the crackdown, to get to learn about the number of people killed.  But again. That didn’t stop people. Actually, it changed the tone of the protesters. They became more angry. They were holding the names and photos of those who got killed and the major slogan was this: ‘We are ready to die, but we won’t live under humiliation.’  One of the young women whose name was Hadis Najafi, she was only 20 years old. She made a video of herself walking in the street and saying I’m joining the protests. In the future, if I see that Iran has changed, that change came, then I was proudly part of this demonstration. She got killed. There are many of them.   (CNN has reported that Najafi’s family said she was shot six times and never made it home from a protest. She was 23. There are reports of multiple young women killed. Here’s a CNN video report on Nika Shahkarami, whose family found her body at a morgue after not being able to find her for 10 days following an Instagram story of her burning her headscarf.)  Students filmed themselves burning their headscarves, but they got killed. But murdering and killing didn’t stop the protests. Instead they became more angry. Now schoolgirls came out, university professors came out, teachers came out and ask for a strike.  (Here’s a CNN report that explains the special significance of strikes in Iran.)  Women have been pushing back on a smaller scale for years WHAT MATTERS: The flashpoint is one woman’s death that set off all of these protests. But it’s a movement that’s been building for months – ALINEJAD: Don’t say for months. I don’t accept that. It has been building for years. Years of women pushing back the boundaries the anti-woman laws, especially compulsory hijab laws.  For years and years, these women that you see in the streets, they have been fighting back compulsory hijabs alone. Like lonely soldiers. I myself have published videos of women being beaten by morality police under the hashtag #mycameraismyweapon. I really want you to go and check this hashtag. Brave women filming themselves while being harassed by morality police and looking to the morality police and saying that you cannot tell me what to wear. Slavery used to be legal. I’m not going to respect bad law in Iran. This is being built up by women within the society practicing their civil disobedience in bravely saying no to forced hijab and the gender apartheid regime for years and years. That’s my opinion. Mahsa’s name became a symbol of resistance for women to take to the streets in large numbers. That’s the new thing.  What’s next for these protests? Can they be sustained? WHAT MATTERS: How will this be transformed into permanent change? How will it evolve from here?  ALINEJAD: Look, this is not going to happen overnight. This is the beginning of an end. It takes time. It reminds me of the revolution 40 years ago. People were taking to the streets for like one month and were going back home and then coming back again. The national strike helped a lot. For me and millions of people, this is just the beginning to an end. The compulsory hijab is not just a small piece of cloth for Iranians. It’s like the Berlin Wall. I keep saying that. If women can successfully tear this wall down, the Islamic Republic won’t exist.  Maybe in the West, people ignore me and they never take this seriously. But the Supreme Leader of Iran, Ali Khamenei, he knows what I’m talking about. That’s why, just two days ago, he referred to my statement comparing the hijab to the Berlin Wall, saying that ‘she is an American agent and we have taken action against her.’   (Alinejad shared this video of Khamenei on Twitter, in which he refers to US political elements making the comparison to the Berlin Wall.)  ALINEJAD: But it’s not me. It’s millions of people who believe that compulsory hijab is like the main pillar of the religious dictatorship. It’s like the main pillar of the Islamic Republic.  That’s why I believe that now people are being fearless and clear that we want to break this weakest pillar of the Islamic Republic… I strongly believe that the biggest threat to the Islamic Republic are the women who are leading the revolution, who are facing guns and bullets and saying that we want an end for this gender apartheid regime.   The importance of social media and the failure  of social media companies WHAT MATTERS: In Iran, and we’ve seen this in Russia as well, social media is helping spread the word and is essential to organizing protests. Here in the US, it is often viewed as a threat to our democracy because that’s where misinformation is spread. I wonder if you had any thoughts on that dichotomy. ALINEJAD: Let me be very clear with you. Right now, the tech companies are actually helping the Islamic Republic. First of all, Iranians are banned from using social media – Instagram, Facebook and Twitter are filtered. The leaders like Khamenei and other officials who ban 80 million people from using social media, they all have verified accounts. They have multiple accounts on social media. Basically, the Iranian regime cut off the Internet for its own people, but they’re being more than welcomed on social media to spread fake information, misinformation, disinformation.  (Accounts that appear to be associated with Khamenei are on Twitter and Instagram and have large followings. They are not verified by Instagram or Twitter. Twitter did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for Meta said this in an email: “Iranians use apps like Instagram to stay close to their loved ones, find information and shed light on important events - and we hope the Iranian authorities restore their access soon. In the meantime, our teams are following the situation closely, and are focused on only removing content that breaks our rules, while addressing any enforcement mistakes as quickly as possible.”)  The Biden administration expressed support for protesters… and is also trying to make a deal with the regime WHAT MATTERS: The US government has tried to increase Iranian’s access to the internet. Is that working? ALINEJAD: Oh, of course, this is phenomenal. But we need more. We need more. The thing is, at the same time, the US government, we’re pleased that they’re providing internet access for Iranians. This is good. We appreciate that.  But at the same time, the US government is focused on getting a deal from this regime, the same regime.  They condemn the brutality, they condemn the Iranian government for killings, but at the same time, they try to give money, billions of dollars, to the same murderers. And I don’t understand this contradiction.   (The US government could give Iran’s government ​access to billions of dollars of frozen Iranian funds if it re-joins an agreement whereby Iran can sell oil in exchange for abandoning nuclear weapons capability. Recent talks, however, have not gone well. Read more.)  A plea to further isolate Iran ALINEJAD: Many people in the streets are now risking their lives and want an end for the same regime. They aren’t asking for US government to go there and save them at all. They’re brave enough to do it themselves. But they’re really clearly asking the US government not to save the Iranian regime. … People believe that the money goes to the benefit of the people. It doesn’t go to the people. The money goes to Syria, Lebanon, to Hamas, Hezbollah, to terrorist organizations.  For millions of Iranians now, this is the moment they want the US government to ask its allies, the European countries, to recall their ambassadors and to cut their ties with the murders until the day that they are sure that the Iranian regime is stopped killing its own people.   (CNN isn’t able to confirm that all the money goes to terrorist organizations or that none of it goes to Iranian people. Iran does fund terror groups outside its borders, according to the US government, and its own Islamic Revolutionary Guard is a terror group, according to the US government.)  Western feminism compared with Iran’s new feminism WHAT MATTERS: I want to talk about another dichotomy you’ve pointed out. You wrote in The Washington Post that feminists all over the world need to pay attention and take to the streets.  ALINEJAD: You cannot call yourself a feminist in the West, in America, and not take action on one of the most important feminist revolutions, in Iran.  By saying that, I don’t mean that I want the feminists to just appear on TV and cut their hair to show their solidarity.  I want, especially the female politicians, to cut their ties … and instead take to the streets to show their solidarity with the women of Iran. When the Women’s March happened here in America, like every single feminist around the world showed solidarity. I was part of the Women’s March in New York. The main slogan was ‘my body my choice.’  But at the same time I’m witnessing that when it comes to Iran and Afghanistan, it seems that my body my choice is not as important as it is in the West.   (Here Alinejad said women representing Western governments who meet with Iranian and Afghan officials should refrain from wearing headscarves.)  A union of dissidents to fight the autocrats WHAT MATTERS: You took part this week in an Oslo Freedom Forum event in New York with other dissidents from Russia and Venezuela. Those are two places that are repressive, and they’re also funded largely by oil. The US wants more oil on the market. I just wondered if you had any larger comments to make on this question?  ALINEJAD: This is what’s missing here. The dictators are more united than our freedom fighters. Let me give you an example. Just two months ago, (Vladimir) Putin went to Iran. (Nicolás) Maduro from Venezuela went to Iran … from China to Russia to Venezuela to Nicaragua, everywhere. The leaders from autocracies and dictatorships are united. They’re helping each other. They’re supporting each other to oppress protests taking place in each country. But we the freedom fighters, we the opposition to these dictators must be united as well, because when we fight against autocracy or dictatorship on our own, we’re not going to be successful.  (Alinejad said she has talked to dissidents from Russia and Venezuela about calling a World Liberty Congress for opposition and activist leaders.)  ALINEJAD: If we don’t get united to end dictatorship, then the dictators will get united to end democracy. We’re not fighting just for ourselves. I’m not fighting just for Iran. Garry Kasparov is not fighting for just Russia. Leopoldo Lopez is not fighting just for Venezuela. We are fighting for democracy. We’re trying to protect the rest of the world from these dictators.  (Our conversation continued from here and Alinejad argued the “United Nations is useless.” It’s true the United Nations prioritizes inclusion of most countries over action. And it is awkward at best that Iran sits on the UN’s Commission on Women’s Rights and Russia sits on the Security Council.)  ALINEJAD: We need to have our own alternative United Nations, where all the good people get united, not the bad guys. Now the bad guys are winning because they’re helping each other. So this is the time that all the good people who care for freedom and democracy get united and have their own society. </Text></Article><Article paper="cnn" author="[{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;Person&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Jessie Yeung&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.cnn.com/profiles/jessie-yeung&quot;},{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;Person&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Paula Hancocks&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.cnn.com/profiles/paula-hancocks&quot;},{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;Person&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Yoonjung Seo&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.cnn.com/profiles/yoonjung-seo&quot;}]"><Text>Tensions are running high in the Korean Peninsula, as the United States and its allies respond to North Korea’s flurry of recent missile tests – including one that flew over neighboring Japan without warning. North Korea has fired six missiles in the past two weeks – a prolific number, even in a year that has seen the highest number of launches since leader Kim Jong Un took power in 2011. The aggressive acceleration in weapons testing has sparked alarm in the region, with the US, South Korea and Japan responding with missile launches and joint military exercises this week. The US has also redeployed an aircraft carrier into waters near the peninsula, a move South Korean authorities called “very unusual.”  International leaders are now watching for signs of a further escalation such as a potential nuclear test, which would be the hermit nation’s first in nearly five years – a move that would present US President Joe Biden with a new potential foreign policy crisis. Here’s what you need to know about North Korea’s rush toward nuclear weapons and intercontinental missiles, why they’re ramping up now – and what, if anything, the US can do to counter Kim Jong Un. First, some context The testing itself isn’t new – North Korea’s weapons development program has been ongoing for years. Tensions reached near-crisis levels in 2017 when North Korea launched 23 missiles throughout the year, including two over Japan, as well as conducting a nuclear test. The tests showcased weapons with enough power to put most of the world in range, including the country’s first intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM).  Relations thawed in 2018, when then-US President Donald Trump held a landmark summit with Kim. The two leaders “fell in love,” Trump said; in return, Kim praised their “special” relationship. North Korea pledged to freeze missile launches and appeared to destroy several facilities at the nuclear test site, while the US suspended large-scale military exercises with South Korea and other regional allies. But the talks ultimately fell apart, and hopes for a deal that would see the North curtail its nuclear ambitions dwindled by the end of Trump’s term. Then the Covid-19 pandemic hit, pushing North Korea further into isolation. The already-impoverished country sealed its borders entirely, with foreign diplomats and aid workers fleeing en masse. During this time, the number of missile launches also remained low – just four in 2020 and eight in 2021.  So why are they ramping up now? Experts say there are a few reasons North Korea is accelerating its testing so rapidly now. First, it could simply be the right time after the events of the last few years, with Kim declaring victory against Covid in August, and a new US administration in place that has focused on shows of unity with South Korea. “They’ve been unable to test for quite a few years due to political considerations, so I’d expect North Korean engineers and generals to be very eager to make sure their toys are going to work well,” said Andrei Lankov, a professor at South Korea’s Kookmin University. Jeffrey Lewis, a weapons expert and professor at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, said it’s also normal for North Korea to pause testing during the stormy summer and resume once weather improved in the fall.  But, several experts said, Kim could also be sending a message by deliberately showcasing North Korea’s arsenal during a period of heightened global conflict.  “They want to remind the world that they should not be ignored, that they exist and their engineers are working around the clock to develop both nuclear weapons and delivery systems,” said Lankov. Carl Schuster, a former director of operations at the US Pacific Command’s Joint Intelligence Center in Hawaii, echoed this sentiment. Kim “launches missiles to generate attention towards himself, but also to create pressure for Japan and the United States to engage him,” he said. He added that North Korea might also feel emboldened to act now while the West is distracted with the war in Ukraine. “(The missile tests) started in January, which is about the time we were beginning to report on what Russian President Vladimir Putin was doing opposite Ukraine,” said Schuster. “Kim Jong Un is doing what he thinks he can get away with – he’s not expecting any kind of strong US reaction.” Lankov said that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine may have also boosted Kim’s confidence because “it demonstrated that if you have nuclear weapons, you can have almost impunity. And if you don’t have nuclear weapons, you’re in trouble.” What can the US and its allies do to stop North Korea? Despite the US and its allies’ quick military response this past week, experts say there’s little they can do to stop or prepare for North Korea’s weapons tests. “The Americans sent the Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier. South Koreans are launching these missiles, which are not necessarily working well,” said Lankov, referring to a South Korean missile on Wednesday that crashed right after launch. “What is the impact of all these American aircraft carriers cruising around Korea? Pretty much nothing.”  Though these shows of force might serve to deter North Korea from “starting a war” – which likely isn’t Kim’s plan, anyway – it does little to prevent further weapons development or missile testing,” he said. “It’ll probably make some people in the US and (South Korea) a bit happier, but it’ll have zero impact on North Korea’s behavior and decision making.” A lack of hard intelligence also means the US is largely left in the dark when it comes to Kim’s plans. The North lacks the widespread use of technology that not only facilitates economic and societal advances, but also provides critical windows and opportunities to glean information for the intelligence services of the US and its allies. “Since so much of what North Korea does is driven by the leader himself, you really have to get inside his head, and that’s a hard intelligence problem,” said Chris Johnstone, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. And on the international stage, the US’ efforts to punish North Korea have faltered due to pushback from Moscow and Beijing. In May, Russia and China vetoed a US-drafted UN resolution to strengthen sanctions on North Korea for its weapons testing – the first time either country had blocked a sanction vote against the North since 2006. What is North Korea trying to achieve? Kim has spearheaded an aggressive weapons development program that far outstripped efforts by his father and grandfather, both former North Korean leaders – and experts say the country’s nuclear program is at the heart of Kim’s ambitions. In September, North Korea passed a law declaring itself a nuclear weapons state, with Kim vowing to “never give up” nuclear weapons. The law also demonstrated North Korea’s hopes of strengthening its ties with China and Russia, said Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul.  After China and Russia’s open opposition to new sanctions against North Korea, Kim “knows he has their backing,” said Schuster. He added that Kim’s weapons testing serves a dual purpose: apart from making a statement to the international community, it also boosts his own image domestically and cements the regime’s power. “It’s a very paranoid regime – (Kim) is as worried about the people under him as he is worried about regime change from the outside,” said Schuster. With the tests, Kim, is telling his own senior people, “We can deal with whatever the threat the West, the US and South Korea can come up with,” he said. However, in terms of wider public perception, KCNA, North Korea’s state-run media, has made no mention of missile launches for months – since its last report of a launch in March. Lewis, the expert at the Middlebury Institute, added that North Korea will likely continue developing weapons such as ICBMs and submarine-launched ballistic missile until “they get to a point where they’re satisfied with that – then I think they’ll probably express an interest in talking again.” Is a nuclear test coming? The concern in the short-term is whether North Korea will launch a nuclear test, which Lewis said could come “anytime.” However, Schuster and Lankov both said that given the friendly relationship between North Korea and China, Kim might wait until after China holds its high-profile Communist Party Congress later this month – if it happens at all. The meeting of the party elite is the most significant event on the Chinese political calendar – especially so this year, with Chinese leader Xi Jinping expected to be appointed to a third term in power, further cementing his status as the most powerful Chinese leader in decades. Kim “depends too much on Chinese aid to keep his country afloat,” meaning he can’t afford to “do anything to detract from the Party Congress,” said Schuster. “So although China can’t dictate to him what he must do … he will not cause them problems.” After October, however, the runway is clear for any more significant weapons tests, said Lankov. South Korean and US officials have been warning since May that North Korea may be preparing for a nuclear test, with satellite imagery showing activity at its underground nuclear test site.

Launched Friday, the licensing round won’t lead to new UK production for several years. And when drilling does begin, Britain will still be dependent on energy imports, according to the government, leaving it vulnerable to soaring prices and supply disruptions of the kind that threaten blackouts this winter. UK utilities company National Grid\n            \n                (NGG) warned Thursday that households and businesses could be left without power for up to three hours at a time in a worst-case scenario of very cold weather, low levels of wind, gas shortages and an inability to import electricity from Europe. It said it would take steps to mitigate the risk, including bringing old coal-fired power stations back online if necessary. Starting November 1, National Grid will also offer financial incentives to customers to reduce power consumption at peak times. Kathryn Porter, an energy consultant at Watt-Logic, told CNN Business that National Grid was still underestimating the risks to supply, but that blackouts for households were unlikely because it could disconnect large energy users at peak times if necessary. Climate concerns The latest licensing round won’t improve the immediate supply picture and could face a legal challenge from environmental activists. Greenpeace said that new oil and gas licenses were “potentially unlawful” and that it would be looking for ways to act. “New oil and gas licenses won’t lower energy bills for struggling families this winter or any winter soon nor provide energy security in the medium term,” Philip Evans, energy transition campaigner for Greenpeace UK, said in a statement. “New licenses — and more importantly more fossil fuels — solve neither of those problems but will make the climate crisis even worse,” he added.  Analysis by the North Sea Transition Authority (NSTA), the regulator that grants licenses, shows the average time between discovery of oil and gas deposits and first production is close to five years, though that lag is “falling.” In a statement on Friday, the NSTA said it will prioritize areas in the southern North Sea that can be developed quickly and where gas has already been discovered. Companies have until January 12 to apply for licenses, with permits expected to be issued as soon as the second quarter of 2023. The NSTA said the licensing round has been subject to a “climate compatibility check” to ensure it aligns with the UK government’s commitment to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. It added that producing gas domestically has a much lower carbon footprint than importing it from abroad. The International Energy Agency said last year that investment in new fossil fuel supply projects, including drilling for oil and gas, must stop immediately if the world is to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. The UK government set out plans earlier this year to generate 95% of Britain’s electricity from low carbon sources by 2030. The plan, which allows drilling for oil and gas, will also ramp up nuclear power and wind energy.</Text></Article><Article paper="cnn" author="[{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;Person&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Gad Levanon for CNN Business Perspectives&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;&quot;}]"><Text>Editor’s Note: Gad Levanon is the chief economist at the Burning Glass Institute. He’s the former head of The Conference Board’s Labor Market Institute. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. To many economists and analysts, the US economy has represented a paradox this year. On the one hand, GDP growth has slowed significantly, and some argue, even entered a recession. On the other hand, overall employment growth has been much stronger than normal. While GDP declined at an annualized rate of 1.1% in the first half of 2022, the US economy added 2.3 million jobs in the last six months, far more than in any other six-month period in the 20 years prior to the pandemic.   This tight labor market – and the rapid wage growth it has spurred – is causing inflation to become more entrenched. The Consumer Price Index, which measures a basket of goods and services, was 8.3% year-over-year in August. That’s lower than the 40-year high of 9.1% in June, but still painfully high. To address it, the Federal Reserve is likely to drive the economy into a recession in 2023, crushing continued job growth. Why has employment growth remained so strong? First, the US economy is holding on better than many expected. The Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow estimate for real GDP growth in the third quarter of 2022 is 2.3%, suggesting that while the economy is now growing much more slowly than it did last year, we are still not in a recession. When the demand for goods and services strengthens, so does the demand for workers producing these goods and services. Second, despite the slowing of the economy and the growing fears of recession, layoffs are still historically low. Initial claims for unemployment insurance, an indicator highly correlated with layoffs, were 219,000 for the week ended October 1 – higher than the week prior, but still one of the lowest readings in recent decades. After years of increasingly traumatic labor shortages, many employers are reluctant to significantly reduce the number of workers even as their businesses are slowing. That’s because companies are worried that they will have trouble recruiting new workers when they start expanding again. Third, many industries are growing faster than normal because they are still recovering from the pandemic. Convention and trade show organizers, car rental companies, nursing homes and child day care services, among others, are all growing fast because they are still well below pre-pandemic employment levels. Fourth, just as some industries are growing because they are still catching up, others are experiencing high growth as they adjust to a new normal of higher demand. Demand for data processing and hosting services, semiconductor manufacturing, mental health services, testing laboratories, medical equipment and pharmaceutical manufacturing is higher than before the pandemic. And it’s likely that these represent structural changes to buying patterns that will keep demand high. Fifth, during the pandemic, corporate investments in software and R&amp;D reached unprecedented levels, which drove a rapid increase in new STEM jobs. Because these workers are especially well paid, they have had plenty of disposable income to spend on goods and services, which has supported job growth throughout the economy. These factors are spurring positive momentum that will not disappear overnight. Employment growth is likely to slow down from its historically high rates, but it will still remain solid in the coming months. ManpowerGroup’s Employment Outlook Survey shows that the hiring intentions for the fourth quarter are still very high, despite dropping from the previous quarter. Next year, however, will look very different. Many of the industries that are still recovering from the pandemic will have reached pre-pandemic employment levels. With demand saturated, those industries may revert to slower hiring. But this alone is unlikely to push job growth into negative territory. What will do that is monetary policy. There are two ways to rein in the labor market: Either reduce demand for workers or increase the labor supply. But it’s hard to engineer a boost in labor supply. That takes the kind of legislative action needed to increase immigration, drive people into the labor force or grow investment in workforce training. This is likely to prove elusive in today’s polarized political environment.  The only option that leaves the Fed is to engineer a recession by continuing to raise interest rates.  Expect to see that happen in 2023.</Text></Article><Article paper="cnn" author="[{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;Person&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Nicole Goodkind&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.cnn.com/profiles/nicole-goodkind&quot;}]"><Text>A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business’ Before the Bell newsletter.

The White House isn’t very happy with OPEC’s decision to slash oil production by 2 million barrels per day. Consumers won’t be big fans either, as the move will likely send gas prices higher. But there’s one big winner coming out of the ordeal: Oil stocks.  What’s happening: The cartel of major oil producers and its allies, led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, announced on Wednesday its biggest production cut since the start of the pandemic. The reduction, equivalent to about 2% of global oil demand, won’t begin until November, but prices received an immediate boost.  Oil prices rose to three-week highs after the announcement. Brent crude, the international benchmark, was hovering just below $95 per barrel on Friday morning, up about 6% since Monday.  US oil and gas stocks have flourished as a result. The S&amp;P 500 energy sector — which includes stocks like Exxon Mobil\n            \n                (XOM), Chevron\n            \n                (CVX) and Phillips 66\n            \n                (PSX) — is up nearly 15% for the week, while the index as a whole is up just 3.7%.  That’s because supply cuts mean higher profits for energy companies. “Big picture, this means higher oil prices and higher cash flows,” said Stephen Ellis, a senior analyst at Morningstar. The production cut will lead to higher dividends and stock buybacks among energy companies, he said.  So far, energy companies have had an exceptional year. Exxon Mobil is up more than 60% year to date, Halliburton\n            \n                (HAL) is up nearly 25% and Occidental Petroleum\n            \n                (OXY), boosted by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway\n            \n                (BRKA) drastically increasing its stake in the company, is up 127%. The S&amp;P 500 is down about 22% for the same period.  The big picture: Energy companies in the United States and Europe have made eye-popping profits this year as supply crises raise crude oil prices.  Exxon’s profit, excluding special items, came to $17.6 billion in the second quarter of 2022, up 273% from the same period a year ago. Chevron’s second-quarter profit similarly rose by 277% from the year prior. Energy companies have largely used those profits to attract and reward shareholders — making their stocks all the more attractive. Major oil and gas companies are on course to repurchase near-record levels of shares this year. Estimates from Bernstein Research show that the seven largest companies, including Exxon Mobil, Chevron, BP\n            \n                (BP) and Shell\n            \n                (SHLX), are poised to return $38 billion to shareholders through buybacks this year. That would be almost quadruple the $10 billion in buybacks completed in 2021.  “Companies are much more focused on shareholders than they have been in the past,” said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial. “As a result, the sector is being rewarded. The overall analyst consensus is that clients should invest in these companies, even when they sell off.”   The takeaway: The energy sector single-handedly saved the stock market in the second quarter, and it appears on track to do the same this quarter. This OPEC announcement could make 2022 the year of big energy. Here comes unemployment Investors are holding their breath this morning as they await the release of the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ latest monthly jobs report. All eyes will be on whether the labor market is showing signs of loosening up — one of the most crucial factors that will help the Federal Reserve determine its next steps in the fight against decades-high inflation. The US economy is expected to have added 250,000 jobs in September, which would be the lowest monthly jobs gain since December 2020, according to Refinitiv estimates. If numbers come in as estimates suggest, investors will likely be very happy. A weakening labor market will exert downward pressure on wages and inflation: That means the Fed’s policy is working and that it might pivot away from aggressive interest rate hikes. August jobs data already indicated that the historically tight labor market has loosened by a notch, reports my colleague Alicia Wallace. The jobs report for that month found that America added 315,000 positions, a much lower level than the 512,000 average monthly gain over the past 12 months. But while the hotly anticipated headline jobs number is falling, it’s still robust, BLS data shows. The monthly average prior to the pandemic was around 200,000. The corner of Wall Street and Pennsylvania Avenue The midterm elections are a little more than a month away, and Wall Street is hoping for gridlock. That’s because investors actually prefer it when politicians bicker and little actually gets done, reports my colleague Paul R. La Monica. Power splits in DC mean big returns in NYC. According to data from Edelman Financial Engines, the S&amp;P 500 has had an annualized return of 16.9% during the nine years since 1948 when a Democrat was in the White House and Republicans had a majority in both chambers of Congress. “Should Republicans take the House at a minimum, equities are likely to react positively based on the proposition that continued gridlock in Washington is good for business due to the absence of major tax and policy changes,” Daniel Berkowitz, senior investment officer for Prudent Management Associates, said in a report. But investors shouldn’t sweat the election outcome too much. Stocks tend to go up over the long haul — regardless of politics. The average annual market returns since 1948 during periods of full Democratic control is a still solid 15.1%. Stocks posted an average 15.9% gain when Republicans were in charge. The bottom line: Markets should worry less about election results and more about the elections themselves. Dan Clifton, head of Washington research at Strategas Asset Management, noted in a report that the S&amp;P 500 has declined, on average, by about 19% in midterm election years prior to votes being cast. But the market then tends to bottom by October. Up next The Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its September jobs report at 8:30 a.m. ET.   Coming next week: Third quarter earnings season begins.

A top local union warned Thursday of “a record number of resignations from the company’s most experienced pilots,” claiming that Cathay “has lost over 40% of its captains and first officers.” In a statement, the Hong Kong Aircrew Officers Association (HKAOA) said that the carrier was “unprepared to regain its industry leadership position, threatening the status of Hong Kong as a global aviation hub.”  The group cited a breakdown in negotiations on pay, among other working conditions.  Hong Kong’s flagship airline is “facing unprecedented staffing and training shortages,” and “stands unprepared to fully resume its operations, failing to meet demand in a resurgent travel market,” the HKAOA said. Like most airlines, Cathay has been pummeled during the pandemic. Once known as a premier employer, the carrier last year grappled with falling morale, a spike in resignations and mounting frustration as staff underwent Hong Kong’s arduous quarantine measures, which were some of the world’s strictest.  But, this month Hong Kong ended its two and a half years of quarantine measures, leading to a surge in demand for outbound travel.  The news brought some much-needed relief to Cathay, which was forced to slash capacity to as little as 2% of pre-pandemic levels during the global health crisis. In recent weeks, Cathay has said it will add hundreds of new flight services in response to the relaxation of border controls. It even set up a virtual “waiting room” for its booking website as customers flooded its platform to buy tickets. Now, the company is finding itself on the defense once again as pilots warn of continued workplace issues. When asked for comment Thursday, a Cathay Pacific spokesperson told CNN Business that it “has sufficient qualified and experienced aviation professionals to continue to support the current operation and operate at the highest levels of safety and customer service.” “We remain focused on building connectivity between Hong Kong and the world as swiftly as we possibly can. However, it will still take time to rebuild our capacity as we build operational readiness and undertake a substantial amount of training and aircraft reactivation,” the spokesperson said. The company has already started a huge recruitment drive to enlist “more than 4,000 frontline employees to meet Cathay Pacific’s operational needs over the next 18-24 months,” the spokesperson added. “We believe our contracts for pilots are competitive contracts.” But as Hong Kong reopens after the pandemic other airlines are deciding on a different approach. On Wednesday, Virgin Atlantic announced it is closing its Hong Kong office and not resuming services between the Asian hub and London’s Heathrow Airport.  “Significant operational complexities due to the ongoing Russian airspace closure have contributed to the commercial decision not to resume flights in March 2023 as planned,” the company said.  Flights between London Heathrow and Hong Kong Airport have been paused since December 2021 amid the Covid-19 pandemic.  “We’re sorry for the disappointment caused to our loyal customers on this route and anyone booked to travel from March 2023, whose flights will be cancelled,” the company said, adding that customers  affected will be able to amend their flights with no change fee or will be able to request a refund.  “We sincerely apologise for any inconvenience caused to affected customers,” it said.

The poultry producer said Wednesday that it’s bringing together its corporate employees at its global headquarters in Arkansas, resulting in the closure of three offices, including downtown Chicago, Downers Grove, Illinois, and Dakota Dunes in South Dakota. Roughly 1,000 employees work in the three offices and will begin relocation in early next year. “Bringing our talented corporate team members and businesses together under one roof unlocks greater opportunities to share perspectives and ideas, while also enabling us to act quickly to solve problems and provide the innovative products solutions that our customers deserve and value,” said CEO Donnie King in a release. Tyson’s move serves another blow for Chicago’s image. McDonald’s, which has its headquarters there, criticized the city for crime. CEO Chris Kempczinski recently said that crime is “seeping into every corner of our city” and he said that he’s frequently asked “what’s going on in Chicago?” “We have violent crime that’s happening in our restaurants … we’re seeing homelessness issues in our restaurants. We’re having drug overdoses that are happening in our restaurants,” he said last month at the Economic Club of Chicago. “So we see in our restaurants, every single day, what’s happening in society at large.” He said it’s difficult to recruit people to work at the company’s headquarters, noting: “One of the things that I hear from our employees [is] … ‘I’m not sure it’s safe to come downtown.’” McDonald’s said it’s staying in Chicago, but other companies that are leaving the city have been less forthcoming about their reasons. In an email to CNN, Tyson said the move out of Chicago was not related to crime. Boeing\n            \n                (BA) said in May it was leaving Chicago for Washington, DC, The company didn’t blame crime. Analysts said the change signaled it has lost the commercial race to Airbus and wants to be seen as primarily a defense and space contractor. Boeing\n            \n                (BA) used to be based in Seattle from its founding in 1916 to 2001. Caterpillar and Citadel also recently announced moves out of Chicago to different locations outside Illinois. Caterpillar was based in Deerfield, a suburb of the city. However, Kellogg said in June that its newly formed cereal and plant-based food companies will be headquartered in Chicago. Tyson has had a rocky year because of inflation. It recently said that “demand for chicken is extremely strong,” while demand for its higher-priced cuts of beef has softened. Average sales price for chicken grew during its latest quarter, while the average price for beef and pork fell as consumers balked at some premium cuts.  Consumer demand for meat remained strong, Tyson said, but consumers are shifting between meats because of inflation. The company plans to launch new lower-priced options and also add new larger package sizes for consumers searching for value. Shares of Tyson are down about 25% for the year. Update: This story has been updated to clarify Caterpillar’s headquarters was in a Chicago suburb. – CNN Business’ Nathaniel Meyersohn contributed to this report.</Text></Article><Article paper="cnn" author="[{&quot;@type&quot;:&quot;Person&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Peter Valdes-Dapena&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.cnn.com/profiles/peter-valdes-dapena&quot;}]"><Text>Last June, Toyota warned owners of its first mainstream electric vehicle, the BZ4X, to stop driving their SUVs and have them transported to dealers because of a scary problem: the wheels could fall off after driving even just a few miles.

However, successive UK foreign secretaries, first Dominic Raab and then Liz Truss, before she became prime minister, have refused to take a view as to whether Kanu was a victim of extraordinary rendition.The family has been granted a judicial review to challenge that refusal, arguing that its effect has been that no action has been taken to help him.His brother, Kingsley Kanu, said: “The British government is well known for its stance on human rights. I believe it must be decisive when it comes to its decision-making about very serious violations of the human rights of British citizens abroad, especially when the facts are clear, as they are in my brother’s case, and when the UN has investigated and reached a firm conclusion that my brother was subject to extraordinary rendition. I am very happy that the court has agreed that a hearing is necessary to decide this important issue.”Kanu’s family claim he was tortured in Kenya and has been held in solitary confinement in Abuja since being transported there. The UN working group referred the case to the special rapporteur on torture. It expressed concern that he had been denied treatment and medication for his heart condition and highlighted that solitary confinement in excess of 15 consecutive days is prohibited under the Nelson Mandela rules, international non-binding standards.In a court filing concerning a parallel case brought by Nnamdi Kanu in Abuja, the Nigerian government denied torturing or mistreating him. It claimed that he entered Kenya unlawfully, having previously jumped bail in Nigeria, and so had no right to an extradition hearing.In 2015, Kanu was arrested in Nigeria and charged with terrorism offences and incitement, after setting up a digital radio station, Radio Biafra, at his home in London. Two years later he fled the country while on bail after an attack on his family home, which he claimed killed 28 members of Ipob. In January, he pleaded not guilty to terrorism charges.Shirin Marker, from Bindmans LLP, who is representing Kingsley Kanu, said it was essential for the new foreign secretary, James Cleverly, to reach a firm conclusion on whether her client’s brother had been the victim of extraordinary rendition in order to decide what steps to take to assist him.“The evidence available to date establishes that he has been subject to extraordinary rendition and torture or inhumane treatment,” she said. “It is unacceptable for the UK government to continue to prevaricate on this issue. We are glad that the court has now granted permission for this case to move to a final hearing.”Explaining her decision to grant a judicial review hearing, Mrs Justice Ellenbogen said: “Such decisions/inaction are, in principle, reviewable and do not enter forbidden areas, including decisions affecting foreign policy.”The Foreign Office declined to comment while proceedings were active.</Text></Article><Article paper="guardian" author="[{'name': 'Fiona Harvey Environment correspondent'}]"><Text>The Egyptian hosts of the next UN climate summit have issued a plea for countries to set aside tensions and animosity over the Ukraine war for the sake of focusing on the climate crisis.Egypt will host the Cop27 conference in Sharm El-Sheikh in November, intended as a forum for companies to fulfil the promises they made at the landmark Cop26 summit in Glasgow last year.However, expectations for the meeting have dimmed, as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has set nations at loggerheads, while the rocketing energy prices and food prices that have resulted have wrought economic and political damage across the developed and developing world.Climate journalism, open to allA diplomatic freeze between the US and China – the world’s two biggest emitters of greenhouse gases – over Taiwan has also cast a pall over the talks.Wael Aboulmagd, the Egyptian government’s special representative for Cop27, called on nations to concentrate on the pressing nature of the climate crisis and to carry on negotiations despite their differences on other geopolitical issues.“Animosity will have a cost. We as responsible diplomats ask everyone to rise to the occasion and show leadership,” he said during a call with journalists on Wednesday. “Put political differences aside and come together.”Climate negotiations are supposed to carry on in their own diplomatic stream, regardless of external events, and the three decades of talks under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change have weathered wars and regional conflicts before. In June, at a preparatory UN climate meeting in Bonn, some countries staged a walkout when Russia took to the conference floor but returned to negotiations later.Aboulmagd said countries must not use the upheavals in geopolitics and in national economies since Cop26 to hide their inaction. “Show more ambition,” he said. “I urge everyone not to use this unfolding geopolitical situation as a pretext for backsliding.”Rather, rising fossil fuel prices should concentrate minds on finding alternatives, he said. “I hope and urge everyone to take the right lesson from this: that overdependence on fossil fuels is problematic, and we need to expedite the transition to renewable energy.”He pointed out that no country would escape damage from the climate crisis, and that all countries agreed at Glasgow on the vital importance of working together to bring down greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the impacts of extreme weather. “Set aside the adversarial zero sum approach. With this most existential threat, we need to act to save lives and livelihoods. There is no time for delays, no pretext for not acting or backtracking.”Aboulmagd, who was Egypt’s ambassador to Brazil and is now assisting Sameh Shoukry, the foreign minister who will act as president of Cop27, also promised that civil society would be represented at the talks.Sign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

We are involving civil society stakeholders across the board and every step of the way,” he said.He said the Egyptian government had moved to recognise an increasing number of groups active in climate campaigning and would devote several days of the fortnight-long conference to issues such as youth engagement, under-represented groups, climate finance and related issues such as water and nature.However, many campaigners have told the Guardian of difficulties obtaining visas and passes to the conference, and prohibitively high prices for accommodation. They are also worried about their ability to protest, and whether groups and individuals they work with in Egypt may face reprisals after the summit.</Text></Article><Article paper="guardian" author="[{'name': 'Dan Sabbagh Defence and security editor'}]"><Text>It would be cynical to see Saudi Arabia’s efforts to secure the release of international prisoners held by Russian proxies in Ukraine as an attempt to improve the country’s image after the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, its foreign minister has said.Prince Faisal bin Farhan al Saud said on Friday that Riyadh had first approached the UK government in April, shortly after Aiden Aslin, a British citizen, and others were captured at Mariupol, and had acted for compassionate reasons, hoping to negotiate their release.Asked if it was a rare opportunity to repair relations with the west, the minister said: “I think that’s a very cynical view. What we saw, what the kingdom’s leadership saw, was an opportunity to achieve a humanitarian breakthrough to facilitate the return of these detainees to their families. And that’s the motivation.”Saudi Arabia, which has sought to take a softer stance on Russia following the outbreak of the war, has previously said Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was involved in a major diplomatic effort, which also appeared to have involved the former Chelsea football club owner and billionaire Roman Abramovich.One of the five Britons released, Shaun Pinner, recognised Abramovich on the plane flying them out from Russia to Riyadh earlier this week and approached him to ask if he was the former football club owner, according to a report in the Sun.Another of those released, John Harding, recounted the exchange that followed between the two men. “He went over to him on the plane and asked where he was from and Roman said ‘London’.“Then Shaun said, ‘You really look like Roman Abramovich’ and he replied, ‘That’s because I am him, sir’. He couldn’t believe it.”Five Britons were among 10 people facing the death penalty from pro-Russia separatists who were released unexpectedly earlier this week. They had all been accused of fighting as mercenaries on behalf of Ukraine, and had been put on trial in breach of the Geneva conventions covering prisoners of war.Aiden Aslin, 28, returned to his family home near Newark on Thursday, as did the other Britons, including Pinner, with whom he was put on trial in June. Aslin, Pinner and the Moroccan Brahim Saadoun, also released this week, had been sentenced to death in a ruling condemned internationally.Abramovich has not confirmed the reports but the billionaire, who was forced to sell Chelsea after Russia invaded Ukraine, had appeared at unsuccessful peace talks between the two sides in Istanbul in March. He is not on the US sanctions list, partly because Ukraine has told Washington he acts as a mediator.Prince Faisal said the mediation was “an initiative” led by Bin Salman dating back to April. “We learned about the issue of these foreign detainees and he engaged with the UK and others and of course, with Russia and Ukraine, to work towards the end of getting them out,” the foreign minister added.The Saudi minister said the deal to exchange the 10 foreign nationals was linked to a separate, larger deal to exchange prisoners between Ukraine and Russia. “That exchange only happened when the 10 nationals arrived in Saudi territory and were verified and that allowed the other exchange to go ahead,” Prince Faisal said.That implied Ukraine had wanted Russia to show good faith before it released the pro-Russian oligarch Viktor Medvedchuk and 55 other prisoners, in return for 200 soldiers and five commanders of the Azov battalion who led the defence of Mariupol. That deal also involved mediation from Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. This story was amended on Friday 23 September 2022 to correct the name of the Saudi foreign minister. </Text></Article><Article paper="guardian" author="[{'name': 'Lizzy Davies'}]"><Text>Doctors at the biggest hospital in Tigray say they have just days supply left of insulin, as the resumption of fighting between rebels and Ethiopian government troops once again cuts off supplies to the region.In what the head of the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) has branded “a humanitarian crime,” medics at Ayder specialist referral hospital warn they have already run out of one kind of the life-saving medicine and have only a week’s supply of another.Earlier this year, a cessation of hostilities in the bitter conflict between the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) and federal troops allowed for the delivery of emergency supplies into the northern region, which until then had been languishing under what the United Nations termed a de-facto blockade.Now, with fighting once again raging and both sides blaming the other for breaking the truce, humanitarian officials say they have been unable to get fresh supplies of either food or medicines into Tigray for a month. The region remains largely cut off from the rest of Ethiopia, without basic services such as electricity, communications and banking.“What we had at the hospital we were distributing to the patients, but especially this week, patients are coming and we tell them we don’t have insulin medications,” said a senior doctor, who did not want to be named for security reasons. “They are coming from very far places. Transport is not easy … So when they reach here and we tell them there is no insulin, they are heartbroken. They cry.”The doctor said he was scared that Ayder hospital would see a repeat of last year, when supplies into Tigray were stopped for months. “We will see patients dying and falling in the street,” he said.Andrew Boulton, president of the IDF and professor of medicine at the University of Manchester, called on Abiy Ahmed’s government to take urgent action so that insulin and other essential supplies could get to Tigray.“This is really a sort of humanitarian crime,” he said. “Even at times of war, there are agreements that essential medications should get through to the population. And this appears not to be occurring at the moment, in the best evidence that I have.”‘I saw an oncologist cry’: Tigray cancer patients sent home to die for lack of drugsRead moreA second doctor at Ayder hospital said doctors in Tigray generally used two types of insulin: fast-acting, or regular, insulin and an intermediate-acting insulin known as NPH.“What we have is a very [small] amount of the regular; we reserved that to manage acute complications of diabetes,” the doctor said. “Otherwise, the main insulin preparation for the patient is the intermediate-acting, which mimics physiologic insulin. We don’t have that one. It’s almost more than a month since we have finished the insulin.”People with type 1 diabetes require daily insulin to control their blood glucose levels. Without this, their condition can rapidly prove fatal.Boulton has written to the Ethiopian health minister, Lia Tadesse Gebremedhin, urging her to end the “ongoing regulatory and security obstacles” that are “endangering the lives of the many thousands of people living with chronic and non-communicable conditions, including diabetes”.More than 6,000 people were being treated for type 1 diabetes throughout the region before the war began, about 2,500 of them at Ayder.In the letter, seen by the Guardian, Boulton urges the government to “fully comply with international law and ensure the necessary humanitarian access” to support vulnerable populations in Tigray.‘Trying to survive’: millions in Tigray face hunger as they wait in vain for aidRead moreHe said the outlook for type 1 diabetes patients in Tigray was “terrible, as we used to see in the 19th century [before the discovery of insulin]”.“I’m not involved politically [in the conflict] on either side,” he told the Guardian. “But as president of IDF, especially at this time – it is 100 years, this year, since the first successful insulin injection was given in Toronto – our aim is that nobody, anywhere in the world, should die because they cannot get the treatments they need.”The government denies placing Tigray under blockade, blaming the TPLF for making aid delivery too dangerous. The UN’s World Food Programme (WFP), which has delivered all humanitarian cargo into the region on behalf of the World Health Organization, Médecins Sans Frontières and others, has also in the past accused the rebels of seizing its fuel, and for a long time refusing to return its aid trucks.The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) was able to start airlifting in some supplies of insulin and other medicines, with the support of the ministry of health, in January, after the IDF and others raised concerns about pharmaceutical stocks.On Thursday, a spokesperson for the ICRC said that all its flights and humanitarian convoys to Tigray had been suspended “until further notice” since the resumption of hostilities. WFP has not been able to lead a convoy into Tigray since 22 August.Fighting erupted between the TPLF and government forces in late August. The TPLF said federal troops and their allies had launched a big offensive towards southern Tigray. The government, however, accused the TPLF of striking first.</Text></Article><Article paper="guardian" author="[{'name': 'Harriet Sherwood'}]"><Text>The daughter of the late Anglican archbishop Desmond Tutu has been barred by the Church of England from officiating at her godfather’s funeral in a Shropshire church because she is married to a woman.Mpho Tutu van Furth, an ordained priest in the Anglican church, was invited to preside over the funeral of Martin Kenyon, who died last week at the age of 92. The C of E said its actions were “in line with the House of Bishops current guidance on same-sex marriage”.Tutu van Furth’s wife, Marceline, a Dutch academic, accused the C of E of homophobia. She said the couple had visited Kenyon in April, and he asked Mpho to preside over his funeral.“That she can’t do something out of love for her godfather and for the family just because of the same-sex marriage … that’s something that upsets me,” she said, according to a report in Voice of America.Kenyon’s family were forced to relocate Thursday’s funeral service from St Michael and All Angels church, in Wentnor, near Bishops Castle, to a marquee in the grounds of the former vicarage next door in order to allow Tutu van Furth to preside in an unofficial capacity.“The family are devastated at the church’s decision,” a family friend said. “Even in a conservative rural hinterland like Shropshire, people are appalled at what has happened. It’s unchristian and unjust.”In a statement, the Diocese of Hereford said: “We acknowledge this is a difficult situation.”The C of E permits clergy to be in same-sex relationships as long as they are celibate. The church does not conduct or bless same-sex marriages. The issue has been the cause of deep divisions within the C of E and the global Anglican church for decades.Kenyon, a former Welsh Fusilier and Old Etonian, had a brief moment of fame after complaining that he “couldn’t damn well find anywhere to park my car” when he was one of the first people to receive a Covid vaccination in December 2020.The next day on live television, he asked Piers Morgan, then presenter of ITV’s Good Morning Britain: “Who are you?”Kenyon had been friends with Desmond Tutu for decades. Both men were godfathers to each other’s daughters.Tutu, the former archbishop of Cape Town who won the Nobel peace prize in 1984, died last December. He gave a “father’s blessing” to his daughter’s same-sex marriage, but was barred by the South African church from officiating.Tutu championed LGBTQ+ rights, saying in 2013: “I would refuse to go to a homophobic heaven … I would not worship a God who is homophobic and that is how deeply I feel about this.”He added: “I am as passionate about this campaign as I ever was about apartheid.”Tutu van Furth was forced to give up working as a priest in South Africa in 2016 because the Anglican church there does not permit its clergy to be in same-sex marriages, although they have been legal in the country since 2006.

An earlier version was mistakenly accompanied by a picture of the Rev Nontombi Naomi Tutu, Mpho Tutu van Furth’s sister.</Text></Article><Article paper="guardian" author="[{'name': 'Lizzy Davies'}]"><Text>More than 3.5 million children are at risk of dropping out of school due to the drought in the Horn of Africa, the United Nations has said, amid warnings the crisis could lead to “a lost generation” that misses out on education.According to new figures shared with the Guardian, Unicef now estimates that 3.6 million children in Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia are in danger of leaving school as a result of the cumulative pressure on households caused by the unrelenting drought.In a sign of how acute the situation is becoming in many areas, that number has more than tripled – from 1.1 million – in the past six months.Four consecutive failed rainy seasons have pushed millions of families to the brink, increasing the number of deaths of children from malnutrition and forcing people to flee their homes in search of more resources.But the drought also threatens to cause another, quieter ripple effect in the three worst-hit countries, said Abhiyan Jung Rana, Unicef’s education adviser for eastern and southern Africa.“In the Horn of Africa, there are about 15 million children out of school, including these countries. But the fear is that because of the drought an additional 3.6 million more children will drop out as they’re moving with their parents to different areas away from their school.”Teachers and activists in Somaliland, an autonomous region of Somalia, say they are already seeing this effect in their classrooms – and it is mainly girls who are leaving.“When the chips are down, it is always the girls who bear the brunt of the situation,” said Sadia Allin, country director for Plan International, which is working with communities in Somaliland to help them withstand the drought.Ethiopian drought leading to ‘dramatic’ increase in child marriage, Unicef warnsRead more“It is very worrying. Education provides immediate physical, psychological, and cognitive protection. For girls, being out of school is disappointing. It is impacting their dreams,” she said.“When girls feel they are losing that [education], it seems also that they are losing their rights.”Kiin Farah Hasan, the headteacher of a village school in the Toghdeer region of Somaliland, is praying that this year will be better for the girls at her school. By the end of the last academic year, after two rainy seasons failed, only 31 of the original 56 girls remained.“Some of the girls got married, some of them moved to other places because their parents migrated from here due to the drought,” she said. “And some of them, their families are poor and have nothing, even getting their livelihoods is hard for them.”Kiin said she had become used to teaching hungry children. “When we wonder about them being hungry, sometimes we give them a 30-minute break and order food from the market for them to eat, and for some I even cook food in my house and give [it to] them,” she said.Kiin Farah Hasan, a teacher in Toghdeer, Somaliland, says she is used to teaching hungry pupils and often prepares food for them herself. Photograph: Armstrong Kiprotich/Plan InternationalA proper school feeding programme, along with a school bus to cover the 3-6 mile (5-10km) journey to school, would enable many of those at risk to stay in education, she said. But the absence of these, combined with the added pressure on household incomes, has stacked the odds against children getting to school.Kiin said she believed “three or four” of the girls who dropped out had married since leaving school. “Maybe some of them got married by their own will, but that problem really affected me.”Child marriages often increase in times of drought or disaster as parents seek to raise extra funds through dowries.Unicef said it did not expect to see a discernible difference between the sexes in terms of the numbers of children at risk of dropping out, because the displacement of entire families, including boys and girls, was a major factor in their vulnerability.But Jung Rana said he did expect girls to be less likely to return to school, just as in the aftermath of Covid lockdowns, which in some places coincided with higher rates of early marriage, teenage pregnancy, and gender-based violence.Famine: what is it, where will it strike and how should the world respond?Read more“I would foresee something similar happening because, in a sense, schools are closed for them and they’re there with their parents or with their families, and these kinds of things would likely be happening more,” he said.He added: “Girls especially are looked on in households to be able to provide the caregiving aspects … more than boys would be, in terms of taking care of their smaller siblings and taking care of chores around the home or wherever they are. I think, with those conditions, they are more likely not to go back.”Women collect water in Xidhinta in Somaliland. An estimated 13 million people are facing severe hunger in the Horn of Africa as a result of drought, the UN says. Photograph: Daniel Jukes/APSpeaking from Hargeisa, the capital of Somaliland, Allin said it was vital that donor countries such as the UK recognised that droughts and other crises could have severe repercussions on girls’ education, and provide funding accordingly. Liz Truss, Britain’s new prime minister, has in the past declared women and girls to be a priority.“My message to her and to the world is that education is just such a powerful thing … and if we don’t provide these girls with the resources that they need to stay in education, it will [mean the] loss of a generation and [be] very costly in the future,” she added.Unicef estimates that 1.57 million children – roughly equal numbers of girls and boys – are at risk of dropping out of school in Kenya, 1.14 million in Ethiopia and 900,000 in Somalia, including Somaliland.It says factors that increase the chances of a child dropping out include the displacement of the family to other villages with limited educational capacity, a lack of school feeding programmes, and parents’ inability to afford essentials such as books and uniforms.</Text></Article><Article paper="guardian" author="[{'name': 'Gloria Oladipo in New York'}]"><Text>Twenty people were missing after a boat carrying Cuban migrants sank off Florida due to Hurricane Ian, further underlining the human cost of the storm.Hurricane Ian: more than 2m without power as Florida hit with ‘catastrophic’ wind and rainRead moreUS border patrol said it responded to a migrant landing in Stock Island, in the lower Florida Keys, Reuters said.Four migrants swam to shore after their vessel sank, hours before the hurricane made landfall in Florida.Three more people were rescued in the water and taken to hospital with heat exhaustion and dehydration symptoms, the US coast guard said.A search and rescue effort led by the coast guard was under way.On Tuesday, seven people also from Cuba were taken into custody after making it to shore in Pompano Beach, Florida, just north of Fort Lauderdale, CBS News said.Officials used social media to issue a warning about making the dangerous journey by sea, even after Hurricane Ian passes.“Do not risk your life by attempting this journey at sea. Storm surge along with King tide can create treacherous sea conditions even after a storm passes,” they said.Hurricane Ian battered Cuba, killing at least two people and leaving much of the island in total blackout. Millions were already facing daily power interruptions.After making landfall in Florida, one of the most intense storms to make landfall in the US has continued to wreak havoc on hospitals and other essential infrastructure.A hospital in Port Charlotte, Florida, an hour outside Venice, experienced major flooding in its lower-level emergency room and had the roof of its intensive care unit torn off, the Associated Press reported.Medical staff at HCA Florida Fawcett worked quickly on Wednesday to move its most vulnerable patients to other floors, as water flooded the hospital from above and below.The hospital has four floors. Only two remained usable.Dr Birgit Bodine, who was there when the roof came off, said patients had been mostly understanding amid damage from the storm but staff were worried about the potential influx of patients with storm-related injuries.“The ambulances may be coming soon and we don’t know where to put them in the hospital at this point,” Bodine said, noting that patients were “doubled or tripled up” given the lack of space.Bodine added: “For us, as much as everything is terrible and we’re exhausted … as long as our patients do OK and nobody ends up dying or having a bad outcome, that’s what matters.’</Text></Article><Article paper="guardian" author="[{'name': 'Richard Luscombe in Miami'}]"><Text>Hurricane Ian, one of the most powerful storms ever to strike the US mainland, has battered south-west Florida with high winds, rain and storm surges as it weakened and moved inland.More than 2m homes and businesses were left without power as the storm swept ashore in south-west Florida on Wednesday afternoon, bringing “catastrophic” 150mph (240km/h) winds and a deadly storm surge of up to 18ft. Hours later, the storm – estimated to be about 140 miles (225km) wide – was downgraded from a category 4 to a category 1 storm as it moved slowly north-east, causing major flooding.The true scale of the damage remained unclear as darkness fell, with power and communications networks down, and emergency services workers forced to take shelter from the worst of the storm.Residential areas in Fort Myers Beach and several other coastal cities were almost completely submerged, buildings were damaged, and trees and power lines brought down. The utility company Florida Power and Light warned those in Ian’s path to brace for days without power.MapIn coastal Florida, desperate people posted to Facebook and other social sites, pleading for rescue for themselves or loved ones. A local sheriff’s office reported that it was getting many calls from people trapped in flooded homes.A flooded street in downtown Fort Myers, Florida.

So we just ask people for their thoughts and their prayers. This is a major, major storm.”map of Hurricane Ian’s pathThe storm surge flooded the lower-level emergency room of the HCA Florida Fawcett hospital in Port Charlotte, while fierce winds tore part of the fourth-floor roof from its intensive care unit, according to Dr Birgit Bodine, who works there.Intensive care staff were forced to evacuate the hospital’s sickest patients – some of them on ventilators – to other floors. The medium-sized hospital spans four floors, but patients were forced into just two because of the damage.Bodine said incoming storm injuries could make things worse. “The ambulances may be coming soon and we don’t know where to put them in the hospital at this point,” she said. “Because we’re doubled and tripled up.”Ian had already been blamed for several deaths and unprecedented flooding in Cuba, which was beginning to restore electricity to regions on Wednesday after a total wipeout of power on the island.Meanwhile, a search for more than 20 people was under way off the coast of Florida after a boat carrying migrants from Cuba to the US mainland sank. Several passengers were rescued from the waters.Joe Biden promised the full support of federal resources for search and rescue missions, and then the recovery effort in Florida, which officials warned would be changed forever by the impact of the storm.“We’ll be there to help you recover, we’ll be there to help you clean up and rebuild, [and] to help get Florida moving,” the US president said in an address from the White House, adding that his federal emergency declaration means thousands of national guard troops had been activated and millions of liters of water, food and generators were on their way.Ian approached Florida after passing over Cuba and the Caribbean sea as a powerful tropical storm, and building strength in the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico.Torrential flooding and powerful winds were captured in dramatic video posted to social media that showed trees uprooted, lashing rain and submerged cars.

Authorities warned those who remained would be on their own because conditions were too dangerous for emergency crews to be out.“The response from emergency medical services, fire and police will be stopped,” said Kevin Anderson, the Fort Myers mayor.“So you know those who chose to stay put themselves in that risk.”News anchors at the Fort Myers television station Wink had to abandon their usual desk and continue storm coverage from another location in their newsroom because water was pushing into their building near the Caloosahatchee River.Some broadcasters drew criticism for covering the dangerous conditions in person; one meteorologist was seen being hit by a flying branch.Elsewhere, flamingos at St Petersburg’s famous Sunken Gardens rode out the storm in a bathroom.

The blackout, he added, was “an exceptional condition – a total of zero” electricity generation. The storm left at least two dead in western Cuba, state-run media reported.

Killings hit a record of 227 in 2020 despite the pandemic.“Wutty prompted us to confront a range of questions. What was the global picture, what were the implications of such attacks and what could be done to prevent them?” wrote Davis in the report.The killings have disproportionately affected lower-income countries and Indigenous communities; 39% of the victims were from this demographic, despite it making up only 5% of the world’s population.Mining and extractive industries, logging and agribusiness were the most common drivers for a murder when a cause was known. The report’s authors warned the figures were likely a significant underestimate and do not capture the full scale of the problem, with the deaths often occurring in ecosystems crucial to averting the worst impacts of the climate crisis.The 200 people killed in 2021 included eight park rangers in Virunga national park in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which is facing the added threat of oil and gas extraction, the environmental activist Joannah Stutchbury, who was shot outside her home in Kenya, and Ángel Miro Cartagena, who died in Colombia and was one of 50 small-scale farmers killed last year.In June this year, the journalist Dom Phillips, who wrote extensively for the Guardian and the Observer, and Bruno Pereira, a Brazilian expert on uncontacted tribes, were murdered in the Javari valley in Brazil’s Amazon after going missing. Phillips was working on a book about sustainable development called How to Save the Amazon and Pereira was helping him with interviews. The investigation into their murders continues.“It’s important to picture these victims as the real people they are. It’s easier for me. I have been surrounded by land and environmental defenders all my life, and indeed I am one of them,” wrote the Indian environmentalist Dr Vandana Shiva in the report foreword.“We are not just in a climate emergency. We are in the foothills of the sixth mass extinction, and these defenders are some of the few people standing in the way. They don’t just deserve protection for basic moral reasons. The future of our species, and our planet, depends on it,” she said.The report noted, however, that there have been some significant victories for environmental campaigners. In South Africa last year, Indigenous communities from the Wild Coast of South Africa’s Eastern Cape won a legal victory over Shell, forcing the company to halt oil exploration in whale-breeding grounds. The ruling was upheld earlier this month.In May this year, communities on Sangihe Island, Indonesia, won a lawsuit against a Canadian-backed company planning to mine gold on their island after having a previous challenge thrown out for technical reasons.“While the numbers of killings have remained high, one thing I took away from doing this research was that there have been some significant victories by environmental defenders over the last few years, including against huge multinationals,” said the report’s author Ali Hines, a campaigner at Global Witness.‘They attacked with machetes’: murder, mafias and illegal mining in Peru’s gold fieldsRead moreMore than two-thirds of the murders of people trying to protect forests, rivers and other ecosystems between 2012 and 2021 took place in Latin America, with 342 killed in Brazil and 322 in Colombia. In Mexico, 154 were killed, and 117 in Honduras. The Philippines was another country of concern, with 270 murders.“This is a global problem but it is almost exclusively happening in the global south,” said Hines. “Corruption and inequality are two kinds of key enabling factors for the killings. For example, in the land titling process, there can be investment deals between companies and corrupt officials. Defenders who try to seek justice are sometimes up against judges paid off with bribes. That leads on to the third factor, which is the high rates of impunity. Cases are very rarely credibly investigated, never mind perpetrators brought to justice.”The report urges governments to create a safe civil space for environmental defenders and promote legal accountability of companies, helping to ensure zero-tolerance for violence against activists.The Colombian and Filipino governments did not respond to a request for comment from the Guardian about the high rate of murders. The Brazilian government said environmental defenders and communicators, including journalists, were protected by a national programme, which could be joined voluntarily.Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features</Text></Article><Article paper="guardian" author="[{'name': 'Reuters in Bogotá'}]"><Text>At least 10 armed groups in Colombia, including the Gulf Clan crime gang and dissident members of the Farc rebels who rejected a peace deal have agreed to participate in unilateral ceasefires, according to the government.‘It’s total terror’: Colombian cartel retaliates over kingpin’s arrestRead morePresident Gustavo Petro, who took office in August, has promised to seek “total peace” with armed groups, fully implementing a 2016 peace accord with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) and meeting with dissidents and gangs.“Each group with its own identity, nature and motivation is expressing its disposition to be part of a total peace, in this exploration phase we’ve asked them not to kill, not to disappear people and not to torture,” Danilo Rueda, the government’s high peace commissioner, told journalists at an impromptu press conference. “We are moving ahead.”Among the groups are two Farc dissident groups – the Central General Staff and Second Marquetalia – as well as the Clan del Golfo, the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta Self-Defence and others Rueda did not name.Illegal armed groups in Colombia – whose six-decade conflict has killed at least 450,000 people – count about 6,000 fighters in their ranks, according to security sources.Leftist rebels and crime gangs both participate in extortion, murder, drug trafficking and illegal gold mining.Petro – himself a former member of the M-19 urban guerrillas – has said his government could offer reduced sentences to gang members who hand over ill-gotten assets and give information about drug trafficking.Colombian leader’s promise of ‘total peace’ may prove too ambitiousRead more“The office of peace is exploring the judicial mechanisms to permit the transition of armed groups to rule of law,” said Rueda, who previously met with Farc dissidents.

The powerful derecho, the worst to ever hit the region, killed two people, flattened dozens of homes, washed land into the ocean and left hundreds of thousands in Nova Scotia, southern Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island without power. As residents look to the daunting cleanup and rebuilding efforts, experts says the hundreds of millions in damage highlights the need to build defensively against the effects of climate change.“Unfortunately, the reality with climate change is that there’s going to be more extreme weather events. We’re going to have to think about how to make sure we’re ready for whatever comes at us,” prime minister Justin Trudeau told reporters as he witnessed the destruction in Nova Scotia. The federal government has dispatched nearly 600 Canadian Armed Forces soldiers to help with the cleanup and pledged immediate aid to residents.Larger urban centres such as Halifax were largely spared the worst of the storm, but houses across the region were reduced to rubble and debris, roads washed away, and thousands of trees knocked town by uncharacteristically strong winds, which gusted at 190km/h at their peak.By Wednesday, more than 160,000 people were still without power and heavy rain in some parts hampered cleanup efforts.“We’ve been hit by something bigger than we’ve ever been hit with before,” Dennis King, the premier of Prince Edward Island, told reporters. “We’re all feeling the effects of that. We’re all very fragile.”Damage caused by Hurricane Fiona in Fox Roost-Margaree, Newfoundland. Photograph: Susan Sweet-Skinner/AFP/Getty ImagesPrince Edward Island, famed for its agriculture, is bracing for significant destruction to potato, soybean and apple crops, which are among the main economic drivers of the province. Fishing boats and potato-storage buildings were also heavily damaged. A spokesperson from Parks Canada said the force of the storm left a “shocking” level of erosion in its wake. Much of the island is hemmed in with distinct red sands, which help keep the ocean at bay. In many areas, the dunes were swept into the ocean, and it will take years for nature to rebuild.While Trudeau lamented the destruction, he also praised the “tremendous stories of resilience” that have emerged.In the hard-hit Nova Scotia town of Glace Bay, Carol and Leo Yang, the owners of Jay’s Chicken and Ribs, handed out hundreds of free hot meals to residents, cooking under the light of donated flashlights with a propane stove.“We started out just trying to help neighbours. But as a restaurant owner, I knew there was something more we could do,” Carol told the Guardian.Hundreds of residents have lined up outside the Yangs’ two locations for their first hot meal in days. Customers, some of whom have no houses to return to, hugged her as she handed them the boxed-up food.“They tell me the meal has warmed their bodies and their hearts,” she said.She and her husband worked as pharmacists in China before immigrating to Nova Scotia 10 years ago. They bought the restaurant six years ago and run it with their young daughter.Yang says more than 1,000 meals have gone out to those in need and donations have come in – locally and from other provinces – to help her family keep cooking.The devastation is expected to costs hundreds of millions, according to early estimates from insurers, putting it on track to become the costliest storm in the region’s history. Because storm surges are not covered by insurance, many residents will likely have to bear the cost themselves.“This type of destruction actually gives us a golden opportunity to put things back in a better way,” said Glenn McGillivray, the managing director of the Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction. “And it’s critical because we’re going to see more of these in these intense storms future. Climate change is a direct reason for that. The east coast has to get better prepared.”He said all new infrastructure projects or rebuilds should go through a climate assessment. McGillivray also cautioned against rebuilding in areas where climate risk is highest, including coastal communities.“The storm did exactly what the forecasters said it would do. It went where they said it would go. And it was as powerful as they said it was going to be. The damage came from very high winds, very heavy rains and storm surges, especially in small, isolated communities,” he said.“And so we saw those Newfoundland saltbox buildings, sitting perched on the rocks that you see on postcards, they just can’t handle this kind of storm.”While Ottawa has increasingly highlighted and supported improvements to construction, McGillivray says more needs to be done for resilience within the federal building code.“We just have this propensity to kind of put things back the way they were. Everybody wants to get their life back to normal as soon as possible, which is understandable. But that’s not going to work in a changing climate.”</Text></Article><Article paper="guardian" author="[{'name': 'Associated Press in Bangkok'}]"><Text>A Myanmar fashion model who was denied entry to Thailand and feared arrest by the military government in Yangon if she was forced back home from exile has flown to Canada, which she says has granted her asylum.Thaw Nandar Aung, also known as Han Lay, left on a flight from Bangkok’s Suvarnabhumi airport early on Wednesday, according to Archayon Kraithong, a deputy commissioner of Thailand’s Immigration Bureau. He said he was not authorised to reveal her destination.Thaw Nandar Aung told the US-government-funded broadcaster Radio Free Asia on Tuesday that she was headed to Canada after being granted political asylum there with the assistance of the United Nations high commissioner for refugees (UNHCR) and the Canadian embassy in Thailand.“Everything happened so fast, and I only have a few pieces of clothing. So I will have to go along with what they have planned for me,” she said.Myanmar model who criticised junta stuck in limbo after being denied entry to ThailandRead more“I have spoken out for Myanmar wherever I go. I have talked to the media about my country while I was staying in Thailand. Since Canada is a safe place for me, I will have more opportunities to speak out on the issue. And as you know, there is a large Myanmar community in Canada, so I’m sure I’ll be able to carry on the struggle for Myanmar with their help.”Thaw Nandar Aung had been stuck at the Bangkok airport after Thai authorities denied her entry when she arrived on 21 September from a short trip to Vietnam. She had been living in Thailand but needed to leave and enter again in order to extend her stay.While at the airport she met UNHCR representatives in an effort to avoid being sent back to Myanmar. People denied entry to Thailand are usually deported to their last point of departure, but the UN agency advised her she would be arrested in Vietnam and then repatriated to Myanmar. A Thai foreign ministry spokesperson said she had been denied entry into Thailand “due to an issue with her travel document”.Thaw Nandar Aung denounced her country’s military rulers last year from the stage of the Miss Grand International beauty pageant held in Bangkok. She accused them of selfishness and abusing their power for using lethal force to crush peaceful protests, and appealed for international help for her country.Myanmar’s military seized power in February 2021 from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi and has cracked down heavily on widespread opposition to its rule. Critics, including actors and other celebrities, have been arrested on charges that carry penalties ranging from three years’ imprisonment to death.In July, authorities executed four activists who were accused of involvement with terrorist activities, and UN experts have described the country’s violence as a civil war.Thaw Nandar Aung said she was charged in absentia in September last year with sedition for speaking out against the military takeover at the pageant and online. The charge carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison.The New York-based organisation Human Rights Watch accused Myanmar’s military government of revoking or otherwise interfering with Thaw Nandar Aung’s passport, making her “the victim of a deliberate political act by the junta to make her stateless when she flew back from Vietnam to Thailand”. It said the tactic was used against other critics as well.“There is no doubt that what transpired was a trap to try to force Han Lay to return to Myanmar, where she would have faced immediate arrest, likely abuse in detention, and imprisonment,” Phil Robertson, the group’s deputy Asia director said in an emailed statement. “Fortunately, she got good advice to stay put at the airport, and wait for the kind of protection she needed. This was a victory for rights, and refugee protection.”</Text></Article><Article paper="guardian" author="[{'name': 'Justin McCurry in Tokyo and agencies'}]"><Text>The US vice-president, Kamala Harris, has condemned North Korea’s “provocative nuclear rhetoric” during a trip to South Korea that included a visit to the heavily armed border dividing the peninsula.Harris arrived in Seoul on Thursday, hours after North Korea fired two short-range ballistic missiles into the sea, in a move that underlines Washington’s struggle to rein in the regime’s weapons programme.Her visit to the demilitarised zone (DMZ) – which has divided the peninsula since the 1950-1953 Korean war ended in an uneasy truce – was intended to demonstrate the US’s commitment to South Korea, a key ally in the region.Harris looked through binoculars as a South Korean colonel pointed out military installations on the southern side. An American colonel then pointed out some of the defences along the military demarcation line, which marks the boundary between the two Koreas, including barbed wire fences and mines.“It’s so close,” Harris said.Earlier, she told US military personnel at a nearby base “how grateful and thankful we are” for their role in protecting the southern side of the tense border between the two Koreas.North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, has overseen a record number of missile launches this year, including one that involved a long-range weapon. Officials in Seoul and Washington have warned that Pyongyang could be preparing to carry out a nuclear test.In a meeting in Seoul with the South Korean president, Yoon Suk-yeol, Harris praised the alliance between the two countries as a “linchpin of security and prosperity. I’m here to reinforce the strength of our alliance and strengthen our work together”.Yoon, a conservative who took office in May, called her visit “another turning point” in strengthening bilateral ties.They reaffirmed their commitment to the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula and “condemned [North Korea’s] provocative nuclear rhetoric and ballistic missile launches, in violation of UN security council resolutions”, the White House said in a statement. “They discussed our response to potential future provocations, including through trilateral cooperation with Japan.”The DMZ has become a regular stop for visiting US officials eager to demonstrate their resolve on North Korean weapons’ development and their commitment to the security of South Korea, where 28,5000 US troops are based.The 155-mile (250km) long border is highly fortified with razor wire, heavy armaments and tank traps on either side of a 2.5-mile wide buffer.Ronald Reagan was the first US president to visit the DMZ, but Bill Clinton – who described it as “the scariest place on Earth” during a 1993 visit – and Donald Trump are the only sitting presidents to have visited the Joint Security Area, a cluster of buildings that hosts inter-Korean talks, and the only place where troops from both sides directly face each other.Harris’s visit comes at a time of rising tensions on the peninsula. This week, the US and South Korea launched large-scale naval exercises for the first time in five years. The allies insist that their joint drills are purely defensive, but North Korea routinely condemns them as rehearsals for an invasion.Earlier this week, Harris condemned Pyongyang’s “illicit weapons programme” during a speech at a naval base in Japan, where she also attended the state funeral of the country’s former prime minister Shinzo Abe.Speculation is building that North Korea is preparing to detonate a nuclear device in what would be its seventh nuclear test since 2006. Pyongyang claimed that its most recent test, in 2017, involved its most powerful weapon to date.This week, the South Korean spy agency said North Korea appeared to have completed a third tunnel at its Punggye-ri nuclear site as part of preparations for a test, according to a South Korean MP who attended a closed-door briefing by the National Intelligence Service.The lawmaker said Pyongyang was likely to conduct the test after the end of the Chinese Communist party congress, which begins on 16 October, and before US midterm elections on 8 November.Kim Jong-dae, of the Yonsei Institute for North Korean Studies, said the latest missile launches were an attempt by the regime “to gain an upper hand on the peninsula with a nuclear arsenal at its disposal”.That and other launches were “a harbinger of Pyongyang’s aggressive posturing to come next month – with missile launches and a possible nuclear test”, Kim added.</Text></Article><Article paper="guardian" author="[{'name': 'Helen Davidson in Taipei'}]"><Text>A Hong Kong court has sentenced pro-democracy figure in exile Ted Hui to three-and-a-half years in jail over charges related to the 2019 protest movement.The ruling in Hong Kong’s high court on Thursday, reported by local media, is the first time someone has been sentenced in absentia over the protests.Hui, a former legislator who fled to Australia via Europe in early 2021, was sentenced for contempt of court in cases related to his involvement in the protests, and alleged misconduct in the chamber of the legislature. In June he was convicted in absentia of breaching his bail conditions after prosecutors successfully argued he had abandoned the right to defend himself.Help Hong Kong residents flee before it’s too late, fugitive democracy figure urgesRead moreIn a statement on Wednesday evening, Hui dared the judge, Andrew Chan, to deliver a sentence “the heavier the better”.“Since I am in a free country, no matter how severely Judge Chan sentences me – 10 years or eight years in prison – it won’t harm my personal freedom or reputation, nor my international lobbying work,” he said.“The only objective effect of the heavy code is to exacerbate the degeneration of the rule of law in Hong Kong, and let the world see how the Hong Kong courts are willing to cooperate with tyranny and persecute citizens who are fighting for democracy and freedom.”Hui still faces multiple charges, including over a protest in July 2019, but has previously told the Guardian the charges were unfair and often based on fake testimony. He said the charges relating to contempt of the legislature for two incidents involving scuffles between politicians, and protests against pro-Beijing legislators, were “ridiculous”.He has also been accused of “foreign collusion” under the national security law, over social media posts seeking international support for Hong Kong.Hui is among a number of pro-democracy figures who have fled overseas as the government crackdown targets dissidents, politicians, journalists and protesters. Thousands have been charged over the protests, while hundreds of others detained or prosecuted under the national security law. Introduced in 2020, the law has been widely criticised for its broad definitions in outlawing acts as crimes of sedition, secession, foreign collusion and terrorism.</Text></Article><Article paper="guardian" author="[{'name': 'Tess McClure in Auckland'}]"><Text>New Zealand will ban live animal exports from next April, two years after storms sank a livestock ship, killing 41 crew members and 6,000 cattle.The death of two New Zealanders among the crew of the Gulf Livestock 1, which sank in a September 2020 typhoon, helped galvanise the movement to ban exports of live sheep and cattle.The animal welfare amendment bill was signed into law on Thursday, with the government saying it would protect New Zealand’s reputation as consumers become more ethically conscious. “It protects the reputation of not just our farmers now, but the farmers of the future,” the agriculture minister, Damien O’Connor, said.Live exports have long been controversial in Australia and New Zealand, and subject to long-term campaigns by animal rights groups. When they go wrong, they often result in thousands of animals drowning.Earlier this year, more than 15,000 sheep drowned after a live export ship sank in Sudan, and in 2020 a capsize killed 14,000 sheep. In 2021, 3,000 cattle were stranded at sea for three months, leaving many dead, dying, starving or extremely dehydrated.Because New Zealand is so remote, even a best-case-scenario journey is often arduous for animals.Live animal exports are being used as cover by smugglers, say NGOsRead more“New Zealand’s remoteness means animals are at sea for extended periods, heightening their susceptibility to heat stress and other welfare-associated risks,” O’Connor said.“Despite any regulatory measures we could put in place, the voyage times and the journey through the tropics to the northern hemisphere markets will always impose challenges.”All of the country’s exports of livestock by sea will stop on 30 April 2023. New Zealand exported 134,722 cattle last year, and live exports represented about 0.6% of primary sector exports. New Zealand only exports animals for breeding, not slaughter.The move has been welcomed by the Green party and animal rights activists. “This could not have come soon enough,” said the Greens animal welfare spokesperson, Chlöe Swarbrick. “Animals have been suffering in live export for years.”The opposition National party opposed the bill, saying it was a “disproportionate” and “ideological” response to the “the tragic sinking of the stock ship Gulf Livestock 1”.They argue that the move to end live exports could reduce gross domestic product by up to $472m.In 2020, Britain announced plans to ban the export of live animals for slaughter and fattening from England and Wales, but that plan has not yet been brought into force.In Australia, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, recently reaffirmed his government’s commitment to ending the trade, but said it would not be phased out before 2025.</Text></Article><Article paper="guardian" author="[{'name': 'Rebecca Kuku in Port Moresby'}]"><Text>An estimated 90,000 people have been displaced by violence in the highlands of Papua New Guinea since May, with about 25,000 children unable to attend school and reports of rape, kidnapping and other violence, say the UN and local officials.The fighting has been related in many cases to the recent national elections, in which around 50 people were killed and schools and other public buildings burnt down.“While in some cases, there are residual disputes over election results that are triggering sporadic violence, in other cases, such as in Porgera, the root causes are due to other reasons, and the instability of the election period was capitalised upon to reignite old disputes,” said Themba Kalua, UN resident coordinator and UN women country representative.Dozens killed and thousands displaced in election fighting in Papua New Guinea, UN saysRead moreKalua said that the UN estimates about 265,000 people had been affected by the 2022 general election-related violence in Enga, Southern Highlands and Hela (Highlands Region), leaving almost 90,000 people displaced.“The displaced persons are primarily women, children, people with disabilities, and the elderly who have been displaced from their communities while non-disabled men remain and fight. The challenge in getting a precise count remains as displaced persons frequently move about due to ongoing security concerns or in search of resources.“Women and children are the most affected. An estimated number of 25,000 learners are unable to attend school as schools in the affected areas remain closed. At least 70 women and girls now have been victimised by rape, kidnapping, or sorcery accusation-related violence.”Porgera crisis management coordinator, Nick Pakea, who is also the president of the Porgera Chamber of Commerce, said more than 60,000 people from Porgera Paiela in Enga have been severely affected by election-related violence and tribal fights.Papua New Guinea election violence: what has caused it and what can be done?Read morePakea said the troubles began when the Porgera mine was closed down, and worsened during the election when security forces were sent in to extract the 2022 general election ballot boxes.“More than 20 clans … clashed. Sixty thousand people were displaced, with many families fleeing to Mt Hagen in Western Highlands for refuge,” he said.“Those who do not have the means to seek refuge elsewhere are here. Our women and girls are left very vulnerable to sexual assaults and attacks. Our children are not attending schools.”“We have not received any support from the district, provincial or national government or from the US and UN as reported. Maybe help is still on its way, but on the ground, we have yet to see that help,” he said.The US government, through its international development agency USAID, provided $3.1m to support displaced persons and survivors of violence in the affected areas. This was in addition to the $100,000 donated in July for immediate humanitarian assistance.The United Nation’s Population Fund have also been supporting women and children affected by the violence in the highlands and distributing reproductive health kits, but it says challenges in reaching communities have been immense.“Schools and health facilities were also badly affected by the election-related violence. Rural health centres are severely understaffed and facing shortage of basic medicines. But the roadblocks [that have] been set up have remained one of the main challenges affecting our ability to reach the most vulnerable in the communities.”Meanwhile, police in PNG have also set up a taskforce investigating team with 40 investigators to look in election-related violence.</Text></Article><Article paper="guardian" author="[{'name': 'Helen Davidson in Taipei'}]"><Text>A popular Chinese film depicting a love story amid the hardships of life in rural China has been removed from all streaming services just weeks after its release, and discussion of it censored on social media.Return to Dust had been widely praised by audiences for its realistic and moving depiction of rural life in China. For the same reason it had also drawn criticism from nationalistic voices accusing it of portraying China in a negative light.The sudden disappearance of the film, which premiered at the Berlin international film festival, prompted widespread accusations the film was censored amid heightened sensitivity in China ahead of its most important political meeting, the party congress.China’s Lipstick King reappears, months after Tiananmen ‘tank cake’ rowRead moreThe couple at the centre of the film – played by film star Hai Qin and a local farmer and untrained actor Wu Renlin – fall in love after coming together in an arranged marriage. They navigate hardships relating to health, housing, and poverty, while living in a rural village being targeted for development.However, the party congress is in less than a month, and authorities are under pressure from the central government to ensure an atmosphere of national positivity and stability.After a delayed release in national cinemas, the arthouse film became a hit, topping box office takings in its ninth weekend. But then in mid September it reportedly began screening with an amended ending, in line with edits of other films at odds with Communist party ideology, before being dropped entirely from cinema listings.It remained available on multiple streaming sites until this week.On Tuesday a social media hashtag related to the film’s removal from streaming services had been viewed about 300,000 times, but only a handful of comments remained visible. The hashtag was later censored, with a Weibo error message saying it was unsearchable “due to relevant laws, regulations, and policies”.Among visible comments a few people supported its removal, with one viewer fearing the negative portrayal could be used by the west “to smear China”, but the majority was critical, with one asking “has Chinese art become a complete tool of the ruling class?”“Does it have to be a happy, thriving family scene to be real?” asked on Weibo user.“Hide the suffering, the suffering will not exist,” said another.The Guardian contacted the Chinese streaming platforms but they declined to comment. China’s often highly sensitive censorship of entertainment is largely opaque in its operations, and it is often unclear if a removal has been ordered by authorities or is a pre-emptive decision made by companies.In February platforms restored the original ending to the 1999 US film Fight Club after a viewer backlash to a hastily added final message that said police had “rapidly figured out the whole plan and arrested all criminals”.</Text></Article><Article paper="guardian" author="[{'name': 'Justin McCurry in Tokyo'}]"><Text>The US vice-president, Kamala Harris, is to visit the heavily armed border separating North and South Korea on Thursday, amid rising tensions on the peninsula.Harris will arrive at the demilitarised zone (DMZ) on the southern side of the border, days after the regime in Pyongyang warned that South Korea and the US risked “triggering a conflict” following the launch of large-scale naval exercises for the first time in five years.Harris’s visit to the DMZ will “underscore … the United States’ commitment to stand beside [South Korea] in the face of any threats” posed by North Korea, a White House official said.North Korea rejects Seoul’s ‘absurd’ offer of economic aid for denuclearisationRead moreHarris will be the most senior member of the US administration to go to the inter-Korean border since Donald Trump walked across the demarcation line into North Korea during a meeting with the country’s leader, Kim Jong-un, in 2019.She will “reflect on the shared sacrifice” of tens of thousands of US and Korean soldiers killed in the 1950-53 Korean war, which ended with a ceasefire but not a peace treaty, and “tour sites at the DMZ, meet with service members and receive an operational briefing from US commanders”, the official added.North Korea has conducted a record-breaking number of weapons tests this year, including one involving an intercontinental ballistic missile that was fired at full range for the first time since 2017.US and South Korean officials have warned for months that Pyongyang could be about to conduct what would be its seventh nuclear test, while some analysts have said the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, may wait until after the Chinese Communist party national congress, which begins on 16 October.North Korea has traditionally avoided doing anything to embarrass China, its biggest ally and trading partner.Officials in Washington and Seoul have promised a “swift and forceful” response to any nuclear test.The North indicated that it is determined to develop more sophisticated weapons with the test launch of a short-range ballistic missile on Sunday.The launch came the day before the US and South Korea – where 28,500 American troops are based – began joint drills involving the aircraft carrier the USS Ronald Reagan and its battle group off the Korean peninsula’s east coast.Harris, who attended the state funeral for Shinzo Abe in Tokyo on Tuesday, was due to address US sailors in Yokosuka, south of Tokyo, on Wednesday before flying to South Korea.She was expected to repeat Washington’s commitment to Japan’s security, and to warn China against aggressive moves towards Taiwan, days after the US president, Joe Biden, said the US would defend the island if China attempted to invade.“She will get into threats to the international rules-based order and how she sees them,” including recent provocations across the Taiwan strait, a senior administration official said.“She will speak about that and what we are doing to push back against those efforts and stand up for the international rules and norms that have guided this region.”Harris’s DMZ visit will be the first by a high-ranking US official since House speaker Nancy Pelosi went in August, prompting the North to condemn her as the “worst destroyer of international peace”.</Text></Article><Article paper="guardian" author="[{'name': 'Fiona Harvey Environment correspondent'}]"><Text>Carbon offsets are questionable, dangerous and far from a good investment for companies hoping to reduce their environmental impact, Australia’s richest man has said.Andrew Forrest, a billionaire turned philanthropist who made his fortune in mining and minerals, is turning his vast iron ore extraction operation, Fortescue Metals Group, into a zero carbon business.Unlike most companies, Fortescue is not seeking net zero greenhouse gas emissions but what Forrest described as “real zero”. To achieve net zero, many companies use carbon credits, awarded for projects such as planting trees or preserving existing forests, to count against their greenhouse gas emissions.Climate journalism, open to allForrest thinks this is a mistake and instead plans to use entirely renewable energy and zero-carbon technologies to transform his business.“Companies think they can continue piling emissions into the world, and cover their tracks with carbon offsets,” he said.“But carbon credits are really questionable,” he told the Guardian in an interview in London. “We are pushing beyond carbon credits.”Having examined the market for carbon credits, Forrest has concluded that only about 10% to 15% of available credits represent real reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.“I am an ecologist and I have seen how these credits get valued. Some are from just planting trees where trees would have been growing anyway,” he said. “Carbon credits are dangerous.”They are being relied upon increasingly as companies seek to become net zero but questions about the market for offsets are intensifying. Earlier this week, the airline Easyjet announced it would no longer use carbon offsetting to reach its net zero goals, but will invest further in low-carbon technologies for aviation.Easyjet to stop offsetting CO2 emissions from DecemberRead moreThe Guardian conducted a wide-ranging investigation of the market for forestry credits last year and found numerous problems, including “phantom credits” and questions over whether credits awarded for preserving and planting trees represented genuine “carbon sinks”.Forrest said the carbon markets merited deep investigation. “There are all sorts of cranks out there selling carbon credits,” he said. “This abuse must stop.”Forrest’s Minderoo Foundation charity targets plastic pollution , modern slavery and the climate crisis. Nicknamed Twiggy, he has announced plans to give away most of his $27bn fortune, has been criticised in Australia for controversial proposals on welfare for low-income people, for mining on Indigenous land, and by those who argue that tax is a better redistribution of wealth than philanthropy.Fortescue, whose profits topped US$6bn (£5.5bn) last year, will use solar and wind power, electric vehicles, hydrogen and hydro-electricity with pump storage to make its operations zero carbon by the end of this decade. Surplus renewable energy would be used to pump water uphill during times of excess generation, to be released to generate power when needed.Forrest insisted the strategy was not only technically feasible but could be achieved at a profit, thanks in part to the plummeting cost of wind and solar energy, and the soaring price of fossil fuels.“The biggest cost saving is on buying the fossil fuels,” he said. “Wind and sun don’t send you a bill at the end of the month. We have seen [from the Ukraine war and global gas crisis] how foolhardy it is to rely on fossil fuels.”Heavy industries, such as mining, have long been regarded as among the hardest sectors to decarbonise, but Forrest said the falling costs of renewable energy generation and the rapid development of technologies, such as batteries and hydrogen, meant there was little excuse for the sector not to move swiftly.He urged other companies to follow his lead. “The question is not why are we doing it – it’s why everyone else is not doing it.”</Text></Article><Article paper="guardian" author="[{'name': 'Emily Wind'}]"><Text>Optus customers have been left feeling vulnerable and outraged by the company’s poor communication a week after it announced a massive cyber-attack affecting millions of Australians.Karen Walker says finding clear information about what happened – and what data has been stolen – has been incredibly difficult.“There’s one email [from Optus], no advice on what we should do and we’re hearing more from the media than from Optus themselves,” Walker said.“I’m very concerned.

Under the plan, reliance on burning coal would cease by about 2035. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning However the Pioneer-Burdekin project remains in the very early stages and still requires significant planning and funding. The government said while it was confident the proposal is viable, it would continue to assess potential backup options.Queensland government pledges to end reliance on coal-fired power by 2035Read moreThe estimated cost for the project is $12bn. The Queensland government is yet to commit any money, though the project would probably not begin construction until 2025 at the earliest.It is expected the state would seek a significant federal contribution to the construction cost. “I’ve had very preliminary first conversations with the prime minister, and I know how much he is interested in nation-building infrastructure,” Palaszczuk said.Queensland Hydro, the new government entity designated to build the project, is expected to complete detailed geotechnical and environmental studies in 2024.In the meantime, the organisation will “also continue to investigate other large-scale, long-duration pumped hydro sites in the event the project is unable to proceed,” a government statement said.On Thursday Palaszczuk and the state’s energy minister, Mick de Brenni, said about 50 homes would be inundated under the plans, which involve the construction of three reservoirs. Negotiations will need to be conducted with the land owners and with Indigenous traditional owners.Environmental groups have largely welcomed the state’s renewable ambitions outlined in the energy plan. But some have also raised concern about the impacts of projects like the Pioneer-Burdekin.The Mackay Conservation Group on Thursday said it was concerned about the local environmental impacts of the project.“All of the water in the Pioneer catchment is already fully allocated for farmers, drinking water, and environmental flows,” said the group’s coordinator, Peter McCallum.“There simply is no available unallocated water to operate a pumped hydro scheme under the Pioneer valley water plan. One of these stakeholders will have to suffer.Sign up to Guardian Australia's Morning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing email breaks down the key national and international stories of the day and why they matterPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It would be designed to generate power and support the grid at times when wind and solar were unproductive.De Brenni said the government wanted to be respectful of landowners whose properties would need to be acquired for the project.“The resumptions that are involved in this are not significant in terms of their numbers and they are commensurate with the other types of infrastructure … for example, significant road projects,” he said.</Text></Article><Article paper="guardian" author="[{'name': 'Pjotr Sauer'}]"><Text>When Ilya returned from work on Wednesday, his wife was waiting for him with his military draft papers. Ilya said he quickly packed his bags and departed the next morning for his local recruitment centre in Irkutsk, a city on Lake Baikal in Siberia.“When the motherland comes calling, you have to answer,” the 27-year-old bus driver said in a brief phone interview from a training ground near the southern city of Rostov. “I decided that I am not going to dodge the draft and will defend the country.”‘I will cross the border tonight’: Russians flee after news of draft Read moreVladimir Putin’s mobilisation order has triggered a run for the borders by tens of thousands of men of fighting age who are unwilling to participate in Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.But standing in stark contrast to the mile-long lines to get out are videos of men across the country, to the applause of their wives and mothers, boarding buses that will take them to training centres, in what is likely to be a one-way journey for many.The men are evidence of some public backing for the war in Ukraine and of the growing polarisation in the country, said Denis Volkov of the Levada Centre, an independent polling agency. “The nation has split, and mobilisation has further exacerbated existing divisions,” Volkov said. “The western-oriented, more modern, urban segment of the population wants to leave and is against the draft. But there is still a large core of men that will not avoid the draft. They are often less educated, poorer and more reliant on the state.”The Kremlin, seemingly aware of those divisions, has been eager to tap into more rural areas for its mobilisation drive, with authorities reportedly looking to keep recruitment “to a minimum” in regional capitals.A poll published by Volkov’s Levada Centre on Thursday found that the proportion of Russians who “fully” or “somewhat” support what the Kremlin calls its “special military operation” has dropped since Putin ordered the mobilisation, but still stands at 72%. “Society consolidated when the war started, that will not change overnight,” Volkov said.While some observers have questioned the logic of polling public opinion in a country where information about the war is carefully curated by state television and opposition is punishable with prison time, Volkov said he believed the results were credible.He said a key source of support for the Russian military was the notion – hammered home daily on state television and held by many in the country – that Russia is engaged in a broader war with Nato and the United States.Interviews and polls show that some Russians have also accepted the Kremlin’s unfounded claim that Russia is under siege from the west and had no choice but to invade Ukraine.“My husband is fighting not only against Ukraine but also Nato. We don’t have many allies,” said Lyudmila, whose husband, Sergei, was mobilised this week.Since the start of the mobilisation, Telegram groups have sprung up in which women share tips on how to stay in touch with their partners or sons. Lyudmila, who runs one of the groups, said: “I am proud of my husband. Russia is pinned against the wall and we have to fight back.”For some men, a perceived inability to dodge the draft – an offence punishable by as much as 10 years in prison – has led them to reluctantly turn up at recruitment centres. “I don’t want to fight, but I can’t hide for ever, it is better to just face what is coming,” said Igor, from St Petersburg, who received his draft papers on Wednesday.But despite many Russians’ continued support for Putin’s invasion, Levada’s poll found that 70% of respondents had reacted with “fear” “terror” and “shock” to the mobilisation orders. It also found that Putin’s approval ratings had dropped by six points, the biggest decrease since the start of the war, with only a quarter of men under the age of 24 in favour of continuing the fighting in Ukraine.According to Andrei Kolesnikov, of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a US thinktank, Levada’s latest numbers hint at growing anger over the war among many in Russia. “It’s just the beginning, discontent is slowly maturing,” he said.The public’s anxiety over mobilisation is only likely to grow after the first videos emerged from training centres this week showing scores of men subjected to poor conditions as they wait to be sent to Ukraine.Expect dissent to rise as Putin’s call-up brings Ukraine war home to RussiansRead moreIn one video, a group of men are seen sleeping on the floor in overcrowded army barracks. In other footage, a recently mobilised unit appears to have been dropped off in an isolated field with no shelter or food rations. “There is fucking nothing here. Like a flock of sheep, we have to self-mobilise,” one of the men grumbles.There are also growing reports that newly mobilised men are tasked with buying their own equipment, ranging from bulletproof vests to sleeping mats and thermal underwear. “We spent over 30,000 rubles [£460], my monthly salary, to prepare him for the army,” said Tatyana, a school teacher from the Ural city of Chelyabinsk, whose husband has been mobilised.She said the lack of basic supplies in the army had shocked her, denting some of her previously held beliefs about the state of the country’s military and about the war. “How can they ask him to fight there when everything is such a mess?” she said. “The war should stop.”</Text></Article><Article paper="guardian" author="[{'name': 'Andrew Roth in Moscow and Isobel Koshiw in Kyiv'}]"><Text>Vladimir Putin will sign treaties on Friday annexing territories in occupied Ukraine, the Kremlin has said, in a major escalation of Russia’s seven-month-old war.The Russian president is expected to sign into law the annexations of the Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, where Russia held fake referendums over the last week in order to claim a mandate for the territorial claims.Russia-Ukraine war live: Vladimir Putin to sign decree formally annexing four Ukrainian regions on FridayRead morePutin has said he is ready to defend those territories using all available means, indicating that he would be willing to resort to a nuclear strike in order to avert Ukraine’s efforts to liberate its sovereign territory.Putin is seen to be passing a point of no return that will prolong the war and scuttle even the remotest chance of negotiations by obliging Russia to fight in perpetuity for Ukrainian territory, some of which it does not currently control.The signing of “treaties on the accession of territories into the Russian Federation” will take place at 3pm local time in the Kremlin’s St George’s Hall, the government spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters.Map“Putin is raising the stakes,” said Tatiana Stanovaya, a political analyst and founder of R.Politik. “It’s a demonstration that Russia is not ready to negotiate, not ready to make any concessions, and is ready to use any means at its disposal to achieve its strategic goals. Including nuclear weapons. The Russian leadership has said this directly without any hesitation.”The territories were not named formally but Kremlin pool reporters said four treaties would be signed, corresponding to the four regions Russia has indicated it plans to annex.Putin is expected to make a speech to members of the State Duma, Russia’s lower house of parliament, at Friday’s ceremony. By law, Russia’s Federation Council must approve the treaties before they are signed by Putin but it was not clear when the council was scheduled to meet.Moscow officials have also begun preparing a venue for a major concert near Red Square on Friday evening. “Together forever,” reads a large banner hanging over a stage that also bears the names of the four Ukrainian regions. State television channels are also displaying a countdown until Friday’s event at the Kremlin. Russian soldiers standing on Red Square where a banner on a stage reads: ‘Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson – Russia!’ Photograph: Alexander Nemenov/AFP/Getty ImagesPutin’s decision was believed to be an attempt to halt a Ukrainian counterattack that has forced Russia to retreat from much of the Kharkiv region and is now threatening to retake more territory in Donetsk. He hopes that the threat of all-out war and a nuclear retaliation will reduce western support for the Ukrainian offensive.Ukraine and its supporters have decried Putin’s threats as “nuclear blackmail”. In remarks earlier this week, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, vowed to defend and free Ukrainians in the occupied territories.“This farce in the occupied territory cannot even be called an imitation of referendums,” Zelenskiy said on Tuesday in a video posted on Telegram. “We will act to protect our people: both in the Kherson region, in the Zaporizhzhia region, in the Donbas, in the currently occupied areas of the Kharkiv region, and in the Crimea.”Ukraine’s presidential office said Zelenskiy had spoken to his Polish counterpart, Andrzej Duda, on Thursday about the international reaction to Russia’s illegal referendums. “We discussed specific steps and measures that we will work on in this context, military and defence cooperation,” Zelenskiy wrote on Telegram.The two leaders “agreed on the need for a powerful consolidated world reaction to the illegal actions of the Russian Federation, which destroy the foundations of international law”, the statement from Zelenskiy’s office read. “Specific steps and measures that the parties will work on in this context were discussed.” Zelenskiy also had a call with the outgoing Italian prime minister, Mario Draghi, on Thursday afternoon. According to Zelenskiy’s office, the main topic of their discussion was the need for a firm reaction to the fake referendums.“They are worthless and do not change reality. The territorial integrity of Ukraine will be restored. And our reaction to Russia’s recognition of their results will be very harsh,” Zelenskiy said, according to the statement from his office.Zelenskiy also said he was convening an “urgent” meeting of the national security council on Friday, with details to be announced later. The Kremlin does not have full control over many of the territories it is seeking to annex. It is likely the Kremlin will lay claim to all four Ukrainian regions in their entirety, including several mid-size cities that are not under Russian control. For instance, in the Zaporizhzhia region, local occupation officials claimed that the recent “referendum” included the entire region, including the city of Zaporizhzhia, which had a prewar population of 750,000. That would mean the Kremlin is obliging the country to fight in perpetuity to defend territories and make advances even while it is on the defensive on the battlefield.The Kremlin may only reveal the details of which territories it is claiming to annex during the signing ceremony. A state budget revealed on Thursday showed that Russia had earmarked 3.3bn roubles ($56.3m or £51.1m) to rebuild the regions. The damage to the city of Mariupol alone was estimated by its mayor at $14bn. The annexation will make the chance of a negotiated settlement to end the war even more remote. Russia amended its constitution in 2022 to forbid ceding territory the country has formally annexed.It was initially seen as a way to prevent a future Russian leader from ceding Crimea, which was annexed in 2014. But the law would also forbid Russia from ceding territories occupied since February or those not currently under Kremlin control.Ekaterina Schulmann, a Russian political scientist, wrote that after annexation, the “Russian Federation as we knew it will pass into a new phase of its existence, having become a state with a delegitimised border, including fragments that not only won’t be recognised by any state or international organisation de jure, but won’t be controlled by its central administration de facto”.</Text></Article><Article paper="guardian" author="[{'name': 'Léonie Chao-Fong and Martin Belam'}]"><Text> Vladimir Putin will sign a decree annexing four occupied regions in Ukraine tomorrow, the Kremlin has announced. Russian state-owned news agency Tass cites Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, as saying that the ceremony of the signing of agreements into the Russian Federation will be held on Friday at 3pm Moscow time. The total area set to become de facto part of Russia amounts to about 15% of Ukraine and includes an estimated 4 million people. Following the signing ceremonies in the Kremlin, Putin will give a major speech and will meet with Moscow-appointed administrators of the Ukrainian regions, the Kremlin said. On Moscow’s Red Square, giant video screens have already been set up, with billboards proclaiming “Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson – Russia!” President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said overnight Ukraine will “act to protect our people” in Russian-occupied regions after what he described as “an imitation of referendums”. Ukraine’s foreign ministry said Kyiv and its allies “condemn such actions of Russia and consider them null and worthless”. Zelenskiy’s spokesperson Sergii Nykyforov has said Ukraine’s president has called an emergency meeting of security and defence officials for Friday. Sweden’s coast guard earlier this week discovered a fourth gas leak on the damaged Nord Stream pipelines, a coast guard spokesperson told the Svenska Dagbladet newspaper. Politicians across Europe have warned that the suspected sabotaging of the two Nord Stream pipelines could herald a new stage of hybrid warfare targeting vulnerable energy infrastructure in order to undermine support of Ukraine. Norway’s prime minister, Jonas Gahr Støre, said his country would step up its military presence at Norwegian installations after the country became Europe’s largest supplier of natural gas. Denmark’s foreign minister, Jeppe Kofod, has said that “intentional” explosions caused the leaks in the Nord Stream pipelines, and that it was an “unprecedented” attack. Nato has said leaks from the Nord Stream gas pipelines appeared to be “deliberate acts of sabotage” and vowed a “united and determined response” to any attacks on their critical infrastructure. The Kremlin on Wednesday dismissed claims that Russia was behind the attack on the Nord Stream gas pipelines, describing them as “quite predictable and also predictably stupid”. In a call with reporters, the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said the incident needed to be investigated and that the timings for the repair of the damaged pipelines were not clear. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, has proposed a fresh round of sanctions on Russia designed “to make the Kremlin pay” for escalating the conflict in Ukraine. The proposed eighth package of “biting” sanctions includes a cap on the price of Russian oil and further curbs on hi-tech trade. An EU official has given a briefing to Reuters saying that an agreement on the next sanctions package against Russia is expected before next week’s EU summit, or at least major parts of the package. Hungary will not support the EU’s proposed new round of sanctions if they include energy sanctions, a government official has said. A report drawn up by an international working group on sanctions concluded Russia should now be declared a “state sponsor of terrorism” and had reached the legal definition of a terrorist state under US and Canadian law. The head of the Office of the Ukrainian Presidency, Andriy Yermak, called for sweeping American and European sanctions in light of the report, after Ukraine accused Russia of sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines under the Baltic Sea. Britain’s prime minister, Liz Truss, told Zelenskiy in a phone call Wednesday that the UK would never recognise Russian attempts to annex parts of Ukraine, Downing Street said. The EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, also denounced the “illegal referenda and their falsified outcome” in Ukraine. Israel has strengthened its hitherto cautious stance on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, saying it will “not accept the results of the referendum in the eastern districts” of the occupied country. Tuesday night’s statement from the Israeli foreign ministry, which also said it “recognises the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine”, has been received as an unprecedented show of support for Ukraine, and a rare Israeli rebuke to Moscow. Russia has escalated its use of Iranian-supplied “kamikaze” drones in southern Ukraine, including against the southern port of Odesa and the nearby city of Mykolaiv, amid estimates that hundreds of weapons may now have been deployed by the Kremlin in Crimea and other occupied areas of the south. The head of Ukraine’s presidential administration, Andriy Yermak, has said six Ukrainians have been exchanged in a prisoner swap. The six included two civilians, who were arrested and taken to Russia because of the content on their phones, and four Ukrainian soldiers, who fought in Mariupol. They have been returned to Ukraine. Finland is closing its border to Russian tourists after Vladimir Putin’s partial mobilisation order prompted large numbers of people to flee the country. From midnight Finnish time Thursday (9pm GMT), Russian tourists holding an EU Schengen visa will be turned away unless they have a family tie or compelling reason to stay. Authorities in the Russian region of North Ossetia, which borders Georgia, are reportedly putting in place travel restrictions to prevent people fleeing to Georgia to avoid conscription. The report by the Moscow Times cites the head of the region, Sergey Menyaylo, as saying that more than 20,000 people had entered Georgia through the section of the border in just the past two days. The UK ministry of defence has claimed in its latest intelligence briefing that more men have now likely fled conscription from Russia’s partial mobilisation than Russia initially used in its invasion force of Ukraine. Russian authorities say they are establishing checkpoints at some of the country’s borders to forcibly mobilise Russian men seeking to avoid mobilisation by fleeing the country. Social media footage shows military vehicles moving toward the border, reportedly to establish the mobilisation checkpoint. Ukrainian authorities said Wednesday they have identified five Russian soldiers who allegedly shot at civilian cars in the Kyiv region during the first days of the war. The Russian soldiers are charged with killing five people, and injuring a further six, who were trying to flee Hostomel on 25 February, a day after Russia invaded. </Text></Article><Article paper="guardian" author="[{'name': 'Angelique Chrisafis in Paris'}]"><Text>French ministers have been photographed in puffer jackets and polo necks instead of suits, in an attempt to set an example on wrapping up warm as the nation struggles to afford heating this winter.But political opponents attacked the government’s winter wardrobe messaging as nannying and out of touch with people’s struggles over the energy crisis and cost of living.The far-right Marine Le Pen, who heads the largest opposition party in parliament, made a comparison to the French queen Marie Antoinette, tweeting: “Don’t have enough heating? Let them wear cashmere.”After the president, Emmanuel Macron, said people would need to save energy and lower their heating, the prime minister, Élisabeth Borne, raised eyebrows this week when she held an office meeting seated at her desk wearing a zipped-up puffer jacket.Pendant le « col roulé gate » de @BrunoLeMaire… la PM @Elisabeth_Borne ne veut pas être en reste et continue à arborer une doudoune lors de ses entretiens à Matignon (à l’intérieur).

He said: “So you’ll no longer see me in a suit and tie, but in a polo neck.

Gaspard Gantzer, a former communications adviser to the Socialist president François Hollande, said it was “grotesque” and “paternalistic” form of messaging. “There’s an element of ‘my dear children, do as your parents do, wear a big jumper.’”Macron warns of ‘end of abundance’ as France faces difficult winterRead moreThomas Porcher, an economist, told France Inter radio: “I don’t expect an economy minster for the sixth or seventh economy in the world to tell me to put a polo neck on. That’s for my mother or grandmother to do.” He said the major issue was how France had organised its energy sector.Gilles Le Gendre, a Paris lawmaker for Macron’s centrist party, then drew accusations of being out of touch with everyday reality when he told France Info television that politicians should set an example on saving energy.“For example, my wife and I no longer use a tumble dryer, we hang our laundry. Honestly it’s not that complicated to do,” he said.Environmentalists accused the government of promoting tiny measures while failing to take enough action on the climate crisis.</Text></Article><Article paper="guardian" author="[{'name': 'Philip Oltermann in Berlin'}]"><Text>Germany’s finance minister has vowed that he will not follow the UK “down the path of an expansionary fiscal policy” as his government announced a €200bn (£177bn) fund designed to protect consumers and businesses from rising gas prices driven by Russia’s war in Ukraine.Europe’s largest economy will reactivate an economic stabilising fund previously used during the global financial crisis and the coronavirus pandemic, said the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, at a joint press conference with the finance minister, Christian Lindner, and the economic minister, Robert Habeck, on Thursday afternoon.Truss says she has ‘right plan’ on economy and will not change courseRead more“Prices have to come down. That is our conviction,” said Scholz, adding: “For them to come down, we will need a big defence shield.”Expansionary fiscal policies include tax cuts and government spending with the aim of boosting the economy. But they run the risk of causing high inflation and devaluing the currency, as has happened in the UK.Lindner, of the fiscally hawkish Free Democratic party, said the energy price package would not entail further regular borrowing, adding that Germany was “expressly not following Great Britain’s example down the path of an expansionary fiscal policy”.“This process is not risky,” he later added.The economic stabilising fund was set up in 2020 and filled with €500bn to aid businesses affected by lockdown measures. While it is still financed by the state taking on new debt, the fund can only be used for paying for specific measures and thus does not count as part of the regular household budget.Critics say the special crisis fund is a sleight of hand that will allow Germany only on paper to return next year to the debt-to-GDP ratio restrictions that Lindner’s party has championed. The new €200bn “shadow budget” for the energy crisis comes on top of a €100bn fund for rebuilding its military and a €60bn booster for a special fund for climate protection measures that have been passed by Scholz’s coalition government.At the heart of the package is a temporary cap on electricity and gas prices, which the government says it wants to bring down “to a level where private households and companies are protected from being overloaded”. The difference between the cap and the prices paid by gas importers on the world market would be made up by the state.In a significant U-turn, Scholz’s government is also scrapping a gas levy on consumers that was due to come in this Saturday. The levy was originally designed to compensate energy suppliers for the increased import costs. But after being agreed by the three coalition parties this summer, it was increasingly seen as politically toxic for rewarding some energy companies already raking in record profits.Sign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterArchie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morningPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The head of Germany’s federal network agency warned earlier this week that savings targets were not being met and that households were using more, rather than less, gas than in previous years. </Text></Article><Article paper="guardian" author="[{'name': 'Patrick Wintour Diplomatic editor'}]"><Text>Iran has launched a deadly cross-border airstrike into northern Iraq to punish Kurds for their role in supporting demonstrations over the death of a 22-year-old Kurdish woman in Iranian police custody that are still rattling the Tehran regime.As many as 13 people were killed and 58 injured in the Iranian drone strikes on military bases in northern Iraq that belong to the exiled Kurdish Democratic party of Iran.The KDPI said in a statement: “The forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran attacked the bases and headquarters of the Kurdistan Democratic party of Iran with missiles and drones.”Iran said it was attacking terrorist bases, while the US described the strikes as brazen.The attack occurred as the Iranian president, Ebrahim Raisi, addressed the nation to express his regret over the death of Mahsa Amini a fortnight ago, but also to accuse the protesters of being agents of foreign powers.“The enemy has targeted national unity and wants to pit people against each other,” the ultraconservative president said.Raisi said Iran would not tolerate “chaos and riots” but also said that there could be “dialogue” on “different methods of applying the law” – a possible reference to Iran’s morality police’s strict enforcement of compulsory hijab.It was the first time Raisi has directly addressed the street protests on national TV but his mention of dialogue is unlikely to assuage an assertive young generation of Iranians who have lost faith in the elderly clerical establishment – especially as it was the hardline president who ordered a stricter application of the hijab laws earlier this summer.Activists in Iran, speaking to the Guardian on condition of anonymity, said: “Our confidence is growing. We are not backing down despite the arrests. It is very beautiful. There is a belief that something is going to change this time.”How the death of a Kurdish woman galvanised women all over IranRead moreLawyers acting for Amini’s family have, in defiance of regime pressure, filed a formal complaint against those responsible for her arrest. They have demanded a detailed independent investigation into her death, including the manner of arrest and transfer to hospital, as well as photographs and videos of the arrest, and any brain scans.Amini, now a symbol of resistance to the regime, died in police custody after she was picked up by the morality police in Tehran for not wearing a hijab properly.The KPDI urged its supporters inside Iran to return to the streets, with its London spokesperson saying: “Support for these demonstrations is building. This started about one Kurdish woman and the wearing of the hijab, but it is now something wider in over 100 cities. The chant in the streets is: ‘Death to the regime. Death to the dictator.’”Reports on the number of deaths amid the protests differ; the Oslo-based human rights group Iran Human Rights said the figure was at least 76, while Iran’s semi-official Fars news agency has put the toll at “around 60”, including several members of the Iranian security forces.The regime will be desperate to ensure the protests do not extend to more working-class districts, and is likely to portray the protesters as anti-patriotic liberals at odds with the values of the regime.Iran’s police said on Wednesday they would confront protests “with all their might”. However, the country’s minister for women’s affairs, Ensieh Khazali, said she had visited arrested women in jail and was seeking the release of those not guilty of major offences.The UN said its secretary general, António Guterres, had called on Raisi not to use “disproportionate force” against protesters.“We are increasingly concerned about reports of rising fatalities, including women and children, related to the protests,” the UN chief’s spokeperson, Stéphane Dujarric, said.Iran has shut down the internet to prevent protesters using social media to inform the outside world of the scale of the repression. Up to 20 reporters have been arrested, and newspapers are increasingly toeing the government line that the protests are being manipulated by Saudi Arabian or western media. Some papers are staging debates on whether the compulsory hijab is required by sharia law.The regime has continued to claim the west’s response followed what it regarded as a successful performance by Raisi at the UN general assembly in New York. But the regime is being battered by the persistence of the demonstrations and the willingness of prominent Iranians, including musicians, actors, sports stars and academics, to demand the voice of young Iranians be respected.Fatemeh Motamed-Arya, an award-winning actor, appeared without hijab to speak at the funeral ceremony of fellow actor Amin Tariokh. The Iranian football coach and former player Ali Karimi has also backed the demonstrations, as has the composer Hossein Alizadeh.In Britain, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British Iranian dual-national who spent five years in an Iranian jail, cut her hair for BBC Persian cameras to show solidarity with the protests in Iran.Companies said the continued shutdown of the internet was damaging business.On Tuesday, authorities in Iran arrested the daughter of the former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani for “inciting rioters”, the Tasnim news agency reported.

The human rights lawyer has been moved to a 2 x 2 sq metre isolation cell in Hadarim, a maximum security prison.Administrative detention allows suspects’ arrest for renewable six-month terms without charge or access to the evidence against them, on the grounds that he or she may break the law in future.Israel says the measure – which is also practised by the Palestinian Authority – is necessary for foiling terrorist attacks and to avoid revealing sensitive intelligence sources. Rights groups allege it is used excessively by Israeli authorities and denies individuals the right to due process.According to the Palestinian prisoners’ rights group Addameer, where Hamouri works, 743 Palestinians are being held in administrative detention, the highest number for six years.Hamouri has been imprisoned by Israel on several previous occasions, including serving a seven-year sentence between 2005-11 for his alleged role in a plot to assassinate a chief rabbi.After maintaining his innocence during three years of pre-trial detention, he eventually took a plea bargain on the advice of his lawyer in order to avoid a 14-year-sentence or deportation to France, which would most likely mean losing his Israel-issued Jerusalem residency.In 2016, his pregnant wife, French national Elsa Lefort, was deported after arriving at Tel Aviv’s airport and given a 10-year entry ban. She and the couple’s two young children live in France, and have not been allowed to visit or even speak to Hamouri on the phone since he was detained in March.“Salah has never stopped being vocal about the occupation. He is always speaking at events in France and tours, talking about the conditions of political prisoners and other violations,” said a spokesperson for #JusticeforSalah.“Treating him like this is a way to try and silence him, to break him, and send a message to other human rights defenders.”Of the four legal cases Hamouri is fighting, one is of particular concern to rights organisations: in a legal first, the lawyer’s Jerusalem residency was revoked in October 2021 on the grounds of a “breach of allegiance” to the Israeli state, based on secret evidence. A final hearing in the residency case is scheduled for February 2023.In a statement, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said that Hamouri was detained on suspicion of activity in the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, which is designated as a terrorist organisation by Israel’s western allies.“Moreover, it was determined that the confidential material in his case indicates that his release will impair the security of the area,” a spokeswoman said.The last high-profile Palestinian hunger strike involved the Islamic Jihad member Khalil Awawdeh, who almost died after going without food for nearly six months. He ended his strike in August after Israel agreed to release him when the administrative detention order expires on Sunday.

The Biden administration had been asked by a US judge to weigh in on whether Prince Mohammed ought to be protected by sovereign immunity in a case brought by the fiancee of Khashoggi, Hatice Cengiz. Such protection is usually granted to a world leader, such as a prime minister or a king.In July the administration sought a delay in filing its response to the court, which had initially been sought by 1 August. John Bates, a district court judge, agreed to extend the deadline to 3 October. Among other issues, he called on the administration to state whether it believed Prince Mohammed ought to be granted immunity under rules that protect countries’ head of state.“It seems like [Prince Mohammed] has been advised to take this step before the response of the Biden administration was due on 3 October,” said Abdullah Alaoudh, the Gulf director at Dawn, a pro-democracy group based in Washington, who is a party to the Khashoggi lawsuit. “Practically, [becoming prime minister] makes no difference.”The White House did not immediately comment. Prince Mohammed has denied he had personal involvement in the Khashoggi murder. A US intelligence assessment found that the future king was likely to have ordered the killing.The decision to name Prince Mohammed as prime minister would also likely assuage any lingering concerns in Saudi Arabia that the crown prince could be arrested or otherwise face legal challenges while traveling abroad.The civil complaint against Prince Mohammed, which was filed by Cengiz in the federal district court of Washington DC in October 2020, alleges that he and other Saudi officials acted in a “conspiracy and with premeditation” when Saudi agents kidnapped, bound, drugged, tortured and killed Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018.Khashoggi, a former Saudi insider who had fled the kingdom and was a resident of Virginia in the south-east US, was a vocal critic of the crown prince and was actively seeking to counter Saudi online propaganda at the time when he was killed.Cengiz said in a statement to the Guardian: “The fight for justice must succeed – it will not be stopped because MBS bestows another title on himself.”Critics of the Saudi regime, including activists who are living in exile in the US and Europe, have warned that the crown prince’s crackdown on dissent has intensified in recent months.The Guardian has learned that the UK government has sought to intervene in at least one high-profile case, involving Salma al-Shehab, a Leeds University PhD student who was arrested, charged, convicted and sentenced to 34 years in prison after she returned home from the UK for a holiday. Her crime, under Saudi law, was using Twitter to follow and sometimes like or retweet tweets by dissidents and activists.The Guardian was told by a source requesting anonymity that officials in the British embassy in Riyadh have raised concerns about Shehab’s case with Saudi authorities. Tariq Ahmad, a Conservative peer, has also raised the case in a 25 August meeting with the Saudi ambassador to the UK, the source said.The UK government will face more pressure to act this week with the expected release of a letter by 400 academics, including staff and research students from UK universities and colleges who are seeking urgent action on Shehab’s case.The letter calls on Liz Truss, the prime minister, and foreign secretary James Cleverly to “publicly condemn Salma al-Shehab’s sentencing and make representations to their Saudi counterparts for her immediate release”. It was sponsored by the pro-democracy group Alqst, which advocates for human rights in Saudi Arabia. The group said: “Salma should be looking forward, like us, to the new academic year, instead of languishing behind bars for the ‘crime’ of tweeting her legitimate opinions.”The letter notes that Shehab, a 34-year-old mother of two children who worked as a dental hygienist and had received a scholarship to study in the UK, was arrested on 15 January 2021 while on holiday in Saudi Arabia. Court records show she was placed in solitary confinement, questioned and held for 285 days before her trial. She denies the allegations against her.Truss has so far not indicated that she will be likely to adopt a critical stance toward her new counterpart. The British prime minister had a phone call with Prince Mohammed this week in which her office said she thanked him for helping to get five British detainees released by Russian-backed forces. She also offered the UK’s “continued support and encouragement for progress in Saudi Arabia’s domestic reforms”.</Text></Article><Article paper="guardian" author="[{'name': 'Reuters in Doha'}]"><Text>Qatar has called up hundreds of civilians, including diplomats summoned back from overseas, for mandatory military service operating security checkpoints at World Cup stadiums, according to a source and documents seen by Reuters.The deployment of conscripts, some of whom would normally defer national service because their work is considered vital, highlights the logistical challenge faced by the tiny Gulf Arab state hosting one of the world’s biggest sports tournaments.The conscripts are training to manage stadium security queues, frisk fans and detect contraband such as alcohol, drugs or weapons concealed in ponytails, jacket linings or even false bellies, according to training materials seen by Reuters.Qatar has a population of 2.8 million – of whom barely 380,000 are Qatari nationals – and expects an unprecedented influx of 1.2 million visitors for the tournament. It already has an agreement with Turkey, which is supplying 3,000 riot police.In early September, the civilians were ordered to report for pre-dawn duty at the national service camp north of the Qatari capital, Doha, according to order papers seen by Reuters, less than three months before the 29-day tournament kicks off.The civilians were told they had been called up to assist with the World Cup and that it was their “patriotic duty” to do so, the source said. “Most people are there because they have to be – they don’t want to get in trouble,” the source said.Some volunteers are also training alongside the conscripted force, according to the source, who has direct knowledge of the plan and the training.Asked for comment, a Qatari government official said in a statement that Qatar’s national service programme would continue as normal during the World Cup.“Recruits will provide additional support during the tournament as part of the regular programme, just as they do every year at major public events, such as the national day celebrations,” the statement added.Prove World Cup will be safe, England LGBTQ+ supporters’ group tells QatarRead moreSince 2014, Qatari men aged between 18 and 35 have trained with the military for at least four months as part of mandatory national service introduced by the emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani. Dodging the duty can mean a year in prison and a fine of 50,000 Qatari rials (£13,000).The current group of civilians were on four months of paid leave from their jobs at key Qatari institutions such as the state-owned QatarEnergy and the foreign ministry, the source said. The diplomats are expected to return to their posts after the World Cup.Conscripts reported to the national service camp five days a week, where they attended training sessions conducted by officials from the security division of Qatar’s World Cup organisers, the supreme committee for delivery and legacy, the source said.They were taught to approach fans with “positive body language, focus and a smile”, the source said, to abide by the universal declaration of human rights, and avoid discriminating against fans on any basis, the source said.Training also includes hour-long marching drills on the parade ground.The 80,000-capacity Lusail Stadium, built for the final, had its first near-capacity crowd earlier this month. Fans leaving the stadium queued for hours for the metro and organisers ran out of water at half-time on a hot late-summer Gulf evening.</Text></Article><Article paper="guardian" author="[{'name': 'Martin Chulov  Middle East correspondent'}]"><Text>When a young Kurdish woman, Mahsa Amini, died in regime custody 10 days ago, Kurdish corners of Iran were the first to erupt; their anger at leaders they say have long oppressed them had an incendiary effect in their towns and cities.The death of the 22-year-old while on a visit to Tehran – allegedly for wearing her headscarf incorrectly under the country’s hijab regulations – quickly became a potent symbol of defiance for a minority group that had long harboured nationalistic ambitions, which rarely stayed hidden, and often eschewed the values of the country’s hardline leaders.But something happened along the way to what could have been a Kurdish nationalist uprising; Iranians from across the country fast shared in the outrage of the death of Amini and the collective indignity it represented to a greater population. Soon protesters on the streets of most of the country’s provinces were testing the limits of state forces. “It is not an Iranian revolution, or even a Kurdish revolution,” said Rozhin, 25, from the Kurdish city of Kermanshah. “It is a women’s revolution.”Demonstrations against the theocratic state’s stance towards women show little sign of slowing down in many parts of Iran. Women, who bear the brunt of state constraints, have been particularly vocal, tearing down pictures of Grand Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the assassinated general Qassem Suleimani. Both acts were unthinkable even months ago, but so too was the spectacle of large numbers of women – Kurdish, Persian and minorities – taking to the streets without hijabs.“It’s now not about Kurdish movement, neither about Persians,” said Karim, 27, from the town of Bokan. “It’s about 85 million humans who are fighting back for their rights, socially, economically and in every aspect of life. One week ago a Kurdish girl was a stranger in the capital of Iran and now her face is known everywhere around the globe. This is not about national movement – this is beyond that; it’s about women, and it’s about our basic human rights.“At this moment, every individual is thinking about fundamental aims and problems to be solved. But I do not guarantee that after one year the Kurds have another way of thinking about Persians.”Kurds in Iran account for roughly 10% of the country’s population, and make up roughly a quarter of the greater Kurdish presence in the Middle East, scattered between west and eastern Iran, northern Iraq, northern Syria and southeastern Turkey. A century after the breakdown of post-first world war Ottoman boundaries, there is no Kurdish state, and numerous groups vie among populations to claim leadership roles among what remains a fractured population whose search for a homeland has remained elusive.Five years ago this week, Iraq’s Kurds held a referendum on statehood, which was passed overwhelmingly. However, within days, Iraq’s army, led by powerful militias and directed by Suleimani, pushed north to seize the oil city of Kirkuk and retake much of the land seized by Kurds after the ousting of Saddam Hussein in 2003.Ever since, there have been few moments to galvanise Kurds in either Iraq, or Iran –until Amini’s death in the custody of Iran’s morality police. The feared enforcers have become central targets of the demonstration and held up as examples of where Kurds diverge from the central government.“There is no doubting the Kurdish revolutionary fervour that Mahsa Amini’s death has sparked among Iran’s long-oppressed Kurdish population,” said Ranj Aladdin, senior fellow at the Middle East Council on Global Affairs. “But her brutal death has come to symbolise something much bigger than the Kurdish cause in Iran that strikes at the very heart of the political and ideological system that underpins the Islamic Republic.“While her name will be exploited by other opponents of the regime, for the first time since 1979 the Kurdish cause in Iran has become intertwined with that of other oppressed communities. What that means for Kurdish human rights in the immediate future remains to be seen, but – if and when the regime survives this uprising – it is the Kurds who will most likely be in the cross-hairs of its violent response.”Rozhin says the aftermath of the demonstrations is not being considered, for now. “Women are struggling so much with so many problems. It’s obvious that people do not only have an issue with the hijab, but the system of government. They have changed the definition of Islam. They are killing many people. They are denying every single right of women. They don’t allow us to choose. It’s not only about the hijab issue – it’s about our right to make choices.”Another woman, a resident of Tehran who refused to be named, said the protests had electrified women across the country. “It’s happening in ways that have never been known before. Even if we don’t win, we’ve already won in many ways. The state cannot ignore us now. Our stance has made them weaker.”Additional reporting by Nechirvan Mando This article was amended on 29 September 2022.

The main options are helping to prevent the internet being shut by Iran, and further economic sanctions.Demonstrators at the street protests – now in their 10th day – have also called for greater support from the west, as well as help in communicating with the outside world.The spokesperson for the Iranian the foreign ministry, Nasser Kanaani, has condemned the US for trying to help those seeking to bypass the Iranian internet shutdown, saying the action taken by the US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) last Friday was “another sign this country is seeking to weaken the security and stability of Iran”.He said the US action would not go unanswered.Iran protests: at least 450 arrested in northern provinceRead moreMore than 75 people have been killed in the Iranian authorities’ crackdown against the unrest, a rights group said on Monday. The Iranian authorities’ official death toll, meanwhile, remained at 41, including several members of the security forces.Traditional VPNs are not always effective in Iran, and Elon Musk, the owner of SpaceX, on Friday persuaded the US Treasury to lift any threat of sanctions if he helped Iranian protesters by introducing the Starlink satellite internet service in the country. Starlink users are able to bypass a country’s terrestrial communications networks, freeing them from internet censorship.But Musk has said his Starlink requires terminals – dish and router – inside the country – something the Iranian government is unlikely to support, requiring him to take the risk of being sued by Iran in the international courts if he presses ahead without their support.Starlink’s activation in Ukraine earlier this year is not comparable since the Ukrainian government supported his move once its own communication networks were disrupted by Russia’s invasion.The EU is understood to be looking at how it can encourage more software companies to sign the Danish foreign ministry-backed “Copenhagen pledge on tech for democracy”, a statement on how to keep the internet open and free.The ambassadors of the UK and Norway to Iran were also summoned to the Iranian foreign ministry in protest at the two European countries’ stance.The head of the Iranian judiciary has been issuing ever stronger warnings about the punishment that will be meted out to those who took to the streets or supported those who did.Shutting down the internet is another brutal blow against women by the Iranian regime | Azadeh AkbariRead moreIn the US, Republican senators are calling for the US to announce it is withdrawing from the negotiations on the future of the Iran nuclear deal. Senator Marsha Blackburn wrote: “The Iranian government murdered a woman for not wearing a headscarf.

I am used to coming out on roads … facing brutal violence from the police. The world should show the cruel face of this regime,” said Mohammed, a 25-year-old protester who uses only a single name. “We call on the west to sanction this regime. The entire Iran has woken up to the unprecedented resistance spread in the smaller cities too. Global leaders should come up and help Iranian people.”A 23-year-old female protester said: “We need help to be heard as they shut down the internet, they are killing more than 100 people every day across the country and they make sure less footage goes out [so] they can make it seem it’s not as violent as it is.“We are clashing with the police every time but we will fight and come out daily to throw this regime out.”</Text></Article><Article paper="guardian" author="[{'name': 'Shaikh Azizur Rahman'}]"><Text>An Islamic organisation that says it fights discrimination against minorities in India has disbanded after the government declared it and its affiliates unlawful, accusing them of involvement in terrorism.The government of Narendra Modi’s Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) accused the Popular Front of India (PFI) group of having been involved in “terrorism” and “anti-national activities”.The ban, under a strict anti-terrorism law, came amid a crackdown in which 300 PFI leaders and activists have been arrested.The PFI branch in the southern state of Kerala said that it had worked only “for the socio-economic empowerment of the downtrodden people”.“But as law-abiding citizens of our great country, we accept the home ministry’s decision (to ban the PFI). We also inform all that the PFI has been disbanded,” the statement said.PFI leaders have previously said that the terrorism accusations were baseless.“These cases against us are all fabricated. We are victims of a political vendetta by the BJP-led government,” Anis Ahmed, the general secretary of PFI, said just before he was arrested last week.Muslims, who make up more than 15% of India’s 1.4 billion population, often complain of persecution in the Hindu-majority country, and note that the marginalisation of the community has been increasingly prominent under the BJP. The BJP and the government deny the accusations.Founded in 2006 in Kerala, the PFI claims to fight for the rights of minorities and low-caste Hindus.On its website, the organisation calls itself a movement that aims to establish an “egalitarian society where everyone enjoys freedom, justice and a sense of security”.The PFI supported the protest against a 2019 citizenship law that according to its critics discriminated against Muslims. It also supported this year’s protests in the southern state of Karnataka by Muslim girls who demanded their right to wear hijab in educational institutions.India’s home ministry said in a statement that the organisation had “been found to be involved in serious offences, including terrorism and its financing, targeted gruesome killings, disregarding the constitutional setup of the country”.The PFI “encourages extremism”, “disrupts the communal harmony” and “has ties with the banned groups like Simi [Students Islamic Movement of India] and [Bangladeshi terrorist group] Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh”, a government gazette that declared the ban said.According to the gazette notification, “there is evidence that the group has a connection with the international terrorist group Isis”.PFI leaders rebutted the charge. “There are mainstream media reports describing how our top leaders condemned the Isis. The allegation that this organisation had links with the Isis is ridiculously false,” one Kerala-based leader said on condition of anonymity.“We are confident, all major charges against the PFI and its leaders will be found to be false if the trials in the court are conducted properly.”Security expert Swaran Ram Darapuri, a retired police services officer, said the allegations against PFI seemed to be preconceived as “no related specific charge or crime has been investigated or proved” in the cases.“Only some general allegations have been made against the PFI. The organisation has been accused of being involved in terrorism-related activities, among other charges. Those serious charges should have been thoroughly investigated and proved in a court of law before taking any action like banning the organisation,” said Darapuri, who is also a human rights activist.“The widespread raids and arrests accompanied by diatribes were carried out to malign the organisation. The whole exercise of the crackdown seems to be biased and motivated.”Condemning the ban, the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) – the PFI’s political wing – called it a “direct blow to democracy and human rights”.“Freedom of speech, protests and organisations has been ruthlessly suppressed by the regime against the basic principles of the Indian constitution. The regime is misusing the investigation agencies and laws to silence the opposition and to scare the people from expressing the voice of dissent,” the SDPI statement said.</Text></Article><Article paper="guardian" author="[{'name': 'Lauren Aratani'}]"><Text>The body of the renowned US big-mountain skier Hilaree Nelson was found on Wednesday morning after she fell down a narrow 5,000ft slope during a trek in the Himalayas two days earlier.Nelson and her partner, Jim Morrison, had scaled the 26,781ft peak of Manaslu on Monday morning. They reached the summit at 10.42am “in tough conditions”, Morrison wrote in an Instagram post on Wednesday. The pair transitioned from climbing to skiing down to regroup with their sherpa team.“I skied first, and after a few turns Hilaree followed, and started a small avalanche. She was swept off her feet and carried down a narrow snow slope down the south side (opposite from climbing route) of the mountain over 5,000 [feet],” Morrison wrote. “I did everything I could to locate her, but was unable to go down that face as I hoped to find her alive and live my life with her.“I spent the last two days searching from the air in a helicopter.”Morrison wrote that he and a rescue team landed at 22,000ft and found her body on Wednesday morning.Nelson, 49, who has two children, is one of the highest-profile mountaineers, with a career spanning two decades. North Face described her as “the most prolific ski mountaineer of her generation” on its website.In 2012, she became the first woman to climb both the summit of Everest and the peak of adjacent mountain Lhotse within 24 hours.In 2018, the resident of Telluride, Colorado, was awarded the National Geographic Adventurer of the Year award after making the first ski down Lhotse that year.“There are no words to describe the love for this woman, my life partner, my lover, my best friend, and my mountain partner,” Morrison wrote. “My loss is indescribable and I am focused on her children and their steps forward.”Friends of Nelson told National Geographic that in addition to being an accomplished athlete, Nelson was known for her grit and grace in the face of challenges.“She had heroic strengths – not only in mountains, but in her community, and her family,” climber and videographer Renan Ozturk, a friend of Nelson’s, told National Geographic. “The resilience she had to be out of her comfort zone and laugh in the face of dire situations speaks to her positivity.”Conditions on Manaslu were harsh in the days before Nelson and Morrison ascended to the mountain’s peak. On Instagram last week, Nelson expressed doubt that they would end up making it to the summit as heavy rain and humidity was making climbing difficult.“I haven’t felt as sure-footed on Manaslu as I have on past adventures into the thin atmosphere of the high Himalaya,” she wrote. “These past weeks have tested my resilience in new ways.”Also on Monday, a separate avalanche in a lower portion of the mountain killed one climber and injured a dozen others.Manaslu, the eighth-tallest mountain in the world, has seen a busy climbing season in its high peaks.

His friend Aznan was injured and is being treated in a hospital.“As soon as they set foot on the roof, they were hit by lightning and my son died,” said Mohammad Ayub, Usman’s father.Officials said 39 people had been killed by lightning in the past five days, prompting authorities to issue new guidelines advising people how to protect themselves during a thunderstorm.Lightning strikes are common during India’s monsoon season, which runs from June to September.Col Sanjay Srivastava, whose organisation Lightning Resilient India Campaign works with the Indian Meteorological Department, said deforestation, pollution and the depletion of bodies of water all contributed to climate breakdown, which was leading to more lightning.Global heating had increased the frequency of lightning, said Sunita Narain, director general at the Center for Science and Environment. A 1C rise in temperature increases lightning by 12 times.There has been a 34% rise in lightning strikes across India over the past year, which has caused deaths to jump.

But since 2013, numerous top clothing brands have held out on signing on to the accord and subsequent extensions. In 2021, an expanded international accord was developed to include more safety and worker health provisions beyond fire, electrical and structural inspections and repairs of factories. It covers garment factories in Pakistan as well as Bangladesh.The worker health and safety provisions include covering complaints of excessive overtime, lack of maternity leave, regular breaks, access to clean water and bathrooms, and workplace accidents such as heat exhaustion and injuries. It also provides a worker complaint mechanism where employees can confidentially report violations and bind signatories to supporting the complaint process.The garment sector accounts for 84% of Bangladesh’s exports, yet workers still face a dearth of safety protections. Photograph: Mustasinur Rahman Alvi/Eyepix Group/Rex/ShutterstockOver 170 fashion brands have signed on to the accord, including Adidas, American Eagle, Fruit of the Loom, H&amp;M, Zara, Hugo Boss, Puma, Primark, and PVH which owns the brands Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger.The US-based non-profit Remake, in partnership with the Sommilito Garments Sramik Federation, which represents 70,000 female garment workers in Bangladesh, the Labour Education Foundation in Pakistan, the US-based Service Employees International Union affiliate Workers United and Netherlands-based Clean Clothes Campaign, which includes 235 worker organizations, have formed a partnership to pressure Levi’s to sign on to the accord.Private auditing programs ... [have] not been effective.“The newly expanded international accord looks beyond building safety. So it is really a lifeline and a way for workers to share any wellbeing or workplace concerns,” said Ayesha Barenblat, founder and CEO of Remake.She explained workers had singled out Levi’s due to its sizable presence in Pakistan and Bangladesh, which has more than 20 factories. “We abjectly push back on the alleged effectiveness of Levi’s own safety program. The reason being that garment workers themselves have said – through Covid-19 [and] against the backdrop of the economic slowdown – their lives, and their wellbeing have simply been threatened and they do not have a direct line to the brands,” Barenblat said.She added: “The accord gives workers an equal seat at the table. Private auditing programs do not do that and they have simply, in the last 30 years, not been effective.”Bangladeshi garment workers complain about inadequate safety measures and a lack of access to water and medical care. Photograph: Mustasinur Rahman Alvi/Eyepix Group/Rex/ShutterstockAs part of the campaign, activists have delivered letters, sent hundreds of emails to the Levi’s board of directors, and held actions at Levi’s stores earlier this month in Chicago, Philadelphia, Washington DC, London, Delhi, Bengaluru, Dhaka and several other cities.In testimonies provided anonymously for fear of retaliation, workers in Bangladesh who make clothing for Levi’s raised issues such as heat exhaustion, abuse from managers and forced overtime.“We do not have much in terms of safety measures. We are not given machine guards. We do not have access to clean or cold water. It is so hot but we still have to drink hot water. People often faint due to the heat. We have no access to medical care,” said a machine operator who makes clothing for Levi’s and other brands.They added: “We are made to work forced overtime. If there is no overtime available we are forced to work from one to one and a half hours unpaid. Our supervisors and managers treat us very badly. They verbally assault us. If we protest or push back, we are told we will be fired.”The groups have also accused Levi’s of free-riding off the accord by using factories that are covered under the accord without signing on to it, as brands compensate for the safety inspections and oversight of the factories through the accord.Levi’s denied and disputed all complaints from the campaign and allegations of worker safety and health issues, citing several internal programs and efforts. A Levi’s spokesperson characterized the campaign as a social media engagement ploy.A spokesperson for Levi’s said in an email: “We agree with the intent and the spirit of the international accord and applaud the progress it has made. But it is not the only way to support workers in Bangladesh or anywhere else. We believe our programs, with their checks and balances, help us go further and give us greater agility to implement new learnings and expand our systems in other countries (which we are actively doing).”They added: “Recognizing that there is always room for improvement, we continue to augment and expand our programs, and when we hear of facilities that are not where they should be or workers reporting grievances, we investigate those instances, mandate that our suppliers address any issues that are found, and track their progress closely to ensure compliance.”</Text></Article><Article paper="guardian" author="[{'name': 'Denis Campbell Health policy editor'}]"><Text>Thérèse Coffey is ditching the government’s long-promised white paper on health inequalities, despite the 19-year gap in life expectancy between rich and poor, the Guardian has been told.The health secretary has decided to not publish a document that was due to set out plans to address the stark inequalities in health that the Covid-19 pandemic exposed.It was meant to appear by last spring and be a key part of then prime minister Boris Johnson’s declared mission to level up Britain. It was due to set out “bold action” to narrow the wide inequalities in health outcomes that exist between deprived and well-off areas, between white and BAME populations, and between the north and south of England.“It’s dead. It’s never going to appear. The white paper is being canned,” said one source familiar with the situation.A second source with knowledge of Coffey’s intentions said: “The disparities paper is toast. My understanding of why they’ve pulled it is [that it’s] ideological — the white paper is an affront to this government’s view of what makes for health.”Health experts reacted with dismay to the white paper being scrapped. “We expect the government to keep its commitment to addressing health disparities in an upcoming white paper and would have grave concerns if this long-planned paper were delayed or shelved,” said Dr Habib Naqvi, director of the NHS Race and Health Observatory.“We need to see priorities and an action plan set out to address a number of serious and longstanding health inequalities. This should be a priority, particularly given the cost of living crisis and the impact this is having on diverse communities.”Coffey’s decision follows the Truss government’s decision to review, with a view to scrapping, existing and planned measures to tackle the obesity crisis, such as banning buy-one-get-one-free offers and adverts for junk food being shown on TV before 9pm. That plan has sparked a huge backlash, with ex-Conservative leader William Hague, dozens of health organisations and 26 former health ministers all publicly criticising it as unwise and dangerous.Sajid Javid, the then health secretary, told MPs on 2 February that he would publish “in spring 2022” a white paper on “health disparities”. It would tackle “unacceptable disparities in health outcomes” and help to “break the link between people’s background and their prospect for a healthy life”.However, almost eight months on, it has still not appeared. Coffey’s Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) has no plans to publish it, contradicting repeated pledges by Javid that it would do so. In May he said it would appear “shortly” and would address problems that have been “neglected for too long”, such as the shortage of GPs working in poor areas.In June he said the white paper was an important part of his “vision for the year ahead”. However, he and then chancellor Rishi Sunak resigned from the cabinet on 5 July, in a move that set in train a series of events that led to Boris Johnson resigning as prime minister and being succeeded by Liz Truss, who has also made Coffey deputy prime minister.Sign up to First ThingFree daily newsletterStart the day with the top stories from the US, plus the day’s must-reads from across the GuardianPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, it was a notable omission in Coffey’s new 14-page Our Plan for Patients plan to improve the NHS, which she unveiled last week.“Health is inextricably linked to income, housing, education, employment and our environment, and while these issues can all be partly tackled through local interventions, we need sustained national policy action that is joined up across all government departments to really level up Britain’s health,” said Jim McManus, president of the Association of Directors of Public Health.William Roberts, the chief executive of the Royal Society for Public Health, said: “It is incredibly disappointing to hear that the disparities white paper is being scrapped. This was a clear opportunity to tackle the vast inequalities and disparities that we currently face. Disparities have continued to increase over the last two years and are only set worsen with the cost-of-living crisis. To address this now is essential if we are to build back the nation’s health and wealth to help rebuild our economy.” The DHSC has been approached for comment.</Text></Article><Article paper="guardian" author="[{'name': 'Ian Sample Science editor'}]"><Text>Vaping is substantially less harmful than smoking, according to a major review of nicotine products, but action is needed to tackle the sharp rise in e-cigarette use among children.Researchers at King’s College London said smokers who switched to vaping would experience a “substantial reduction” in their exposure to toxic substances that cause cancer, lung and cardiovascular disease, but they strongly urged non-smokers not to take up either habit.Ann McNeill, a professor of tobacco addiction at King’s and lead author on the study, said smoking was “uniquely deadly”, killing half of all regular, long-term smokers, but that a survey in England found two-thirds of adult smokers were unaware vaping was less harmful.“Vaping poses only a small fraction of the risks of smoking in the short to medium term, however, this does not mean vaping is risk-free, particularly for people who have never smoked,” she said.‘When I see kids vaping, I warn them: that’s what killed my daughter’Read moreDr Debbie Robson, a co-author of the report, said helping people switch from smoking to vaping must become a government priority to achieve the goal of a smoke-free England by 2030.The independent report, commissioned by the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities, in the Department of Health and Social Care, is the most comprehensive review of the health risks of vaping to date. The researchers drew on more than 400 published studies from around the world, many of which looked at signs of harm or levels of toxic substances in the body after smoking and vaping.Most studies reported short- or medium-term effects from smoking or vaping, such as raised levels of nicotine and specific cancer-causing compounds, meaning the scientists gained little insight into potentially more serious long-term health effects that arise after years of using the products.While two-thirds of adult smokers in England believe vaping is as harmful or more harmful than smoking, the report found that levels of toxic substances, such as nitrosamines, carbon monoxide and volatile organic compounds, were the same or lower in vapers compared with smokers. Levels were lower still in people who did not use any nicotine products.Among adults in England, smoking has fallen as vaping has increased, but the same trend is not playing out among younger people. According to the report, smoking among 11- to 18-year-olds stood at 6.3% in 2019 and 6% in 2022, while vaping rose from 4.8% to 8.6%. In the past year, rates of vaping have doubled among 16- to 18-year-olds, but the most striking rise was in newer, disposable vapes, which are now used by more than half of young vapers, up from 7.8% last year.It is illegal to sell vapes to under-18s, but secondary schools have reported a surge in vaping among pupils, largely driven by disposable vapes that can cost £5 each and come in flavours such as gummy bears, cotton candy, waffles and doughnut.The authors called for better law enforcement to prevent shopkeepers and other suppliers selling vapes to children, and for beefed up regulations to tackle the “dramatic increase” in young people using disposablevapes.Sign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterArchie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morningPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For those taking A-levels, these will be the first formal exams they sit. It is right that this is recognised and steps are taken to ensure the cohort is not disadvantaged as a result of their experiences.”National exams including A-levels, GCSEs and BTECs were abandoned by the government in 2020 and 2021, with grades awarded using a more generous system of local assessment that led to record levels of top grades.Jo Saxton, Ofqual’s chief regulator, said: “We expect that overall results in 2023 will be much closer to pre-pandemic years than results since 2020. This decision means that results in 2023 will be lower than in 2022.”The government had previously announced that grading would return to pre-pandemic levels through a two-year process, with exams in summer 2022 to be graded midway between those of 2019 and those assessed by teachers in 2021.But Saxton said senior examiners would make adjustments if next year’s exam performance was “a little lower” when compared with students who sat exams before the pandemic.“Broadly speaking … a typical student who would have achieved an A grade in their A-level geography before the pandemic will be just as likely to get an A next summer, even if their performance in the assessments is a little weaker in 2023 than it would have been before the pandemic,” Saxton said.Sign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterArchie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morningPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Fieldwork, non-exam assessment and science practicals have also been reinstated.The return to normality in the exam hall has been matched by a return to classrooms, according to new figures released by the DfE. The DfE’s survey of schools in England found that the national attendance rate was 95% for the week ending 12 September, back to the levels last seen before the pandemic outbreak.The figures will be a relief to MPs and policymakers, who feared that pandemic-related school closures had caused high levels of persistent absence and truancy.</Text></Article><Article paper="guardian" author="[{'name': 'Mark Brown North of England correspondent'}]"><Text>An immersive Matrix films-themed dance, music and visual effects experience directed by Danny Boyle is to be the opening production at one of Europe’s most anticipated cultural venues.The £186m Factory International in Manchester will, its supporters say, be like no other arts venue.Designed by Ellen van Loon, a partner at Rem Koolhaas’s Office for Metropolitan Architecture (OMA) practice, the Factory, which from one angle resembles a spaceship, has been built on the site of the former Granada television studios.It will have an industrial warehouse vibe to it, with super-sized movable walls allowing for different configurations, and everything from intimate performances to events on a grander, more eye-popping scale.The Boyle production will, they predict, be at the blockbuster end of things. It will feature “spectacular visual effects, a cast of professional dancers and hundreds of Manchester participants” coming together to recreate scenes from the Matrix films “provoking visions of an alternative future”.The Factory has been built on the site of the former Granada television studios.Boyle did not want to reveal too many details when talking about it on Thursday. But he did say: “You know what it’s like, especially at the moment, you think: what the fuck is going on? This is a project where we try to address that … through dance, really. That’s not giving too much away but it does reveal some of the ambition of it.”Boyle said community involvement was a key part of it but not in an “am-dram” way – it would be “pushing people to the highest level of performance”.The production is called Free Your Mind and will be the building’s official opening event in October 2023. It will feature choreography by Kenrick “H20” Sandy, music by Michael “Mikey J” Asante, stage sculptures by the designer Es Devlin and work by the poet and playwright Sabrina Mahfouz.It was in 2014 that details of a plan for a large-scale, “ultra-flexible” arts venue in Manchester first emerged. Supporters said it would combine the qualities of the London Coliseum and Tate Modern and would be like nowhere else.The then chancellor, George Osborne, pledged £78m towards its capital costs, revealing during his budget speech that it would be named after Tony Wilson’s Factory Records. “Anyone who is a child of the 80s will think that is a great idea,” he said.With money from Manchester city council and Arts Council England as well, the Factory is the largest investment in a UK cultural project since the opening of Tate Modern in 2000.The Factory will be programmed and operated by the Manchester international festival, and before the formal opening it will be part of the 2023 festival by staging a Yayoi Kusama show in July and August.Yayoi Kusama with her Dots Obsession at the Watari Museum of Contemporary Art in Tokyo.

Devlin said it felt like London’s Royal Festival Hall smashed into Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall.McGrath said he and his team were not daunted by having to programme so much new work, week in, week out, for such a large building. “We take artists on site quite a lot now,” he said. “I have never had an easier sell to artists in my life. Even people we had to work to get here, they were a bit reluctant. They walk in and they are like, ‘sign me up’. We could programme through to the end of the decade quite quickly.”McGrath estimates the venue will stage about 80 gigs a year. After Free Your Mind, there will be a nine-day programme of events – entitled The Welcome – developed by residents of Greater Manchester. It will be art, music, circus and fashion, with the possibility of spoken word poetry in the venue’s gender-neutral toilets.The director of Tate, Maria Balshaw, is among the Factory’s supporters. She said she had never seen a space like it. “I don’t know of another one in the world. It has been made with the audiences of the future as well as the art of the future in mind, she said. “I think art that none of us have ever encountered before is going to be made in Manchester.”The Factory is predicted to create or support as many as 1,500 direct and indirect jobs and add £1.1bn to the city’s economy over a decade. It is part of the regeneration of the St John’s area, along with new flats, offices and studios.It is OMA’s first major public building in the UK. Previous high-profile projects include the China Central Television Headquarters in Beijing, Seattle Central Library and the Garage contemporary art gallery in Gorky Park, Moscow.Van Loon, said the venue would be “a new type of performance space … a unique crossover between a fixed theatre and flexible warehouse”.She added: “I hope that whenever people come to the Factory they always experience something different, as if with each visit they encounter a different building.”</Text></Article><Article paper="guardian" author="[{'name': 'Ben Quinn'}]"><Text>Ministers “need to be honest with the public” that services will stop or be scaled back, the head of the union representing senior civil servants has said, amid fears a new era of austerity is about to be unleashed.Concern was expressed by trade unions representing public sector workers in response to reports that departments are being asked to draw up plans for cuts aimed at reducing government borrowing as a result of the crisis sparked by Kwasi Kwarteng’s mini-budget.Civil service departments were already delivering an average of 5% efficiency savings agreed as part of a review last year yet it now appeared the government was asking for those plans to be ripped up “in a state of panic”, said Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA union, which represents senior civil servants.‘A reverse Robin Hood’: key exchanges from Liz Truss’s radio interviewsRead more“If the government refuses to compensate public services for soaring inflation, or even cut their budgets back further, they need to be honest with the public,” he said. “Services are going to stop or be scaled back and the government needs to be accountable for those decisions.”The Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS), the largest representing civil servants in the UK, said that cuts “would make waiting lists longer for those seeking passports and driving licences, make telephone queues longer for those with tax enquiries”.The PCS general secretary, Mark Serwotka, added: “When a government minister says ‘efficiency savings’, everyone knows they mean ‘job cuts and privatisation’, and we’re very clear there’s no scope for either in the civil service.”Calling for a general election, Unison’s general secretary, Christina McAnea, said: “Ministers must listen to the world’s economic experts urging them to junk this disastrous financial experiment. Suggestions that benefits won’t rise with soaring inflation and beleaguered public services are to be squeezed is a terrifying prospect.“The government ​seems to have no idea of the damage its foolhardy approach is wreaking. Essential services need support and investment so they can hold on to experienced staff and deliver for the public, not cuts that will harm communities irreparably.”Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the ASCL was extremely concerned about the “bleak prospects” for the UK economy after the mini-budget. “There are many implications but one of the most worrying is that this will lead to a new era of austerity for public services, including education,” he said.“This comes after a decade in which school and college funding has significantly fallen in real-terms, forcing cutbacks in educational provision, because of the last age of austerity.”Another union representing civil servants, Prospect, called on Liz Truss to change course and stop what it described as an “irresponsible plan which is tanking the economy”.Mike Clancy, Prospect’s general secretary, said: “While ministers spent the entire summer fiddling as they picked a new PM, dedicated civil servants and other public sector workers kept the country running.”Truss promised during the Tory leadership election that she was “not planning public spending reductions”. But Sky News reported on Wednesday that the Treasury was expected to send out a letter to secretaries of state insisting that departments find savings.The union reaction came as the prime minister told BBC Radio Leeds that the government’s tax-cutting measures were the “right plan” in the face of rising energy bills and to get the economy growing and deal with inflation, despite market turmoil sparked by the chancellor’s mini-budget. </Text></Article><Article paper="guardian" author="[{'name': 'Associated Press'}]"><Text>US mortgage rates rose this week for the sixth straight week, marking new highs not seen in 15 years, before a crash in the housing market triggered the Great Recession.Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac reported on Thursday that the average on the key 30-year rate climbed to 6.7% from 6.29% last week. By contrast, the rate stood at 3.01% a year ago.The average rate on 15-year, fixed-rate mortgages, popular among those looking to refinance their homes, jumped to 5.96% from 5.44% last week.Rapidly rising mortgage rates threaten to sideline even more homebuyers after more than doubling in 2022. Last year, prospective homebuyers were looking at rates well below 3%.Freddie Mac noted that for a typical mortgage amount, a borrower who locked in at the higher end of the range of weekly rates over the past year would pay several hundred dollars more than a borrower who locked in at the lower end of the range.Last week, the Federal Reserve bumped up its benchmark borrowing rate by another three-quarters of a point in an effort to constrain the economy, its fifth increase this year and third consecutive 0.75 percentage point increase.Perhaps nowhere else is the effect of the Fed’s action more apparent than the housing sector. Existing home sales have been in decline for seven straight months as the rising cost to borrow money puts homes out of reach for more people.American dream of owning a home out of reach for many in tight marketsRead moreThe government reported on Thursday that the US economy, battered by surging consumer prices and rising interest rates, shrank at a 0.6% annual rate from April through June. That was unchanged from the previous estimate for the second quarter.Fed officials forecast that they will further raise their benchmark rate to roughly 4.4% by year’s end, a full point higher than they envisioned as recently as June. And they expect to raise the rate again next year, to about 4.6%. That would be the highest level since 2007.By raising borrowing rates, the Fed makes it costlier to take out a mortgage and an auto or business loan. Consumers and businesses then presumably borrow and spend less, cooling the economy and slowing inflation.</Text></Article><Article paper="guardian" author="[{'name': 'Edwin Rios'}]"><Text>The NAACP filed a federal complaint on Tuesday accusing Mississippi state officials of violating civil rights law by repeatedly diverting federal funds meant for ensuring safe drinking water away from the state’s predominantly – Black capital, Jackson, to smaller, white communities.Their actions amounted to racial discrimination and a devastating loss of access to drinking water for more than a month for residents in Jackson, where more than 80% of residents are Black and a quarter are in poverty.“The result is persistently unsafe and unreliable drinking water and massive gaps in the access to safe drinking water that are intolerable in any modern society,” Jackson residents allege in the complaint. “Nearly all of the residents of Jackson have watched brackish, dirty, impure, and undrinkable water trickle from their taps. At times, some have had no water at all.”The complaint, filed to the Environmental Protection Agency, amplifies pressure on officials in Mississippi and Jackson to address longstanding water infrastructure woes that recently forced Jackson to shut down its water supply in late August and maintain a boil water notice for weeks.Last week, a group of Jackson residents also filed a federal class-action lawsuit against current and former city and state officials as well as an engineering firm seeking monetary damages for neglect by officials.The NAACP’s complaint to the EPA, which has 25 days to decide whether to investigate it, notes that Jackson’s leaders have “repeatedly requested” aid from officials in the Republican-controlled state to “provide funding solutions”. Instead, “Jackson’s majority-Black population has been repeatedly ignored, spurned, or ridiculed,” the complaint states.In the last 25 years, the city has received federal funds toward addressing safe drinking water just three times. At the same time, since 2016, the city has imposed more than 750 notices for residents to boil their water, roughly 40% of which came in the last two years.Derrick Johnson, president of the NAACP and a Jackson resident, blamed “racist funding policies” by Governor Tate Reeves, a Republican, and state officials that prevented critical and preventive infrastructure from being built. Johnson described in the complaint how he and his family often used boiled and bottled water even when the city wasn’t under an advisory notice because he “cannot entrust his family’s health to the crumbling water system”.The city, where more than 80% of residents are Black and a quarter are in poverty, depends on federal funding in part because it has suffered from a shrinking tax base since white residents fled the area in the decade following the integration of public schools. Since Mississippi is one of 49 states where the EPA allows the state to decide how water systems are funded, it leaves the authority over whether those funds are equally distributed up to the state. The EPA’s inspector general announced in mid-September that it would investigate Jackson’s “drinking water emergency”, Politico reported.The complaint notes that state officials have exacerbated the funding gap by repeatedly denying Jackson the ability to fund improvements to its drinking water system. In March 2021, when, after a previous water shutdown, Jackson’s mayor, Chokwe Lumumba, requested $47m in emergency aid, and the state legislature approved just $3m .“The people of Jackson, Mississippi, have lacked access to safe and reliable water for decades,” the EPA administrator, Michael Regen, who visited the city on Monday and met with the city’s mayor, said in a statement. “These conditions are unacceptable in the United States of America.”In the past decade, such conditions have become part of the disparate plight of communities of color in other cities like Flint, Michigan, and Newark, New Jersey, where lead-ridden water has plagued ailing water infrastructure systems. Abre’ Conner, director of environmental and climate justice for the NAACP, said that the mishandling of Jackson’s water crisis is part of a “longstanding history of mistreating, and neglecting Black communities, putting the lives of men, women, and children at risk.“As our infrastructure continues to age and the effects of climate change worsen, we will continue to experience crises such as the one in Jackson, not only in Mississippi but in predominantly Black communities throughout the country,” she said in a statement.</Text></Article><Article paper="guardian" author="[{'name': 'Associated Press in Washington'}]"><Text>The conservative activist Ginni Thomas, the wife of the supreme court justice Clarence Thomas, appeared on Thursday for a voluntary interview with the House January 6 committee.Kushner camping tale one of many bizarre scenes in latest Trump bookRead moreThe committee had for months sought the interview in an effort to know more about Thomas’s role in trying to help Donald Trump overturn his election defeat by Joe Biden.She texted Trump’s White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, and contacted lawmakers in Arizona and Wisconsin in the weeks after the election.Thomas did not answer questions when she arrived for the interview or later when she briefly left for a break. But Thomas did tell reporters she was looking forward to answering questions from the members of the committee.Testimony from Thomas was one of the remaining items for the committee as it nears completion of its work. The panel has interviewed more than 1,000 witnesses and shown some testimony in eight public hearings.Thomas’s attorney, Mark Paoletta, said last week Thomas was “eager to answer the committee’s questions to clear up any misconceptions about her work relating to the 2020 election”.The extent of her involvement in the Capitol attack is unclear. In the days after the presidential election was called for Biden, Thomas emailed two lawmakers in Arizona to urge them to choose “a clean slate of electors” and “stand strong in the face of political and media pressure”.The AP obtained the emails earlier this year under the state’s open records law.Thomas has said in interviews she attended a pro-Trump rally near the White House on the morning of 6 January 2021 but left before Trump spoke and crowds attacked the Capitol.Thomas has repeatedly maintained that her political activities posed no conflict of interest with the work of her husband.“Like so many married couples, we share many of the same ideals, principles and aspirations for America,” Thomas told the Washington Free Beacon in March.“But we have our own separate careers and our own ideas and opinions too. Clarence doesn’t discuss his work with me and I don’t involve him in my work.”Justice Thomas was the lone dissenting voice when the supreme court ruled in January to allow a congressional committee access to presidential diaries, visitor logs, speech drafts and handwritten notes relating to the events of January 6.Ginni Thomas has been openly critical of the committee’s work, including signing a letter to House Republicans calling for the expulsion of Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, for joining the January 6 committee.</Text></Article><Article paper="guardian" author="[{'name': 'Richard Luscombe in Miami'}]"><Text>The “catastrophic” scale of damage wreaked by Hurricane Ian’s 150mph deadly rampage across Florida was beginning to emerge on Thursday as emergency crews rescued trapped residents from flooded homes, and authorities warned of the probability of numerous fatalities.Search and rescue crews moved in at first light to areas of south-west Florida that were submerged by a storm surge of up to 18ft after one of the most powerful storms ever to strike the US swept ashore on Wednesday.Storm Ian’s predicted track. Kevin Anderson, the mayor of Fort Myers, said he knew of “several” fatalities, but was unaware of their circumstances.In coastal south-west Florida, desperate residents posted to social media sites, pleading for rescue for themselves or loved ones. Helicopters assisted recovery efforts by coast guard and national guard troops.“Time is of the essence and we’ve got a lot of people we need to help,” Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor, said at a morning press conference.“They’re focusing their rescue efforts on those areas that were most hard hit.”Boats are partially submerged at a marina in the aftermath of Hurricane Ian in Fort Myers, Florida, on Thursday. Photograph: Giorgio Viera/AFP/Getty ImagesThe governor said Ian had caused widespread impacts across the state, with life-threatening flooding from the deluge of three months’ worth of rain in 48 hours in some areas.“The impacts of this storm are historic, and the damage that was done has been historic. And this is just off initial assessment,” he said.“This storm is having broad impacts across the state, and some of the flooding you’re going to see in areas hundreds of miles from where this made landfall are going to set records.”Joe Biden made a major disaster declaration for nine of the worst-affected counties, freeing federal resources to supplement local rescue and recovery efforts, and guaranteeing government money for an initial 30-day period for costs likely to run into billions of dollars.As Ian weakened into a tropical storm and prepared to exit Florida’s east coast on Thursday, more than 2 million people in the state remained without power, and could be for weeks, DeSantis said, adding that power grids would need to be completely rebuilt in some areas.Residents from Punta Gorda on the south-west coast to Orlando and Cape Canaveral assessed the damage from unprecedented flooding and the storm’s punishing winds.“I don’t think that we can quantify it yet. But I can tell you that it is going to be catastrophic,” said Deanne Criswell, administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), to CNN.“The amount of impact to these communities is going to be significant. When we look at these large population centers that have had significant impacts to their homes, we know a number of these families are living in mobile homes, which have a very hard time with standing storms as strong as Ian.“We are preparing for the potential of thousands of families that are going to need assistance as they assess their own damage and get on their road to recovery.”A section of the causeway leading to Sanibel, Florida in Lee county was knocked out by Hurricane Ian on Thursday.

Sheriff Carmine Marceno walked back his earlier claim of “hundreds”, but said he feared what rescue crews would find.“There are people I know did not evacuate,” he told CNN. “They tried to take cover, they’ve gone to the second floor and the attic [but] the water got so high here with a surge of approximately 16ft give or take, that’s what’s going to compromise structures and also that’s the most deadly.”Anderson, the Fort Myers mayor, said rescue operations were ongoing and it was too soon for an accurate figure. “I just know there are several deaths related to the storm,” he said.In Deltona, a 72-year-old man fell into a canal while using a hose to drain his pool in heavy rain and drowned, the Volusia county sheriff’s office said.The storm surge flooded the lower-level emergency room of the HCA Florida Fawcett hospital in Port Charlotte, while fierce winds tore part of the fourth-floor roof from its intensive care unit, according to Dr Birgit Bodine.Intensive care staff were forced to evacuate the medium-sized hospital’s sickest patients to other floors.Bodine said incoming storm injuries could make things worse. “The ambulances may be coming soon and we don’t know where to put them in the hospital at this point,” she said. “We’re doubled and tripled up.”Elsewhere, a 65ft section of a causeway connecting mainland Fort Myers to Sanibel and Captiva islands collapsed.“We are beginning to get a sense that our community has been, in some respects, decimated,” said the Lee county manager, Roger Desjarlais.Meanwhile, the governors of Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia declared states of emergency as they prepared for the probability of Ian restrengthening before making a second landfall.The National Hurricane Center in Miami predicted on Thursday that its path would take it into the Atlantic later today and curve back towards the south-east US coast by Friday afternoon as a strong tropical storm or possible hurricane.“Widespread, life-threatening catastrophic flooding, with major to record river flooding, will continue today across portions of central Florida with considerable flooding in northern Florida, south-eastern Georgia and eastern South Carolina through the end of the week,” the NHC said in its morning advisory.The Associated Press contributed to this report</Text></Article><Article paper="guardian" author="[{'name': 'Denis Campbell Health policy editor'}]"><Text>Multiple failures by the NHS 111 telephone advice service early in the pandemic left Covid patients struggling to get care and led directly to some people dying, an investigation has found.The Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch (HSIB) looked into the help that NHS 111 gave people with Covid in the weeks before and after the UK entered its first lockdown on 23 March 2020.It identified a series of weaknesses with the helpline, including misjudgment of how seriously ill some people with Covid were, a failure to tell some people to seek urgent help, and a lack of capacity to deal with a sudden spike in calls.It also raised concerns that the government’s advice to citizens to “stay at home” to protect NHS services deterred people who needed immediate medical attention from seeking it from GPs and hospitals, sometimes with fatal consequences.HSIB’s investigation was prompted by a series of reports in the Guardian in 2020 about inadequacies in how 111 operated in the initial weeks of the pandemic, and claims by the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice that many callers with Covid received inadequate advice and died after being wrongly told to stay at home.HSIB’s 15-month investigation uncovered an array of flaws, including some key failings involving the Coronavirus Response Service (CRS), a telephone triage service set up on 5 March 2020 to which 111 call handlers were to transfer queries from anyone concerned about the virus.Mistakes identified by HSIB included that: The CRS algorithm did not allow for the assessment of any life-threatening illness a caller had – such as obesity, cancer or lung disease – to establish if they should undergo a clinical assessment. When “many” callers reached the core 111 service, there was no way to divert them as intended to the CRS, which was operationally independent of 111. Although patients who had symptoms of Covid-19 as well underlying health conditions, including diabetes, were meant to be assessed when they spoke to the core 111 service, “some” were not. The number of extra calls to 111 in March 2020 meant only half were answered. To illustrate its findings, HSIB published four short anonymised accounts provided to them by the families of deceased Covid patients’ families about their experience of 111 early in the pandemic. All four were advised to stay at home, did not receive in-person medical help until they were gravely ill, and later died. In one case, calls from a sick man and his relatives went unanswered. In another, a man – a 45-year-old doctor – was misdiagnosed as having a chest infection, prescribed an inhaler and antibiotics, and died 16 days after being admitted to hospital.Of the advice to “stay at home” and call 111, which was widely promoted at the time, HSIB concluded: “The decision to redirect the public to call NHS 111 rather than access healthcare advice in other ways, for example through their GP, shifted the immediate burden of managing patients with Covid-19 in the community. This increased capacity, in the wider healthcare system, but risked disrupting continuity of care for patients with complex health needs.”The Department of Health and Social Care declined to comment on that advice.Rachel Power, the chief executive of the Patients Association, said: “While we appreciate that NHS 111 was working under new and very challenging circumstances, and knowledge of the effects of Covid-19 was in its infancy, the report … supports our own calls for the NHS to improve and standardise the level of service provided by NHS 111 across the country.”Its own research in 2021 found that some 111 users “felt badly let down” by it, she added.NHS England highlighted the “vital role” NHS 111 had played in the response to Covid, fielding 2m calls in March 2020 alone and referring more than 500,000 people for assessment.A spokesperson said: “Call handlers followed guidance set out by Public Health England, which was regularly updated as the understanding of Covid-19 improved, and the NHS has captured learning throughout the last two years to contribute to the response to any future pandemics.”</Text></Article><Article paper="guardian" author="[{'name': 'Patrick Butler, Social policy editor'}]"><Text>Poverty campaigners have said it would be “morally indefensible” for ministers to fund tax cuts for the richest on the backs of the poor, amid speculation ministers may reduce welfare benefits in the wake of last week’s ill-received fiscal statement.Friday’s mini-budget announced billions of tax cuts benefiting high earners, but the subsequent market fallout plunged the UK’s finances to near crisis. The government is expected to have to make tens of billions of pounds of public spending cuts later this year to try to put the UK’s finances on a sound footing.With prime minister Liz Truss having made high-profile political commitments to increase defence and NHS spending, welfare is seen as a prime candidate for cuts.‘A reverse Robin Hood’: key exchanges from Liz Truss’s radio interviewsRead moreIn interviews on Thursday morning the Treasury minister Chris Philp refused to confirm the government would stick to promises made in May by former chancellor Rishi Sunak that benefits would be uprated by the September rate of inflation.Raising benefit rates next April by less than the September rate of CPI inflation – likely to be about 10% – would save billions for the Treasury but would be likely to increase poverty and hardship for low-income families already struggling with the cost of living crisis.The Resolution Foundation thinktank estimated raising benefits in line with earnings – about 5% – rather than inflation would save the government £11bn next year but would leave a couple with two children more than £1,061 a year worse off, and a single parent with one child £607 a year out of pocket.Any cuts would follow a year in which benefits were uprated in April by 3.1% – linked to the September 2021 inflation rate – despite inflation having soared to about 9%. This resulted in the biggest fall in the real value of the basic rate of unemployment benefits in 50 years.“Many people across the UK will agree it is morally indefensible that the prime minister would choose to give tax cuts to the richest funded on the backs of the poorest in our society,” said Iain Porter, senior policy adviser at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation charity.Child Poverty Action Group chief executive Alison Garnham said: “Struggling families will not forgive a chancellor who comes to them for efficiency savings when their cupboards are already bare.”Philippa Stroud, a Tory peer and head of the Legatum Institute thinktank, said hard policy choices made by the government should not be taken on the backs of the poorest. “This is a matter of basic human dignity. We have to take care of the most vulnerable at times of bumpy transitions in society. This is what government exists to do,” she told the Guardian.Sign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterArchie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morningPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Liz Truss’s claims on financial chaos fact-checkedRead moreLegatum estimates that despite energy price caps, 1.5 million additional people in the UK will be pushed into relative poverty this winter, bringing the total to 15.5 million. Real terms cuts to benefits would probably further drive up poverty rates that are already at their highest level this century.James Taylor, director of strategy at disability equality charity Scope, said: “If the government u-turns on this promise, it would be devastating and lead to disabled people starving and freezing in their own homes.”Governments are legally obliged to annually raise some disability benefits in line with prices, but have far more discretion when it comes to working-age benefits such as universal credit. The convention is to raise these in line with CPI inflation, but this is often flouted, for example when the government froze benefits for four years in 2016.A Department for Work and Pensions spokesperson said: “The secretary of state commences her statutory annual review of benefits and state pensions in the autumn using the most recent prices and earnings indices available.”</Text></Article><Article paper="guardian" author="[{'name': 'Nyasha Chingonoin Harare'}]"><Text>Renowned Zimbabwean author Tsitsi Dangarembga has been given a suspended prison sentence after being found guilty of inciting violence by staging a peaceful protest calling for political reform.Dangarembga and co-accused Julie Barnes were convicted of participating in a public gathering with intent to incite public violence at Harare magistrates court on Thursday. The pair were also each fined 70,000 Zimbabwe dollars (£200).A six-month jail term was suspended for the next five years on condition that the two do not commit a similar offence.Dangarembga was arrested in July 2020 for holding a placard inscribed “We want better. Reform our institutions” during a peaceful protest. Human rights organisations including Amnesty and the writers’ association PEN International had called for the charges to be dropped. PEN swiftly condemned the conviction on Thursday and called on the Zimbabwe authorities “to uphold their human rights obligations and desist from persecuting dissenting voices”.The magistrate, Barbara Mateko, said the state had proved beyond doubt that the two had staged a demonstration with the intent to incite violence.Prize-winning Dangarembga protested against the court’s decision and said she will appeal at the high court.“We are in a situation where media freedom is not encouraged and those like myself and Julie, my co-accused, who wish to promote freedom of the media, are found to have committed a crime,” Dangarembga, who was shortlisted for Booker prize in 2020, told journalists outside court.“This means the space for freedom of expression is shrinking and is increasingly criminalised. However, we do intend to appeal the conviction.”She said freedom of expression was under siege in Zimbabwe.“Our role as citizens is being changed into a role that is not an active citizen but a subject. And we are not a monarchy as far as I know,” Dangarembga said.The 63-year-old’s first novel, Nervous Conditions, won the African section of the Commonwealth Writers’ Prize in 1989. Her book This Mournable Body was nominated for a Booker prize in 2020.Dangarembga was arrested amid a sweeping crackdown by security agencies on human rights campaigners that included the arrest of investigative journalist Hopewell Chin’ono.On Twitter, Chin’ono described the ruling against Dangarembga as “one of the biggest blunders ever made by [president Emmerson] Mnangagwa’s repressive regime, they might not care, but they will regret it. It has put a magnificent global spotlight back on Zimbabwe, something Zimbabwe needed.”Dangarembga has been a fierce critic of president Emmerson Mnangagwa’s government, which has been accused of corruption and human rights violations.As Zimbabwe faces a decisive presidential poll next year, there are growing fears that freedom of expression could be curtailed.</Text></Article><Article paper="guardian" author="[{'name': 'Gloria Oladipo in New York'}]"><Text>Eighteen people are missing after a boat carrying Cuban migrants sank off Florida due to Hurricane Ian, further underlining the human cost of the storm.Hurricane Ian: more than 2m without power as Florida hit with ‘catastrophic’ wind and rainRead moreUS border patrol said on Wednesday that it responded to a migrant landing in Stock Island, in the lower Florida Keys, Reuters said.Four people swam to shore after their vessel sank, hours before the hurricane made landfall in Florida.Three more people were rescued in the water and taken to hospital with heat exhaustion and dehydration symptoms, the US coast guard said.A search and rescue effort led by the coast guard is under way. Authorities said on Thursday that they have rescued a total of nine people who were on the capsized boat, the US coast guard tweeted.On Tuesday, seven people also from Cuba were taken into custody after making it to shore in Pompano Beach, Florida, just north of Fort Lauderdale, CBS News said.Officials used social media to issue a warning about making the dangerous journey by sea, even after Hurricane Ian passes.“Do not risk your life by attempting this journey at sea. Storm surge along with King tide can create treacherous sea conditions even after a storm passes,” they said.Hurricane Ian battered Cuba, killing at least two people and leaving much of the island in total blackout. Millions were already facing daily power interruptions.After making landfall in Florida, one of the most intense storms to make landfall in the US has continued to wreak havoc on hospitals and other essential infrastructure.A hospital in Port Charlotte, Florida, an hour outside Venice, experienced major flooding in its lower-level emergency room and had the roof of its intensive care unit torn off, the Associated Press reported.Medical staff at HCA Florida Fawcett worked quickly on Wednesday to move its most vulnerable patients to other floors, as water flooded the hospital from above and below.The hospital has four floors. Only two remained usable.Dr Birgit Bodine, who was there when the roof came off, said patients had been mostly understanding amid damage from the storm but staff were worried about the potential influx of patients with storm-related injuries.“The ambulances may be coming soon and we don’t know where to put them in the hospital at this point,” Bodine said, noting that patients were “doubled or tripled up” given the lack of space.Bodine added: “For us, as much as everything is terrible and we’re exhausted … as long as our patients do OK and nobody ends up dying or having a bad outcome, that’s what matters.’</Text></Article><Article paper="guardian" author="[{'name': 'Tess McClure in Auckland'}]"><Text>In nearly six months, just 36 people have taken up New Zealand’s offer to resettle refugees held in Australian detention camps such as Nauru, with UN’s refugee agency saying the brutality of Australia’s immigration regime is partly to blame.In March 2022, Australia’s government accepted a longstanding offer from New Zealand to resettle up to 450 refugees from Australia’s regional processing centres over the next three years, at a rate of up to 150 per year. But after nearly six months, uptake has been slow – stymied by the dire mental health of prospective applicants.The UN and NZ Greens say many refugees are so traumatised by their years in prison camps that they lack capacity to apply, or have lost trust in the asylum process.Refugees resettled in New Zealand from Australia to be permanently banned from returningRead moreIn theory, more than 1,200 people could have applied – about 110 refugees and asylum seekers on Nauru, and around 1,100 temporarily brought to Australia. So far, however, 36 people have been submitted by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for resettlement to New Zealand under this arrangement, and, according to the New Zealand government, only 14 have been interviewed.“The mental health impact of what these individuals have experienced over the past nine years has significantly affected their capacity to engage in the resettlement process and has led to a general lack of confidence in the processes,” said Emily Chipman, at the UNHCR for Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific. “Refugees have evoked concerns about leaving family members behind in Australia, and about not being psychologically strong enough to rebuild their lives in a new country after all they have gone through over the past nine years.”Chipman said that of more than 1,100 refugees being held in Australia, less than 14% had expressed interest in resettling in New Zealand. Those still awaiting outcomes on their applications to other countries – such as the US and Canada – cannot be referred to New Zealand. Because of that, less than 9% of those in Nauru are currently eligible.New Zealand immigration minister Michael Wood told reporters on Thursday the low numbers came as fewer people than expected self-nominated to settle in New Zealand. “There’s nothing that we can do to force the people concerned to pursue this pathway,” he said.“The people themselves need to positively identify themselves that they wish to pursue the option of attempting settlement in New Zealand – and so that’s where those numbers come from. That’s the number of people who have identified that option.”Wood said he had “had a number of productive discussions with home affairs minister Clare O’Neil in Australia, who has oversight of the deal from the Australian government’s end, and I think they’re very positively engaged in the process,” he said.The New Zealand Greens refugee spokesperson, MP Golriz Ghahraman, said the delays were partly because many of the refugees concerned are highly traumatised, suffering from major mental health issues, with some sceptical that the offer was real and would not be withdrawn.“There’s a whole lot of people who are really hard to process because of the very severe mental health harms,” Ghahraman said she was told in meetings with UNHCR officials. “They are struggling to get information out of them, or get them to even want to apply,” she said.Home affairs minister Claire O’Neil has been contacted for comment on the reasons for the limited uptake.Ghahraman added that many of the refugees had experienced years of conditions that amounted to torture, citing examples like the case of a 12-year old who was finally evacuated to Australia in a critical condition after refusing all food and medical treatment for more than 20 days. A Médecins Sans Frontières report in 2018 found almost a third of Nauru asylum seeker and refugee patients had attempted suicide, 60% had suicidal thoughts, and 12 patients were diagnosed with the rare disorder resignation syndrome, where they became nonverbal and catatonic.Ghahraman said: “Before people are able to engage with the refugee determination process, they need a high level of mental health care and support, and that should be actively resourced – probably by Australia. Because Australia is the one that’s caused that harm.”Others had already put in applications to resettle to Canada or the US, and were concerned about losing their place on those waitlists if they applied to New Zealand, she said.Of the refugees being processed to check their eligibility for New Zealand’s offer, 16 are in Nauru, of whom 14 have been interviewed . New Zealand is in the process of making immigration decisions for them. The other 16 are in Australia, and have not yet been interviewed to check their eligibility because they have only recently been entered into the process by the UNHCR.Elizabeth Young, an advocate for the Asia Pacific Refugee Rights Network (APRRN), said while she would anticipate the resettlement process could be lengthy, it was “remarkable” that such a small number had been signed up to begin the process. “Why is it taking so long, and what is being done to ostensibly promote this as a good option for people … are people being appropriately supported to apply?”</Text></Article><Article paper="guardian" author="[{'name': 'Eva Corlett in Wellington'}]"><Text>A New Zealand health campaign designed to help curb hepatitis C has hit a stumbling block after one of its advertisements showing people raising the middle finger was deemed too offensive to air.The associate health minister, Ayesha Verrall, launched the “Stick it to Hep C” campaign in July, to raise awareness over the virus, which kills roughly 200 New Zealanders a year.The campaign included videos, outdoor posters and online material featuring actors raising their middle finger to another person, while smiling.

It’s far too important to be tainted and diminished by prejudice and harassment,” Plibersek said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The report into equity, inclusion and diversity in the Australian Antarctic Program, led by AAD senior adviser and University of Tasmania researcher, Assoc Prof Meredith Nash, published allegations of gender inequality and inappropriate behaviour at stations in Antarctica. Nash’s investigation included reports of unwelcome requests for sex, uninvited physical contact or gestures, displays of offensive or pornographic material, sexist jokes, inappropriate drinking culture, and a homophobic culture on stations.The AAD manages four permanent research stations in Antarctica and the sub-Antarctic. It describes each location as running “like small towns”, with the number of people deployed to each location varying between dozens and more than 100, depending on the time of year, deployed for several months at a time.The Nash inquiry, first reported by the ABC on Friday, made particular note of women in the program being forced to “go to great lengths to make their menstruation invisible”, including “absent or inadequate” support. Reports included women being forced to change menstrual products without privacy or adequate sanitation, having to carry used products in the field with them, improvising menstrual products when no fresh supplies were available, and keeping products in their bodies for longer than recommended due to inadequate toilet stops.It also spoke of “everyday sexism” being “evident in the artefacts on the walls”, a “predatory and objectifying” culture, and “widespread, low-level sexual harassment that permeates stations”.The full report ran to 32 pages, but Plibersek’s office would only publicly release a seven-page summary, citing privacy concerns.Nash recommended widespread action to address gender inequality, including more regular surveys about station culture, diversifying application pools to attract a wider variety of staff, and major reforms to internal culture such as providing free menstrual products, better health training, training around sexual harassment and complaints, and “a major outreach effort to address sexual harassment”.The secretary of the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water, David Fredericks, said in a statement that the report’s findings were unacceptable.“The study by Professor Nash found that women reported experiencing sexual harassment and feeling excluded and diminished while undertaking work in the Australian Antarctic Program, particularly while stationed in the Antarctic,” he wrote.“The report also finds that gender inequality and a broader lack of diversity in AAD are contributing factors.

Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In a judgment handed down on Friday, the court ruled the Northern Territory Aboriginal Sacred Sites Act 1989 did not apply to the director of Parks Australia.The court found an offence within a sacred site could be defended on the basis it was carried out in line with their duties under the federal government or the crown.It also found the director of Parks Australia has “the same legal status as the executive government of the commonwealth in relation to the imposition of criminal liability”, and is generally exempt from prosecution.The director carried out the track realignment works without any certificates, which are required under the Sacred Sites Act, but has since received the approvals.Joe Markham, a traditional owner of the site, told Guardian Australia the decision was “disappointing” and said traditional owners felt “voiceless”.“It’s basically saying that it’s OK to desecrate one of our churches or sacred sites and that there’s nothing to stop them in the future, or anybody else for that matter,” Markham said.“This could have been a mosque or a church … We’ve been done wrong. We didn’t get to tell our story it just came down to a legal matter.”Markham said the area that was within the tracks is extremely significant to the local Jawoyn people as a sacred ceremonial men’s site.“It means [it is an] initiation site for the Jawoyn people and resides on what is the oldest living religion on planet Earth. It’s a focal point for one of our ceremonies,” Markham said.Sophie Creighton, the director of research and land information at the Aboriginal Areas Protection Authority, said the decision was a blow for Aboriginal land rights and cultural protection standards around the country.“We can’t have a situation where there’s uncertainty about whether Aboriginal voices will be listened to when they’re seeking to protect cultural heritage on behalf of all Australians,” Creighton said.Sign up to Guardian Australia's Morning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing email breaks down the key national and international stories of the day and why they matterPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On Friday the Russian president is expected to sign into law the annexations of four Ukrainian regions – Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk and Luhansk – where Russia held fake referendums over the past week in order to claim a mandate for the territorial claims. Thursday night’s decrees, made public by the Kremlin, said Putin had recognised Kherson and Zaporizhzhia as independent territories. This is an intermediary step needed before Putin can go ahead with plans to declare on Friday that they are part of Russia. The UN secretary general has warned Russia that annexing Ukrainian regions would mark a “dangerous escalation” that would jeopardise the prospects for peace in the region. António Guterres said any decision to proceed with the annexation of the Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions “would have no legal value and deserves to be condemned”. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, warned of a “very harsh” response by Ukraine if Russia went ahead with the annexations. There are indications that Russia might limit the movement of Ukrainians living in the occupied territories after it announces their annexation. Ukrainians have been told that from Saturday they will need to apply for a pass from the occupying authorities. This comes as the exiled Luhansk regional governor, Serhiy Haidai, said Russia had prevented about 1,000 Ukrainians from crossing the border into Latvia. Russian forces may face “imminent defeat” in the key north-eastern city of Lyman as Ukrainian soldiers continue their counteroffensive in the east of the country, according to a US thinktank. The Institute for the Study of War, citing Russian reports, said the defeat would allow Ukrainian troops to “threaten Russian positions along the western Luhansk” region. Alexander Petrikin, the pro-Russian head of the city administration, admitted the situation had grown “difficult” for Russian forces trying to hold the territory. Ukrainian forces have secured all of Kupiansk and driven Russian troops from their remaining positions on the east bank of the river that divides the north-eastern Ukrainian city. Most of Kupiansk, a strategic railway junction, was recaptured earlier this month as part of a counteroffensive by Ukrainian troops. AFP reported that those Russian troops who held out on the east bank of the Oskil river have been driven out. Finland is closing its border to Russian tourists after Putin’s partial mobilisation order prompted large numbers of people to flee the country. From midnight Thursday Finnish time (9pm GMT), Russian tourists holding an EU Schengen visa will be turned away unless they have a family tie or a compelling reason to travel. More than half of Russians felt fearful or anxious after Putin’s mobilisation announcement, according to a new poll. The poll by the independent Levada Centre showed 47% of respondents said they had felt anxiety, fear or dread after hearing that hundreds of thousands of soldiers would be drafted to fight in Ukraine. Nato vowed a “determined response” to what it described as “deliberate, reckless and irresponsible acts of sabotage” after leaks were discovered in the two Nord Stream pipelines. Swedish authorities have reported a fourth leak on one of the pipelines. The two leaks in Swedish waters were close to each other. Gas is likely to stop leaking from the damaged Nord Stream 1 pipeline on Monday, according to the pipeline’s operator. A spokesperson for Nord Stream AG said it was not possible to provide any forecasts for the pipeline’s future operation until the damage had been assessed. The Kremlin has said incidents on the Nord Stream pipelines look like an “act of terrorism”. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said a foreign state was probably responsible. Russia’s foreign ministry claimed the “incident on the Nord Stream occurred in a zone controlled by American intelligence”. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, announced an eighth package of sanctions – including a draft sanctions law seen by the Guardian – designed to “make the Kremlin pay” for the escalation of the war against Ukraine. Hungary “cannot and will not support” energy sanctions in the package, said Gergely Gulyas, chief of staff to the prime minister, Viktor Orbán. An EU official said an agreement on the next sanctions package was expected before next week’s EU summit, or at least major parts of the package. Russia is escalating its use of Iranian-supplied “kamikaze” drones in southern Ukraine, including against the southern port of Odesa and the nearby city of Mykolaiv. Oleg Deripaska, one of Russia’s most powerful oligarchs, has been indicted by the US Department of Justice for criminal sanctions violations. Deripaska previously had deep links to British establishment figures. </Text></Article><Article paper="guardian" author="[{'name': 'Jasper Jolly'}]"><Text>Partners at Deloitte in the UK and Switzerland will receive an average income of more than £1m each for the second year in a row, after the accountancy firm enjoyed another successful year.Each partner will receive an average distributable profit of £1,058,000 in the year to the end of May, about 33 times the UK’s average annual pay. This is the first time the sum has exceeded £1m and is an increase of about 24% compared with the same period the year before.Equity partners do not receive a salary but instead receive a share of profits as income, with 672 of them sharing £711m in profits in the 2022 financial year.While the average distributable profit rose, the total payout they received was flat year on year because the 2021 results were flattered by a £196,000 windfall for each partner after the sale of Deloitte’s UK restructuring business to Teneo, an advisory firm.The big four accountancy firms – Deloitte, EY, KPMG and PwC – benefited from an increase in business in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic as companies made a wave of mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) and looked to introduce newer technology.Deloitte, which has 20,000 UK employees, said “resilient markets and corporate investment” had driven revenues up in the combined UK and Switzerland by 10% to £4.9bn during the financial year, with business growing in all areas. Revenues grew fastest, up 15% year on year, in the consulting division, which advises businesses on changes such as new technology.However, Deloitte has not escaped scandal. In April the UK’s accounting regulator, the Financial Reporting Council, said it was investigating Deloitte over its audit of the bus and rail operator Go-Ahead over wrongly withholding £50m of taxpayers’ money. The regulator is also investigating Deloitte’s audits of the motoring group Lookers and building materials company SIG.Other big accountancy firms have also enjoyed rapid growth in the past year. Last week EY reported that global revenues rose by almost 14% in the year to June. PwC partners also received an average payout of more than £1m in the same period – albeit one flattered by the sale of another business.The post-pandemic M&amp;A boom has waned dramatically over the course of 2022, with global deals so far worth a third of what they were in 2021 as businesses brace for a possible global recession, according to Dealogic, a data company.Nevertheless, accountancy firms are still looking at growth areas such as increased demand for sustainability reporting, as well as the continued introduction of digital technology.Sign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to the all the business news and analysis you need every morningPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Putin has said he is ready to defend those territories using all available means, indicating he would be willing to resort to a nuclear strike in order to avert Ukraine’s efforts to liberate its sovereign territory. Putin is seen to be passing a point of no return that will prolong the war and scuttle even the remotest chance of negotiations by obliging Russia to fight in perpetuity for Ukrainian territory, some of which it does not currently control.Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Russia would be annexing itself to a “catastrophe” and vowed that Moscow would get no new territory. “We know how to react to any Russian actions,” the Ukrainian president said on the Telegram messaging app. The Russian government spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said the signing of the “treaties on the accession of territories into the Russian Federation” would take place at 3pm local time in the Kremlin’s St George’s Hall. Putin would deliver a “major” speech at the ceremony.The announcement set off a fresh round of international condemnation. “Any decision to proceed with the annexation of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions of Ukraine would have no legal value and deserves to be condemned,” the UN secretary general, António Guterres, told reporters.MapJoe Biden said that the US would never recognise Russia’s claims on Ukraine’s territory, and denounced the fake referendums as an “absolute sham,” saying, “The results were manufactured in Moscow.”“Putin is raising the stakes,” said Tatiana Stanovaya, a political analyst and founder of R.Politik. “It’s a demonstration that Russia is not ready to negotiate, not ready to make any concessions, and is ready to use any means at its disposal to achieve its strategic goals. Including nuclear weapons. The Russian leadership has said this directly without any hesitation.”‘I will defend the country’: while some Russians flee draft, others head to warRead moreThe territories were not named formally but Kremlin pool reporters said four treaties would be signed, corresponding to the four regions Russia has indicated it plans to annex.Putin is expected to make a speech to members of the State Duma, Russia’s lower house of parliament, at the ceremony.

He hopes that the threat of all-out war and a nuclear retaliation will reduce western support for the Ukrainian offensive.Ukraine and its supporters have decried Putin’s threats as “nuclear blackmail”. In remarks earlier this week, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, vowed to defend and free Ukrainians in the occupied territories.“This farce in the occupied territory cannot even be called an imitation of referendums,” Zelenskiy said on Tuesday in a video posted on Telegram. “We will act to protect our people: both in the Kherson region, in the Zaporizhzhia region, in the Donbas, in the currently occupied areas of the Kharkiv region, and in the Crimea.”Ukraine’s presidential office said Zelenskiy had spoken to his Polish counterpart, Andrzej Duda, on Thursday about the international reaction to Russia’s illegal referendums. “We discussed specific steps and measures that we will work on in this context, military and defence cooperation,” Zelenskiy wrote on Telegram.The two leaders “agreed on the need for a powerful consolidated world reaction to the illegal actions of the Russian Federation, which destroy the foundations of international law”, the statement from Zelenskiy’s office read. “Specific steps and measures that the parties will work on in this context were discussed.” Zelenskiy also had a call with the outgoing Italian prime minister, Mario Draghi, on Thursday afternoon. According to Zelenskiy’s office, the main topic of their discussion was the need for a firm reaction to the fake referendums.“They are worthless and do not change reality. The territorial integrity of Ukraine will be restored. And our reaction to Russia’s recognition of their results will be very harsh,” Zelenskiy said, according to the statement from his office.Zelenskiy also said he was convening an “urgent” meeting of the national security council on Friday, with details to be announced later. The Kremlin does not have full control over many of the territories it is seeking to annex. It is likely it will lay claim to all four Ukrainian regions in their entirety, including several mid-size cities that are not under Russian control. For instance, in the Zaporizhzhia region, local occupation officials claimed that the recent “referendum” included the entire region, including the city of Zaporizhzhia, which had a prewar population of 750,000. That would mean the Kremlin is obliging the country to fight in perpetuity to defend territories and make advances even while it is on the defensive on the battlefield.The Kremlin may only reveal the details of which territories it is claiming to annex during the signing ceremony. A state budget revealed on Thursday showed that Russia had earmarked 3.3bn roubles ($56.3m or £51.1m) to rebuild the regions. The damage to the city of Mariupol alone was estimated by its mayor at $14bn. The annexation will make the chance of a negotiated settlement to end the war even more remote. Russia amended its constitution in 2022 to forbid ceding territory the country has formally annexed.It was initially seen as a way to prevent a future Russian leader from ceding Crimea, which was annexed in 2014. But the law would also forbid Russia from ceding territories occupied since February or those not currently under Kremlin control.Ekaterina Schulmann, a Russian political scientist, wrote that after annexation, the “Russian Federation as we knew it will pass into a new phase of its existence, having become a state with a delegitimised border, including fragments that not only won’t be recognised by any state or international organisation de jure, but won’t be controlled by its central administration de facto”.</Text></Article><Article paper="guardian" author="[{'name': 'Jennifer Rankin and Pippa Crerar'}]"><Text>Liz Truss will attend the inaugural summit of the European Political Community (EPC) next week, an initiative by the EU aimed at uniting the continent to work together on security and other common projects.The prime minister plans to attend the first EPC summit in Prague on 6 October, a No 10 source told the Guardian, despite her scepticism about the EU-led initiative.Truss, a former remainer who became an ardent convert to Brexit, is said to still be sceptical, but willing to engage and keen to ensure the new organisation does not cut across Nato or the G7.She wants the club to focus on issues such as migration and security, rather than creating structures.

Truss would like the organisation to focus above all on energy, migration and security, topics that are expected to be on the agenda next week.EU officials have invited 27 EU member states and 17 non-EU nations. The non-EU nations include nine countries hoping to join the EU, including Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia and six western Balkan states, as well as Norway and Switzerland, non-members that are deeply integrated into EU structures. Turkey, whose EU membership hopes have long been on ice, has not publicly accepted its invitation, which was issued despite reservations from Greece and Cyprus.The head of the European Council, Charles Michel, told the Guardian earlier this month that it was obvious the UK should be invited, saying: “The United Kingdom is a friend, a partner, a like-minded partner.”EU officials rejected suggestions in some UK media reports that Truss could send her foreign secretary, James Cleverly, in her place, arguing that only heads of government could attend. Michel has said the new organisation should be a flexible structure like the G20, in response to concerns that it could duplicate other bodies, such as the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe.Sign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterArchie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morningPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Since then, the indictment alleges, Deripaska evaded those sanctions in a variety of ways, using corporate shell companies to hide his activities. From an Easter gift to an unnamed US television host, to a flower delivery to a former member of the Canadian parliament, to an attempt to shift $3m in proceeds from a US music studio to a Russia-based account, the indictment describes actions that were executed by associates on Deripaska’s behalf.The most elaborate, however, involved Deripaska’s alleged girlfriend, Ekaterina Voronina, 33, who has been charged with making false statements to US agents during one of her attempts to enter the US.The indictment alleges that Deripaska and his associates first arranged for Voronina to travel to the US in 2020 for the purposes of having her give birth to her child with Deripaska in the US.The justice department said Deripaska spent hundreds of thousands of dollars for Voronina to take advantage of the US healthcare system because he did not trust the Russian hospital system, and at one point instructed her to be “careful” when discussing her plans to US agents . Following the birth of their child, who is an American, Deripaska’s associates then conspired to try to conceal Deripaska’s identity as the child’s father, in part by slightly changing the spelling of the child’s last name.When Voronina tried to enter the US again in 2022 to give birth to the couple’s second child, she was denied entry and returned to Istanbul, through which she had flown to enter the US from Russia.One Deripaska associate, a naturalized US citizen named Olga Shriki, was arrested on Thursday morning.The metals magnate has been at the heart of high-profile political fights in the UK, where he was added to the sanctions list by the government this year in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.He previously faced scrutiny after it emerged that Peter Mandelson, who was then trade secretary, had been entertained aboard the oligarch’s “superyacht”, the $65m Queen K, off Corfu. Later it emerged that the Tory shadow chancellor, George Osborne, had also met with the Russian and had invited a Conservative fundraiser to also visit Deripaska on his yacht.Deripaska gained control of vast previously state-owned aluminium assets following the fall of the Soviet Union, which he later consolidated within the Rusal group, in partnership with the former Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich, a fellow sanctions target.Rusal, which was part of Deripaska’s En+ Group, raised $1.5bn with a listing on the London Stock Exchange in 2017.Deripaska and his associates were not immediately available for comment.</Text></Article><Article paper="guardian" author="[{'name': 'Patrick Wintour Diplomatic editor'}]"><Text>Arab ambassadors in London are urging Liz Truss not to go ahead with “an illegal and ill-judged” plan to move the British embassy to Jerusalem.Some Arab diplomats have even said the plan could jeopardise talks on a highly prized free trade deal between the UK and the Gulf Cooperation Council due to be completed this year.A private letter was sent before Truss’s trip to the UN in New York, where she confirmed the review, but after the state funeral of Queen.EU allies have told the UK they think the move is unwise and are privately speculating that Truss took the initiative not just due to her close ties with Israel but out of her desire to be noticed as a disruptive force.It was expected that a predictable group of pro-Palestinian countries represented in London would object to the proposed embassy move, but the letter sent by the diplomats has the endorsement of all of the Arab countries, including those that support the Abraham accords signed in September 2020. The accords are designed to lead to a general warming of ties with Israel for its signatories, including Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates.It is understood that some of the Arab states most inclined to the Abraham accords are most disturbed by the move since they fear the accords will be damaged by the claim they opened the way to it.The Guardian view on moving the British embassy to Jerusalem: don’t do it | EditorialRead moreHowever, making a future trade deal contingent on retaining the UK embassy in Tel Aviv may prove a step too far for some more pragmatic Gulf state capitals. It remains to be seen how vocal they will make their objections.In the Tory leadership campaign, Truss announced in a letter to Conservative Friends of Israel that she would open a review of the location of the UK embassy, something she had not done as foreign secretary. She highlighted last week that she was instituting that review in a readout of a bilateral meeting in New York with the Israeli prime minister, Yair Lapid. No details of how the review is being conducted inside the Foreign Office have been made public.One former British diplomat described Truss as a “pound-shop Trump”, a reference to the decision by the US administration under Donald Trump to make the same move in 2018. He said: “She seems to think she should ape Donald Trump. The difference is that the US is big enough to get its way in the Middle East. The UK is not. If the UK shifted its embassy it would have a domino effect amongst some countries in the European Union, such as Hungary, but probably not, and will damage British interest in the Arab world.”Only four other countries have moved their embassy to Jerusalem.Husam Zomlot, the Palestinian ambassador in London, said: “Any embassy move would be a blatant violation of international law and the UK’s historic responsibilities. It undermines the two-state solution and inflames an already volatile situation in Jerusalem, the rest of the occupied territories, and among communities in the UK and worldwide. It would be disastrous.”</Text></Article><Article paper="guardian" author="[{'name': 'Staff and agencies'}]"><Text>Iran has stepped up pressure on celebrities and journalists over the wave of women-led protests sparked by outrage over the death of Mahsa Amini, after she was arrested by the Islamic republic’s morality police.Film-makers, athletes, musicians and actors have backed the demonstrations, and many saw it as a signal when the national football team remained in their black tracksuits when the anthems were played before a match in Vienna against Senegal.How the death of a Kurdish woman galvanised women all over IranRead more“We will take action against the celebrities who have fanned the flames of the riots,” Tehran provincial governor Mohsen Mansouri said, according to the ISNA news agency.Iran’s judiciary chief Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei similarly charged that “those who became famous thanks to support from the system have joined the enemy when times are difficult”.The warnings came after almost two weeks of protests across Iran and a deadly crackdown that, human rights group Amnesty International says, has been marked by “ruthless violence by security forces”.Iran Human Rights, a Norway-based group, said on Thursday that at least 83 people, including children, had been killed during the repression.Public anger flared after Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish woman, died in custody on 16 September, three days after her arrest for allegedly breaching Iran’s strict rules for women on wearing hijab headscarves and modest clothing.“Woman, Life, Freedom!” protesters have chanted ever since, in Iran’s biggest demonstrations in almost three years, in which women have defiantly burned their headscarves and cut their hair.President Ebrahim Raisi warned that, despite “grief and sorrow” over Amini’s death, public security “is the red line of the Islamic Republic of Iran and no one is allowed to break the law and cause chaos”.Iran on Thursday slammed “interference” in its internal affairs by France over a statement in support of the protests, having earlier complained to Britain and Norway.Solidarity protests with Iranian women have been held worldwide, and rallies are planned in 70 cities Saturday.One protest erupted in Afghanistan’s capital Kabul, where women rallied outside Iran’s embassy with banners that read: “Iran has risen, now it’s our turn!” and “From Kabul to Iran, say no to dictatorship!”Iran on Thursday arrested the reporter Elahe Mohammadi, who had covered Amini’s funeral, her lawyer said, becoming the latest of a growing number of journalists to be detained.Police have also arrested journalist Niloufar Hamedi of the reformist Shargh daily, who went to the hospital where Amini lay in a coma and helped expose the case to the world.Sign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterArchie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morningPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A source, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue, told Reuters Turnell and the ousted leader had been given “three years each, no hard labour”. Both had pleaded not guilty.Myanmar shadow embassy opens in Canberra to champion Aung San Suu Kyi’s ousted governmentRead moreThe Australian foreign minister, Penny Wong, rejected the court ruling and called for Turnell’s immediate release.“Prof Turnell was tried in a closed court – Australia’s chargé d’affaires and consular officials in Myanmar made every effort to attend the verdict but were denied access to the court,” Wong said. “We will continue to take every opportunity to advocate strongly for Prof Turnell until he has returned to his family in Australia. We acknowledge the strong international support shown for him, including from our region.”There is very limited information about court proceedings involving political prisoners in Myanmar, where more than 15,600 people have been arrested since last year’s coup. Hearings are not accessible to journalists and defence lawyers have been gagged from talking to media.Aung San Suu Kyi had already been sentenced to 20 years in prison over separate cases, and is still facing trials.The military had accused Turnell of possessing confidential documents when he was detained last year, according to the Irrawaddy news site. Turnell has reportedly denied the charge and said the documents were not confidential, but were economic recommendations he had given in his capacity as adviser to Aung San Suu Kyi’s government.The case against him has been widely condemned by rights groups. Aung San Suu Kyi given six extra years in prison on corruption chargesRead moreElaine Pearson, the Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said the sentences handed down were a “cruel injustice”. “The junta’s willingness to pile sentences on Aung San Suu Kyi, along with the Australian economist Sean Turnell and three of her ministers, shows that Myanmar’s military has no qualms about their international pariah status.“Concerned governments should take this as a clear signal that they need to take concerted action against the junta if they are going to turn the human rights situation around in the country,” she said. Turnell had been denied proper access to legal counsel, she added.Turnell has worked on economic and banking issues in Myanmar since the early 2000s, focusing on promoting reform and growth. He has served as special economic consultant to Aung San Suu Kyi and as a senior economic adviser to the minister of planning, finance and industry. Before this, he worked at the Reserve Bank of Australia.Last month, as the UN special envoy to Myanmar, Noeleen Heyzer, met the junta chief, Min Aung Hlaing, to call for a de-escalation in violence in the country, she also conveyed a request from the Australian government appealing for Turnell’s release.Junta-controlled media later published what it claimed was an account of their meeting, in which Min Aung Hlaing said: “With regard to the case of Mr Sean Turnell, should the Australian government take positive steps, we will not need to take stern actions. In the Mr Sean Turnell’s case, the evidence shows that severe penalties could be imposed.”At least 15,683 people have been arrested since the military took power on 1 February 2021, and 12,540 remain in detention, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, which tracks arrests and killings.Other foreign nationals being held include Britain’s former ambassador to Myanmar Vicky Bowman, and Toru Kubota, a Japanese film-maker.Separately, Amnesty International launched a report on Thursday that argued Facebook’s algorithms “substantially contributed” to atrocities committed by the military against Myanmar’s Rohingya minority when Aung San Suu Kyi was in power.“In the months and years leading up to the atrocities, Facebook’s algorithms were intensifying a storm of hatred against the Rohingya which contributed to real-world violence,” said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s secretary general.“While the Myanmar military was committing crimes against humanity against the Rohingya, Meta was profiting from the echo chamber of hatred created by its hate-spiralling algorithms.”Amnesty’s reassessment of Facebook’s role in the genocide is based on the cache of documents released by the whistleblower Frances Haugen in 2021, which “enable a renewed understanding of the manner in which [Facebook’s] content shaping algorithms filed the mass violence”, the report said.In a statement, Meta’s Rafael Frankel said: “Our safety and integrity work in Myanmar remains guided by feedback from local civil society organisations and international institutions, including the UN fact-finding mission on Myanmar; the human rights impact assessment we commissioned in 2018; as well as our ongoing human rights risk management.”Additional reporting by Alex Hern</Text></Article><Article paper="guardian" author="[{'name': 'Alex Hern'}]"><Text>Apple has begun making iPhone 14s in India, as it moves some production away from China for the first time against a backdrop of Chinese Covid-19 pandemic lockdowns and geopolitical tensions between the US and the country’s communist government.A production line in Chennai has begun operation, assembling the iPhone 14 for the domestic Indian market. The move, which marks the first time the company has assembled iPhones outside of China in the same year they were released, is part of a plan to disentangle its manufacturing operations from the Chinese state.Apple unveiled its latest line-up of iPhones earlier this month. The iPhone 14 will have improved cameras, faster processors and longer lasting batteries at the same prices as last year’s models.India is the world’s second-largest smartphone market after China and Apple has been assembling phones there since 2017. But until now, manufacturing operations in the country, alongside similar operations in Brazil, had been focused on assembling older models.According to a report from analysts at JP Morgan, Apple is aiming to produce a quarter of all iPhone 14s in India by 2025, and the same proportion of all its products outside China by the same date, compared with about 5% now. The company also intends to produce a fifth of all its iPads and Apple Watches, and more than half of all its AirPods, in factories in Vietnam by the same date.Relations between China and the US have become increasingly strained, causing difficulties for Apple.This summer, Apple requested suppliers in Taiwan – including chip manufacturers – to label the origin of their products as “Chinese Taipei” in order to comply with a long-standing but previously unenforced Chinese rule that requires imported goods to falsely suggest the island is part of the People’s Republic of China. The request followed the US House speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taipei.Taiwan has an opposite rule, requiring products be labelled as either “Taiwan” or the country’s official name, “Republic of China”.The choice to require suppliers to deny Taiwan’s independent existence has led to criticism from around the world.GreatFire, which works against Chinese censorship online, noted that the move was an escalation from a previous decision by Apple, which removed the Taiwan flag from emoji keyboards for users in China and Hong Kong.“Is it a question of time before Apple starts removing apps whose name contains the characters [for] Taiwan without specifying ‘province of China’?” the organisation asked.</Text></Article><Article paper="guardian" author="[{'name': 'Severin Carrell'}]"><Text>An emergency plan is being drawn up to save the capercaillie, one of the UK’s most elusive and threatened woodland birds, after its numbers plunged.The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds said the latest population survey found its estimated population had fallen from roughly 1,114 in 2015/16 to about 542 birds last winter, putting it at a critically low level.Officials in the Cairngorms national park are working on plans to close and reroute paths used by ramblers, dog walkers and mountain bikers through the Highland forests where capercaillie mate and nests, in a final effort to halt the species’ decline.In previous surveys 20 and 30 years ago, ornithologists estimated there were roughly 2,000 capercaillie in Scotland. Since then, unfavourable weather during early summer – thought to be influenced by climate change – has frequently hit their breeding.Once seen as far west as Loch Lomond and across Highland Perthshire, the bird is now almost entirely restricted to forests in the Badenoch and Strathspey area of the Cairngorms, where it feeds on blaeberries, pine seeds and shoots.The capercaillie is the largest member of the grouse family. It was the first species to be deliberately reintroduced into the UK, from Sweden in 1837. It had previously been hunted into extinction, and this year the scientific advisory committee for NatureScot, the government conservation agency, warned that at the present rate of decline it could again become extinct in the UK in two to three decades.Landowners have been stripping out deer fences known to kill capercaillie as they fly, introduced voluntary requests for walkers to keep dogs on their leads and asked walkers and mountain bikers to stay on marked paths through breeding areas from April to August.Intensive efforts are under way to increase native pine forests in the Cairngorms, the main capercaillie habitat, through an alliance of landowners called Cairngorms Connect, some of whom are at the forefront of the rewilding movement in the Highlands.Andy Ford, the park’s director of nature and climate change, said there were now moves in hand to stop walkers, cyclists and dogs disturbing capercaillie during the breeding season, when males gather in mating areas known as a lek – the Old Norse word for play – to fight, display and establish dominance.He said the national park and its partners were pursuing more radical proposals. The survey results had “really brought home the sense of urgency”, he said. “We’ve seen the capercaillie declining and have invested a significant amount of time and money doing what we can. What this does is say we need to do more. We’re going to need an emergency plan for the next three to five years. What more do we need to do to act at speed, and act together wherever possible?”Ford said the national park put heavy emphasis on collaborative agreements with residents and visitors; mountain bikers and ramblers had already shown they were committed to voluntary restrictions. New bylaws to close down the most sensitive areas during the breeding season could be an option in future, if the present measures fail.Sign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterArchie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morningPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Their appraisals have also underestimated the distances people go, especially given the rising popularity of mountain biking, e-bikes and running.”</Text></Article><Article paper="guardian" author="[{'name': 'Sandra Laville Environment correspondent'}]"><Text>A majority of the public believe nature is under threat and needs urgent action to protect and restore it, according to a YouGov poll.The poll for the National Trust, RSPB and WWF comes as they and other mainstream green groups are mobilising their millions of members to counter what they say is the government’s attack on nature.More than 8,000 adults were surveyed before the government announced the creation of low-tax investment zones, where “burdensome” environmental and planning rules will be lifted, and details emerged of the scale of environmental laws derived from the EU that are to be scrapped or rewritten in the retained EU law revocation and reform bill.Eighty-one per cent of the respondents said they believed nature was under threat and that more needed to be done urgently to protect and restore it. Forty-eight per cent said they were willing to take action themselves to reverse the damage.The charities are inviting people to develop a set of public demands to protect nature’s future by visiting peoplesplanfornature.org before 30 October. They are also calling on the prime minister, Liz Truss, and the environment secretary, Ranil Jayawardena, to take rapid action. The YouGov poll published on Friday suggests the public want action to clean up rivers, greater consideration of nature in the planning and house-building system and strengthened legal protections. Most of these protections stem from EU laws that were rolled over into UK law after Brexit. They are now under threat from a new bill that has listed 570 environmental laws to be taken off the statute books by December 2023. They include laws that cover sewage pollution in rivers, air quality and pesticide controls.The majority of respondents said they had witnessed a decline in nature and wildlife in their local area, 65% in the number and variety of insects they see, 58% in birds, 60% in mammals and 59% in green spaces such as parks and woodlands.The director general of the National Trust, Hilary McGrady, , the CEO of the RSPB, Beccy Speight, and the chief executive of WWF-UK, Tanya Steele, said in a joint statement: “This government, elected on their greenest ever manifesto, is now contemplating breaking its promises on vital protections for the UK’s nature, risking catastrophic consequences.“From abandoning fundamental legal protections for wildlife to failing farmers committed to sustainable agriculture, this would be an attack on nature at the worst possible time.“The desire to defend nature unites people in every community from Caerphilly to Cumbria, Antrim to Aberdeen, and we must all be part of the conversation about how we protect and restore it.”In response to the outpouring of anger from mainstream environmental charities towards government policies this week, Jayawardena attempted to “set the record straight”.He said the claims that government policies including low-tax investment zones and apparent changes to the environment land management system, which pays farmers to make environmental improvements, were harmful to nature were “simply untrue.”</Text></Article><Article paper="guardian" author="[{'name': 'Pippa Crerar Political editor'}]"><Text>Liz Truss has previously suggested universal benefits such as the state pension should be scrapped because of the “huge expense” to taxpayers of “recycling” their money through the system – prompting fears she could go further still with her plans to cut back the benefits bill.The proposal, included in her motion to the Liberal Democrat Youth conference in spring 1995, highlighted the “enormous – and rising – cost of pensions and child benefit”, calling for a “search for realistic alternatives to universal benefits”.Truss, who left the party the next year to join the Conservatives, had added that it was not “socially desirable to pay out universal benefits in the current fashion”, given the “huge expense to the taxpayers of recycling money through the tax system”.Child benefit was removed for higher-rate taxpayers in 2013 but remains universal for some families earning below the £50,000 threshold who do not qualify for universal credit. All older people qualify for a state pension and winter fuel benefits.There is no suggestion Truss plans to scrap either benefit, but her earlier views may raise concerns, as she promised to clamp down on the benefits system during her leadership campaign and has already announced plans to cut working age benefits and for “efficiency savings” across all government departments.The Lib Dem pensions spokesperson, Wendy Chamberlain, said: “We are seeing this government’s true colours. It’s little surprise Liz Truss is refusing to provide help to those who need it most given she has long wanted to scrap the state pension and child benefits.“The Conservative government could not be more out of touch with the British people. As inflation sky-rockets, interest rates spiral and borrowing surges, they’d rather give tax cuts to banks, massive corporations and billionaires than guarantee support for struggling families and pensioners.”A No 10 spokesperson said: “The prime minister’s views are not the same as they were 27 years ago.” However, Truss continues to argue that taxpayers’ money should not “recycled” – or collected by the state only to be redistributed back to them.Kwasi Kwarteng, the chancellor, has already announced plans to cut benefits to encourage more people into the job market, saying that this was part of the government’s plan to “make work pay” by not allowing people to rely solely on welfare as their main form of income.However, the controversial plan has provoked widespread criticism as it ignores people who are out of work because of illness or disability, while unpaid carers, part-time workers and single parents could be unfairly hit by benefit cuts.Chris Philp, the chief secretary to the Treasury, said the government had not yet decided if it would increase benefits in line with inflation, despite Rishi Sunak promising to do so when he was chancellor. Philp defended removing the 45p rate of income tax, despite saying it was “true” that it benefited the rich more than the worse off.Kwarteng, on a visit to Darlington, said it was “premature” to confirm if benefits would rise to match inflation. “We are talking about helping people in the round. It is premature for me to come to a decision on that. But we are absolutely focused on making sure that the most vulnerable in our society are protected through what could be a challenging time,” he said.Sign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterArchie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morningPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Just the fact that he’s reconsidering it, or he’s not committing to it, makes it feel like this is genuinely up for reconsideration.”The Joseph Rowntree Foundation, a charity that conducts and funds research aimed at solving poverty in the UK, said it was “shocking” that the government may not increase benefits by inflation. Iain Porter, a senior policy adviser, said: “Many people across the UK will agree it is morally indefensible that the prime minister would choose to give tax cuts to the richest funded on the backs of the poorest in our society.”James Taylor, director of strategy at the disability equality charity Scope, said: “If the government U-turns on this promise, it would be devastating and lead to disabled people starving and freezing in their own homes. Refusing to increase benefits in line with the true inflation rate would show an utter disdain towards people who need this support.”Alison Garnham, chief executive of Child Poverty Action Group, said: “Children are already going hungry as costs soar. Unless benefits are uprated to match inflation, they will also become the casualties of a collapsing economy. Struggling families will not forgive a chancellor who comes to them for efficiency savings when their cupboards are already bare.”</Text></Article><Article paper="guardian" author="[{'name': 'Diane Taylor'}]"><Text>Hundreds of child asylum seekers are at risk of abuse and neglect due to the Home Office wrongly classifying them as adults, according to two new reports.Reports from the Refugee Council and Greater Manchester Immigration Aid Unit (GMIAU), published on Friday, highlight concerns about the way the Home Office is treating young people upon arriving in the UK.Charities say  over unaccompanied asylum seeker children in UK Read moreThe Home Office does not publish comprehensive data about all stages of the age assessment process for young asylum seekers. The two new reports have been compiled from a mix of freedom of information (FoI) requests to local authorities and their own casework files.According to freedom of information data gathered from 64 local authorities by human rights charity the Helen Bamber Foundation, at least 450 young people who were age disputed by the Home Office in 2021 were referred to local authorities for assessment. Three-quarters of them were found to be children.In the first three months of this year, 211 young asylum seekers were referred to council children’s services after initially having been placed in adult accommodation by the Home Office – two-thirds of them were found to be children. A total of 150 of them were initially placed either in detention centres or in adult accommodation. The Refugee Council has run an Age Disputes Project since 2010. Last year, the it worked with 233 young people whom the Home Office determined to “certainly” be adults. But, after age assessments, 94% were found to be children.The data the government does publish on age assessments can be open to misinterpretation. The organisation Full Fact found some media outlets had incorrectly stated that two-thirds of asylum seekers arriving in the UK between January 2018 and March 2022 who claimed to be children were actually adults. In fact, it showed roughly 20% were in fact adults.The government rules around age assessment have changed. Previously, young people who looked “significantly over 25” were classed as adults by Home Office officials. Now these officials can assess young people as adults if they look “significantly over 18”. The Home Office has set up a new National Age Assessment Board with its own social workers carrying out age assessments.In one case, a 16-year-old was wrongly assessed to be 28 by the Home Office. In another, a 17-year-old was assessed as being six years older than he was. Human rights campaigners are fearful that children wrongly age assessed as adults could be forcibly removed to Rwanda by the Home Office.The Refugee Council has called for the Home Office to publish full data on age assessments for young asylum seekers and for independent oversight of the process from an Ofsted-style body.Sign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterArchie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morningPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We urge the government to immediately take heed of our recommendations and do better by vulnerable children it has a duty to protect.”The GMIAU report states: “We call for a drastic change in Home Office culture and decision-making as well as safeguards to ensure children are protected from harm.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “Age assessments are challenging but vital. Children are at risk when asylum-seeking adults claim to be children, or children are wrongly treated as adults. Our reforms through the Nationality and Borders Act aim to make assessments more consistent and robust by using scientific measures, and creating a new national age assessment board. If there is doubt whether a claimant is an adult or child, they will be referred for a local authority assessment and will be treated as a child until a decision on their age is made.”</Text></Article><Article paper="guardian" author="[{'name': 'Denis Campbell Health policy editor'}]"><Text>Some nurses are so hard up that they are having to not eat at work in order to feed and clothe their children, research among hospital bosses has found.Lack of money is also prompting some NHS staff to call in sick in the days before they get paid because they can no longer afford the travel costs for their shift. Others are taking a second job outside the NHS in an effort to make ends meet.The impact of the cost of living crisis on health service workers in England has emerged in a survey of chief executives, chairs and other senior figures in health trusts undertaken by NHS Providers, which represents trusts.Most UK medical students struggle to afford essentials, survey finds Read moreMiriam Deakin, the director of policy and strategy at NHS Providers, said: “There are heart-rending stories of nurses choosing between eating during the day and being able to buy a school uniform for their children at home.“Increasing numbers of nurses and other staff, particularly in the lower pay bands, are finding they are unable to afford to work in the NHS.”More than a quarter (27%) of trusts already operate food banks for staff, and another 19% plan to open one, to help relieve the acute financial difficulties faced by staff.The survey also found that some staff: Are stopping contributing to their NHS pension in order to free up cash. Cannot fill up their cars because of petrol price rises. Have mental health issues due to the stress of paying their bills. The situation is so serious that some low-paid health staff, such as healthcare assistants, are quitting their jobs in the NHS and taking better-paid roles in pubs and shops instead, NHS chiefs said. Two-thirds (68%) of trusts said that staff leaving for better terms and conditions elsewhere was having a “significant or severe impact”, and exacerbating existing recruitment and retention problems.Deakin said: “Trust leaders are seeing a slowdown in people willing to join the NHS, as well as looking to join other industries such as hospitality or retail which offer more competitive pay. The sad fact is some can earn more working for online retailers or in supermarkets.“It’s like the UK has gone back to Victorian times, when workers were so poor they couldn’t afford to feed their families,” said Sara Gorton, head of health at the union Unison.“This is a shocking state of affairs. Ministers should be ashamed that things have come to this.”The Guardian reported last month how trusts are trying to help staff cope with soaring inflation through a variety of schemes, including offering hardship grants, paying for children’s school uniforms and providing low-cost food in their restaurants.Trusts are bracing themselves for a potential wave of strikes this winter by staff angry at the government offering them only a 3% pay rise at a time when inflation is about 10%. One trust boss said that possible coordination of walkouts by different groups of workers could make it difficult for normal services to be maintained.NHS Providers also found cost of living pressures were affecting patients, with more people attending A&amp;E with related mental health issues. Some patients who had to visit hospital regularly had started to only attend some appointments because of the travel costs involved.A government spokesperson said: “We know NHS staff are struggling with cost of living pressures, and we have given over 1 million NHS staff a pay rise of at least £1,400 in line with the recommendations of the independent pay review body.“The government has also taken action to save a typical household an average of £1,000 a year on energy bills through a new ‘energy price guarantee’ – protecting them from soaring energy costs.”</Text></Article><Article paper="guardian" author="[{'name': 'Tom Ambrose'}]"><Text>A new 50p design featuring an image of King Charles III has been unveiled by the Royal Mint and will enter circulation by the end of the year.Meanwhile, a special memorial coin range commemorating Queen Elizabeth II will be released on Monday at 9am. Charles’ portrait will appear on a £5 crown and a 50p celebrating the Queen.Nicola Howell, chief commercial officer at the Royal Mint, told the PA news agency: “We expect customers will start to be able to receive the commemorative range from October and then we expect the 50p memorial circulating coin to be appearing in people’s change probably from December.”The King’s effigy, which has received the personal approval of Charles, was created by sculptor Martin Jennings, the Mint said. As is tradition, the King’s portrait will face to the left, the opposite direction from Queen Elizabeth II.Chris Barker, of the Royal Mint Museum, said: “Charles has followed that general tradition that we have in British coinage, going all the way back to Charles II actually, that the monarch faces in the opposite direction to their predecessor.”The Latin inscription surrounding the effigy reads: “:: CHARLES III :: D :: G :: REX :: F :: D :: 5 POUNDS :: 2022”, which translates to: “King Charles III, by the Grace of God, Defender of the Faith”.The design will start to appear on circulating and commemorative coins produced over the coming months.The Royal Mint, based in Llantrisant, south Wales, has depicted the royal family on coins for over 1,100 years, documenting each monarch since Alfred the Great.Anne Jessopp, its chief executive officer, said: “The Royal Mint has been trusted to make coins bearing the monarch’s effigy for over 1,100 years and we are proud to continue this tradition into the reign of King Charles III.Sign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterArchie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morningPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Storefronts were sandbagged to ward off high water levels in an area prone to inundation.Along the Battery area at the southern tip of the 350-year-old city’s peninsula, locals and tourists alike took selfies against the choppy backdrop of whitecaps in Charleston harbor as palm trees bent in gusty wind.Hurricane Ian: 'Historic storm' wreaks havoc in Florida as trapped residents are rescued - videoFlorida governor Ron DeSantis gave a briefing on Thursday night where said at least 700 rescues, mostly by air, had been conducted so far, involving the US Coast Guard, the National Guard and urban search-and-rescue teams.Joe Biden said Ian “could be the deadliest hurricane in Florida’s history”, adding at an afternoon briefing at the headquarters of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) that he was “hearing early reports of what may be substantial loss of life”.Local officials were more cautious. Chris Constance, commissioner of Charlotte county, said he knew of six confirmed fatalities, but was unaware of the circumstances. In Lee county, sheriff Carmine Marceno said he was aware of “roughly five”.Hurricane Ian map - 18.23 BST updateAuthorities confirmed at least one Florida death – a 72-year-old man in Deltona who fell into a canal while using a hose to drain his pool in the heavy rain, the Volusia county sheriff’s office said. Two storm deaths were reported in Cuba.Earlier in the day Ian had been downgraded to a tropical storm as it crept across the Florida peninsula and emerged in the Atlantic Ocean but regained hurricane level, category one, in the early evening as it spun towards South Carolina where it was expected to makes its second landfall on Friday morning local time.The National Hurricane Center said that by midnight the storm’s maximum sustained winds increased to more than 80mph (128km/h), and governors of Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia declared states of emergency.Eighteen Cuban migrants missing after boat sinks during Hurricane IanRead moreBiden also declared a state of emergency in South Carolina, where some Charlotte residents had chosen to evacuate on Thursday afternoon.In coastal south-west Florida, desperate residents posted to social media sites, pleading for rescue for themselves or loved ones. Helicopters were in the air at first light, assisting recovery efforts by coast guard and national guard troops.“Time is of the essence and we’ve got a lot of people we need to help,” DeSantis said at a morning press conference.“They’re focusing their rescue efforts on those areas that were most hard hit.”Boats are partially submerged at a marina in the aftermath of Hurricane Ian in Fort Myers, Florida, on Thursday. Photograph: Giorgio Viera/AFP/Getty ImagesDeSantis said Ian’s impact across Florida was widespread, caused by flooding from a deluge of three months’ worth of rain in 48 hours in some areas, the unprecedented storm surge, and category 4 winds.Aerial video and photographs showed massive devastation and flooding in beach communities from Naples to Fort Myers, with homes and businesses reduced to matchwood, and other buildings, mobile homes, boats and vehicles totally wrecked or submerged.More than 2 million people remained without power, DeSantis said, adding that some areas could be without electricity for weeks while power grids are completely rebuilt.“The impacts of this storm are historic, and the damage that was done has been historic. And this is just off initial assessment,” he said.“This storm is having broad impacts across the state, and some of the flooding you’re going to see in areas hundreds of miles from where this made landfall are going to set records.”A resident at a mobile home park checks homes in Fort Myers, Florida, on Thursday, one day after Hurricane Ian made landfall. Photograph: Joseph Agcaoili/AFP/Getty ImagesIn an afternoon update, DeSantis spoke of a “biblical storm surge” sweeping across Sanibel island. “It’s washed away roads, washed away structures,” he said, referring to the partial collapse of Sanibel causeway, the only road route to the mainland.Biden made a major disaster declaration for nine of the worst-affected counties, freeing federal resources to supplement local rescue and recovery efforts, and guaranteeing government money for an initial 30-day period for costs likely to run into billions of dollars.“Many families are hurting today, and our country hurts with them,” the president said.“We’re continuing to see deadly rainfall, catastrophic storm surges, roads and homes flooded, millions of people without power and thousands hunkered down in schools and community centers.“They’re wondering what’s going to be left when they get to go home.”Biden said federal funds would cover “the majority of the cost of rebuilding public buildings, like schools and fire stations, and folks in Florida who have destroyed or damaged homes”.He said individual assistance payments of up to $75,000 would be available for home repairs or to replace lost property.Residents from Punta Gorda on the south-west coast to Orlando and Cape Canaveral, meanwhile, were assessing the damage from the massive flooding, rainfall and punishing winds.Aerial view of damaged homes in Punta Gorda after Hurricane Ian moved through the Gulf Coast of Florida. Photograph: Win McNamee/Getty Images“I don’t think that we can quantify it yet. But I can tell you that it is going to be catastrophic,” Deanne Criswell, the Fema administrator, told CNN.“The amount of impact to these communities is going to be significant. A number of these families are living in mobile homes. We are preparing for the potential of thousands of families that are going to need assistance.”In Lee county, officials were attempting to calculate a death toll. Sheriff Marceno walked back an earlier claim of “hundreds”, but said he feared what rescue crews would find.“There are people I know did not evacuate,” he told CNN. “They tried to take cover, they’ve gone to the second floor and the attic [but] the water got so high here with a surge of approximately 16ft give or take, that’s what’s going to compromise structures and also that’s the most deadly.”Kevin Anderson, the Fort Myers mayor, said rescue operations were continuing and it was too soon for an accurate figure. “I just know there are several deaths related to the storm,” he said.The storm surge flooded the lower-level emergency room of the HCA Florida Fawcett hospital in Port Charlotte, while fierce winds tore part of the fourth-floor roof from its intensive care unit, according to Dr Birgit Bodine.Intensive care staff were forced to evacuate the medium-sized hospital’s sickest patients to other floors.Bodine said incoming storm injuries could make things worse. “The ambulances may be coming soon and we don’t know where to put them in the hospital at this point,” she said. “We’re doubled and tripled up.”The Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this

that the FBI supposedly “planted” some of the highly-sensitive documents seized from his Mar-a-Lago resort, as he has suggested, until his lawyers have reviewed the seized materials.The order from US district court judge Aileen Cannon, who is overseeing the special master case and is a Trump appointee, also pushed back several key interim deadlines that consequently extends the review’s final date of completion from the end of November to mid-December.Cannon’s ruling means Trump does not have to confirm under oath his insinuations that the FBI manufactured evidence – one of several assertions he has made, without evidence, in recent weeks that could be used against him should he be charged over illegal retention of government documents.The order marked the first clash between Cannon and the so-called special master, senior US district court judge Raymond Dearie, who had ordered Trump certify by Friday whether the inventory of seized materials included anything that had not been in his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida.Special master in Trump documents case described as fair and no-nonsenseRead moreDearie’s instruction left Trump’s lawyers in a dilemma: if they acknowledged that the FBI had not planted evidence and in fact, documents marked classified were at the property, that could be used as evidence against Trump given all such documents had previously been subpoenaed.The special master had also ordered Trump to sort any documents over which he intended to assert executive privilege into two buckets: privilege to shield materials from people outside the executive branch, such as Congress, and people inside the executive branch, such as the justice department.But in siding with Trump’s lawyers who resisted making such declarations, in part because it could form defense arguments should Trump be indicted, Cannon’s order said that the former president did not have to make such a statement, at least for now.“There shall be no separate requirement on plaintiff at this stage, prior to the review of any of the seized materials, to lodge ex ante final objections to the accuracy of defendant’s inventory, its descriptions, or its content,” the judge wrote.Cannon also extended the entire timeline of the special master process, delaying the final completion of the review to 16 December, as she pushed back a number of key interim deadlines that would govern how quickly the examination of the 11,000 documents proceeds.The delays would not affect the justice department’s criminal investigation into Trump’s potential retention of national defense information, after the US court of appeals for the 11th circuit ruled this month the government could regain access to about 100 documents marked classified.But it does ensure that Trump now does not have to address under oath whether he supposedly declassified the documents found at Mar-a-Lago or that the FBI planted some of the seized materials – he has supplied no evidence for either claim – until after the midterm elections in November.The judge wrote that Trump and the justice department would have until 5 October to finalize a contract with a vendor to digitize the 11,000 documents so the review can commence, and gave the justice department until 13 October to make copies of the documents available to Trump’s team.The justice department should file a notice of completion by 14 October, the ruling said, and then Trump would have 21 days after the notice is filed to designate whether they think any of the documents are protected by privilege and which are presidential or personal records.“Plaintiff’s designations shall be on a document-by-document basis,” Cannon wrote. “For any document that plaintiff designates as privileged and/or personal, plaintiff shall include a statement adequately explaining the precise basis for the designation.”The former president’s lawyers and the justice department then have no more than 10 days to submit to Dearie a log about any disagreements over the privilege claims, after which the order instructed the special master to issue a report and recommendations to resolve any disputes.Cannon also sided with Trump regarding how the process should take place: Cannon rejected the recommendation by the justice department to have Trump make privilege claims on a rolling basis and ordered Trump to make one comprehensive log at the end of the 21-day review period.</Text></Article><Article paper="guardian" author="[{'name': 'Maya Yang'}]"><Text>A video of a man rescuing a cat during Hurricane Ian in south-west Florida has gone viral, prompting praise from many viewers.“My boyfriend saving a cat from flood waters near Bonita Beach,” wrote Megan Cruz Scavo in a caption that accompanied a video of her boyfriend, 29-year old Mike Ross, trudging across knee-deep water on Wednesday afternoon to rescue a stranded cat.The terrified-looking orange and white cat was sitting atop an air conditioner in Bonita Hills, south-west Florida as it attempted to seek refuge from torrential waters that gushed beneath it.Ross, who was forced to evacuate to his parents’ home because his own house was “10 ft underwater,” spotted the cat at around 2pm when he looked outside the window, he told the Washington Post.At that point, the hurricane had yet to make landfall but “the storm surge had rushed up”, he said.My boyfriend saving a cat from flood waters near Bonita Beach. #HurricaneIan #Naples #Bonita #FortMyers pic.twitter.com/BlBC9P1rdy— Megan Cruz Scavo (@MeganScavo) September 28, 2022 In the video, Ross is shown trudging across rapid-flowing waters as he makes his way towards the cat. As he nears the cat, he gently picks it up and holds it tightly towards his chest.The cat appears to be wet and clings tightly onto Ross, occasionally looking at the camera. Ross’s mother, Marybeth Ross, filmed the rescue and can be heard saying, “Look at Michael saving the kitty. Awww!”The video has since been viewed 3.4m times on Twitter and has garnered praise and celebration. “I’m sorry, Megan, but he is everyone’s boyfriend now. I don’t make the rules,” wrote one user.“Watching him approach the cat with respect was beautiful! That poor sweetie was clearly afraid, and trusted him to care for it,” someone else said.Nevertheless, others have expressed concerns towards the many more animals that will not be saved during the storm. “This kitty was saved, but I daren’t think of how many others won’t be. It breaks my heart,” one person wrote.Ross and his girlfriend have since named the cat Ian and have launched a fundraising page to raise money for their home which was badly damaged by the hurricane.“We are a young couple in Naples, FL raising money to help restore our home – which suffered terrible damage – and the homes of others after the devastation seen from Hurricane Ian,” they wrote. “In honor of Ian, and all people and pets affected, we are donating half of the proceeds raised by this to the Naples Humane Society,” they added. </Text></Article><Article paper="guardian" author="[{'name': 'Sandra Laville'}]"><Text>Young people from some of the countries most affected by climate breakdown have warned they are not victims but a force to be reckoned with in the run-up to a UN climate conference in Egypt.Led by climate groups across Africa and the Middle East, hundreds of activists from countries that are the least responsible for the crisis but are experiencing the worst impacts have gathered in Tunisia to prepare for what they say will be a collective fight for justice for their countries and communities, which they will take to Cop27 next month.They are campaigning on issues including adaptation funding and recompense for damage from countries that have been the most responsible for global heating.At Cop26 in Glasgow, delegates promised to give a total of $350m to help the worst affected countries adapt to the climate emergency. But promises for funding have been broken in the past, and the issue of adaptation funding, along with demands for loss and damage funding to be paid to vulnerable countries by the US and Europe, is a clash point with the global south.Maria Reyes, 20, from Mexico, attended the Tunis climate camp because her experience as a representative of the global south at Cop26 was so disappointing. She said the gathering was exclusive and member states wasted time arguing over commas, rather than tackling the issues that mattered.“I came home after the Cop with a deep need to get involved in local resistance, because Glasgow made me lose all confidence in international politics and made me realise that the real resistance against the climate crisis comes from grassroots and indigenous communities,” she said. “I wanted to join the camp to be part of the construction of a space in which we can develop capacities and plan how we can articulate ourselves during Cop.”Ayisha Siddiqa, 23, an activist from Pakistan, who has organised many school strikes for climate since 2019, believes in order to fight the crisis, people have to address the injustices that mean people from Middle East, Africa, Latin America and southern Asia, whose countries contributed least, are suffering the most.“I come from a tribal community in northern Pakistan and our way of life is in extreme danger as heatwaves become more common, our glaciers melt and flash flooding wipes away entire villages. These are things we cannot adapt to, and loss of community, culture and families we can not recover from … I was very eager to attend this camp in Tunisia and build a community with people who have been doing environmental work on ground.”Some of those who attended the camp will travel to Egypt for Cop27, in the hope that the conference will this time properly address the needs of countries least responsible for the climate emergency.Omar Elmawi, 34, from Kenya, is a climate activist who has coordinated a campaign to stop the world’s longest heated crude oil pipeline in east Africa, which is forecast will contribute at least 700m tonnes of CO2 in the 20 years it is expected to be operational.“Cognisant that I am one of the 3.6 billion people in the developing countries that are bearing the brunt of the climate crisis while we have done little to nothing to cause the problem, joining the camp allowed me to meet and know my fellow climate victims from other global south countries,” Elmawi said.Sign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterArchie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morningPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Two women have died in the past month.Aisha Abakar died after an alleged attack by her father and brothers last week, after they reportedly learned that the unmarried 18-year-old from South Darfur state was pregnant. Her sister, aged 17, was reported to be in a critical condition in hospital after being injured in the same attack. Three men have been arrested.Three days earlier, Tayeser Jumaa, 21, was allegedly killed by her brothers and cousins who believed that she was talking to men on her mobile phone, a campaigner told the Guardian. No arrests have been made.Nahla Yousif, head of the Future Development Organisation, a women’s rights group based in South Darfur state, said the reported cases were the “tip of the iceberg”.“I believe there are so many other similar crimes in the villages and towns that are far from the media. We only get to hear about those which are taken to the police,” she said. “It’s all about ignorance and lack of awareness, they think it’s shameful to see their daughters having relationships. These crimes have always been here, but they are now increasing due to the lack of accountability.”Yousif said more younger women were being targeted because they owned mobile phones.“Even the young women who are activists working in important fields documenting the abuses people go through in the [displacement] camps are now targeted by their relatives,” she said. “We have had to offer shelter to some women because they had smartphones and their relatives assumed they would be chatting with men.”The majority of reported cases this year have occurred in Darfur, where for decades rape has been used as a weapon against women by the Janjaweed militias. Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, who founded the Janjaweed and is head of the feared Rapid Support Forces, is now vice-president of Sudan’s governing sovereign council.Yousif said her organisation was planning protests to raise awareness of “honour killings” and was writing to the Darfur Bar Association to urge lawyers to push for cases to go to court, and not be quietly settled with families.Sulaima Ishaq, head of the unit to stop violence against women in the Ministry of Social Affairs, said the rise in attacks was partly due to the coup in October last year, which had disrupted government institutions.Growing up in the long shadow of Darfur’s genocide  – in picturesRead more“There is no system in place, nothing is functioning, the judicial system is not working,” she said. “They [the government] are too busy releasing those who killed the martyrs during the revolution, despite saying that they did the coup for the safety and the security of the people of Sudan.”Research conducted by the Arab Barometer in 2019 showed that more than a quarter of people over the age of 35 in Sudan thought that “honour killings” were acceptable.In July, a Sudanese woman was sentenced to death by stoning for adultery for the first time in 10 years.Domestic violence is not outlawed in Sudan.</Text></Article><Article paper="guardian" author="[{'name': 'Associated Press in Ouagadougou'}]"><Text>Angry protesters have attacked the French embassy in Burkina Faso’s capital after supporters of the west African nation’s new coup leader accused France of harbouring the ousted interim president, a charge French authorities vehemently denied.Lt Col Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba was overthrown late on Friday less than nine months after he mounted a coup in Burkina Faso, which has been failing to effectively counter rising violence by Islamic extremists.Comments by a junta spokesperson on Saturday set into motion an outburst of anger in Ouagadougou, the capital.“Damiba has tried to retreat to the Kamboinsin French military base to prepare a counter-offensive in order to sow divide amongst our defense and security forces,” said Lt Jean Baptiste Kabre, reading a statement on behalf of the new junta leadership.Burkina Faso’s military leader ousted in second coup this yearRead moreVideo on social media showed residents with lit torches outside the perimeter of the French embassy, and other images showed part of the compound ablaze.In Burkina Faso’s second-largest city, Bobo-Dioulasso, angry crowds also vandalised the French Institute.Damiba’s whereabouts remained unknown but France’s foreign ministry issued a strongly worded statement. “We formally deny involvement in the events unfolding in Burkina Faso. The camp where the French forces are based has never hosted Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba, nor has our embassy,” it said.French foreign ministry spokesperson Anne-Claire Legendre later told France-24 on Saturday night that it was a “confusing situation” in Ouagadougou and she urged French citizens to stay at home.Ibrahim Traore, the 34-year-old army captain who was named in charge after the Friday evening coup was announced on state television, said in interviews that he and his men did not seek to harm Damiba, who unlike other deposed leaders in the region has yet to offer his resignation.“If we wanted, we would take him within five minutes of fighting and maybe he would be dead, the president. But we don’t want this catastrophe,” Traore told the Voice of America. “We don’t want to harm him, because we don’t have any personal problem with him. We’re fighting for Burkina Faso.”He later told Radio Omega: “We have no intention to bring Damiba to justice. We only wish that he would go rest because he is tired, and as for us we are going to continue to do the work.”Roads remained blocked off in Ouagadougou and a helicopter could be heard flying overhead. An internal security analysis for the EU seen by the Associated Press said there was “abnormal military movement” in the city.As uncertainty prevailed, the international community widely condemned the ousting of Damiba, who overthrew the country’s democratically elected president in January. The African Union and the west African region bloc known as Ecowas sharply criticised the developments.“ECOWAS finds this new power grab inappropriate at a time when progress has been made,” the bloc said, citing Damiba’s recent agreement to return to constitutional order by July 2024.After taking power in January, Damiba promised to end the Islamic extremist violence that has forced 2 million people to flee their homes in Burkina Faso. But the group of officers led by Traore said on Friday that Damiba had failed and was being removed.The new junta leadership said it would commit “all fighting forces to refocus on the security issue and the restoration of the integrity of our territory”.But it remains to be seen whether the junta can turn around the crisis. Concerns were mounting on Saturday that the latest political volatility would further distract the military and allow the jihadis to strengthen their grip on the once-peaceful country.For some in Burkina Faso’s military, Damiba was seen as too cozy with former coloniser France, which maintains a military presence in Africa’s Sahel region to help countries fight Islamic extremists. Some who support the new coup leader, Traore, have called on Burkina Faso’s government to seek Russian support instead.</Text></Article><Article paper="guardian" author="[{'name': 'Patrick Greenfield and Sundus Abdi'}]"><Text>Two wildlife organisations, including one headed by Prince Harry, have been accused of caring about animals more than people after three men died following an elephant translocation in Malawi.In July, more than 250 elephants were moved from Liwonde national park in southern Malawi to the country’s second-largest protected area, Kasungu, in a three-way operation between Malawi’s national park service and the NGOs African Parks and the International Fund for Animal Welfare (Ifaw).The translocation was among the largest of its kind ever attempted, according to the NGOs, which have since used images of the 263 elephants being transported for fundraising, with videos of the huge animals being lifted by crane described as “scenes reminiscent of the Disney classic Dumbo”.But the promotional video and blog posts do not mention that two people in nearby communities were killed during the translocation by two bull elephants moved to Kasungu national park in July. A third person was killed by an elephant in September.The Guardian has seen images of the men after they were trampled, and a community representative said that elephants and buffaloes had been straying into villages near the park, looking for food on farms and scaring villagers.Malidadi Langa, chair of an association of villages near Kasungu national park, said Ifaw and the national park service had not finished building a fence to protect communities before moving the elephants. He said African Parks, whose president, the prince, has helped with previous translocations in Malawi, had rushed the movement of the animals.“We welcomed the translocation of these elephants because it will improve tourism for Kasungu. But we believe they should have completed the fence first,” Langa said. “When they moved the first batch of elephants, within a week or so they had broken out of the park from the unfenced side and went into villages. One guy was killed. When we raised the issue, they said the elephants are disoriented and bound to get out of the park. Around the same week, an elephant killed someone else on the other side of the park.“The irony is that Liwonde national park, from where the elephants came, which is run by African Parks, is fully fenced,” he said. “The experience has shown that these conservation agencies care more about animals than people.”In a statement, Malawi’s national park service confirmed three men had died: Collins Chisi, 40, and Joseph Blackson, 29, in two separate incidents on 12 July, and John Kayedzeka, 30, who died on 16 September. They said in all of the deaths, community members had got too close to the animals while taking photos. Two bull elephants were shot dead in accordance with Malawian law after the first two incidents.Langa said the families of those who died were facing uncertain futures, and urged the NGOs to provide continued financial support. He said they had been given a one-off payment of about $160 (£140).Ifaw is understood to be exploring how to give more support to the families but disputed that there was an agreement with the community about a fence before the elephants were moved. The NGO said it had already funded the construction of 25 miles of fencing and had committed to repairing and extending a further 15 miles on the park’s eastern boundary, where the incident occurred.“In all, 150 community members – including women – have been employed to work on the fence. A squad patrols the fence daily to ensure it remains unbreached and that any damage is swiftly repaired,” a spokesperson for Ifaw said.“To prevent any further risk to the local communities, security has been enhanced with helicopter availability, rapid response rangers stationed at the extreme ends of the fence, and satellite-collared elephants monitored 24/7,” the spokesperson added. Support had been provided to the dead men’s families, including providing food, transport and coffins for the funerals.The elephant population in Liwonde, where the elephants came from, had grown to nearly 600, causing damage to the park’s biodiversity and increasing the risk of human-elephant conflict in surrounding villages, according to African Parks.To ease pressure on Liwonde the elephants were moved, along with buffalo, impala, sable, warthog and waterbuck, to Kasungu, which is four times the size and where the wildlife population has been depleted by poaching.It is us we are waiting for! Africa needs to shape its own conservation and climate agendaRead moreIn a statement, African Parks rejected the suggestion that it had rushed the translocation and said it had been saddened by news of the deaths. It said after further reflection, it would be updating a blog post with information about the translocation and the dangers of conservation work.“Human-wildlife conflict in a country like Malawi is very real and the impact on local people as a result of living in close proximity to dangerous animals like elephants can be significant,” a spokesperson said. “The park management continues to engage with local communities to learn from and improve efforts around human-wildlife conflict mitigation, including implementing an innovative approach to fencing which is proving more successful.“While all parks managed by African Parks in Malawi are fenced, this is not a perfect solution and breakouts of elephants can and do still occur, resulting in a threat to human life and crops.”The prince was not involved in this translocation with African Parks, it is understood.Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features</Text></Article><Article paper="guardian" author="[{'name': 'Staff and agencies in Ouagadougou'}]"><Text>Members of Burkina Faso’s army have seized control of state television, declaring that they had ousted military leader Paul-Henri Damiba, dissolved the government and suspended the constitution and transitional charter.

Damiba took power in a coup in January that ousted democratically elected president Roch Marc Kaboré.Damiba and his allies promised to make the country more secure, but violence has continued unabated and frustration with his leadership has grown in recent months.The statement came after a day of uncertainty, with gunfire ringing out in the capital, Ouagadougou.“In the face of the continuing deterioration of the security situation, we have repeatedly tried to refocus the transition on security issues,” said the statement read aloud on Friday evening by the soldiers. The soldiers promised the international community they would respect their commitments and urged Burkinabes “to go about their business in peace.”Amid growing uncertainties, the UN voiced concern and appealed for calm.“Burkina Faso needs peace, it needs stability, and it needs unity in order to fight terrorist groups and criminal networks operating in parts of the country,” UN spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said.Contagious coups: what is fuelling military takeovers across west Africa?Read moreOn the streets of Ouagadougou, some were showing support for the country’s new leaders.“We are demonstrating to support this coup, confirmed or not,” said Francois Beogo, a political activist from the Movement for the Refounding of Burkina Faso. “For us, it is already a coup.”Beogo said Damiba “has showed his limits” during his short time in power. “People were expecting a real change,” he added.Some demonstrators voiced support for Russian involvement in order to stem the violence, and shouted slogans critical of France, Burkina Faso’s former coloniser. In neighbouring Mali, the junta invited Russian mercenaries from the Wagner Group to help secure the country, though their deployment has drawn international criticism.Last week, Damiba had travelled to New York where he addressed the UN general assembly. In his speech, Damiba defended his January coup as “an issue of survival for our nation”, even if it was “perhaps reprehensible” to the international community. On Thursday, he had given a speech in Djibo, in Burkina Faso’s volatile north.Burkina Faso’s January coup followed similar takeovers in Mali and in Guinea, heightening fears of a rollback of democracy in west Africa. None of the juntas have committed to a date for new elections, though Damiba said last week that the transition in Burkina Faso would last for almost two more years.Many in Burkina Faso initially supported the military takeover, frustrated with the previous government’s inability to stem Islamist violence that has killed thousands and displaced at least 2 million. Yet the violence has failed to wane in the months since Damiba took over. Earlier this month, he also took over the position of defence minister after dismissing a brigadier general from the post.Earlier this week at least 11 soldiers were killed and 50 civilians went missing after a supply convoy was attacked by gunmen in Gaskinde commune in Soum province in the Sahel. That attack was “a low point” for Damiba’s government and “likely played a role in inspiring what we’ve seen so far today”, said Eric Humphery-Smith, senior Africa analyst at risk intelligence company Verisk Maplecroft.Chrysogone Zougmore, president of the Burkina Faso Movement for Human Rights, called Friday’s developments “very regrettable”, saying the instability would not help in the fight against the extremist violence.“How can we hope to unite people and the army if the latter is characterised by such serious divisions?” Zougmore said. “It is time for these reactionary and political military factions to stop leading Burkina Faso adrift.”</Text></Article><Article paper="guardian" author="[{'name': 'Tom Phillips and Andrew Downie in  São Paulo and Ana Ionova in Rio de Janeiro'}]"><Text>Brazil’s acrimonious presidential race will go to a second round after the former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva failed to secure the overall majority he needed to avoid a runoff with the far-right incumbent, Jair Bolsonaro.With more than 99.5% of votes counted the leftist veteran had secured 48.3% of the vote, not enough to avoid the 30 October show down with his rightwing rival. Bolsonaro, who significantly out-performed pollsters’ predictions and will be buoyed by the result, received 43.3%.Addressing the media at a hotel in central São Paulo, Lula, who was president from 2003 until 2010, struck a defiant tone, declaring: “The struggle continues until our final victory.Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva: the former shoe-shine boy hoping to reclaim Brazil’s presidency Read more“We are going to win these elections – this for us is simply extra time,” vowed Lula, who was barred from the 2018 election in which Bolsonaro was elected, on corruption charges that were later overturned.Speaking on the eve of the election Lula said he was hopeful of a first-round win but would redouble his efforts to reclaim power if a second round was needed.“I feel great hope that this election will be decided tomorrow, but if it isn’t we’ll have to behave like a football team when a match goes to extra time. We’ll rest for 15 minutes and then we’ll get back out on to the pitch to score the goals we didn’t score in normal time,” he told reporters.Gleisi Hoffmann, the president of Lula’s Workers’ party, told reporters the campaign was neither “sad or downcast” at the result and pointed to Lula’s more than 56m votes.“Congratulations, president Lula, for your victory,” she declared.But the election result was a major blow to progressive Brazilians who had been rooting for an emphatic victory over Bolsonaro, a former army captain who has repeatedly attacked the country’s democratic institutions and vandalised Brazil’s international reputation.Bolsonaro is also accused of wreaking havoc on the environment and catastrophically mishandling a Covid epidemic that killed nearly 700,000 Brazilians, by undermining vaccination and containment efforts and peddling quack cures.Speaking on Sunday night, Bolsonaro promised to devote more time to convincing the poorest sectors of society they will be better off under a far-right government than a leftist one.The far-right leader said: “I understand there were a lot of votes (cast) because of the condition of the Brazilian people, who feel prices increases, especially basic products. I understand that a lot of people desire change but some changes can be for the worst.”“We tried to show this other side in the campaign but it seems like it didn’t register with the most important layers of society.”He once again said Brazil must avoid following neighbouring nations such as Chile and Colombia who recently elected leftist leaders but he pointedly refused to answer questions about possible voter fraud, after spending months casting aspersions on the security of the electronic voting machines.Bolsonaro has hinted he will not leave office if defeated, raising concerns of a Trump-like insurrection among his supporters if Lula wins.Prominent Bolsonaristas were elected to Brazil’s congress and as state governors, including Bolsonaro’s former health minister, Eduardo Pazuello, who became a congressman for Rio, and his former environment minister Ricardo Salles.Pazuello was Bolsonaro’s health minister during the height of the pandemic that led to more than 685,000 deaths in Brazil. A former military general, he promoted quack cures such as hydroxychloroquine.Salles, meanwhile, was the environment minister who presided over a sharp rise in Amazonian deforestation. A federal police investigation accused the far-right ideologue of making it difficult for environmental crimes to be investigated. A separate inquiry said he was linked to illegal logging exports. He denied all the charges.Rio’s Bolsonaro-supporting governor, Cláudio Castro, was re-elected while one of Bolsonaro’s most controversial former ministers, the evangelical preacher Damares Alves, claimed a place in the senate.Tarcísio de Freitas, Bolsonaro’s candidate for the governorship of São Paulo, also performed better than pollsters predicted and will face Lula ally Fernando Haddad in a second round.“The far-right will be thrilled,” said the political scientist Christian Lynch.Thiago Amparo, an academic and columnist for the Folha de São Paulo newspaper, said the right’s stronger-than-forecast showing showed Bolsonaro and Bolsonarismo were “alive and kicking”.“There was a feeling among the left that Lula had a chance to win in the first round … the results show that it was wishful thinking to imagine the election would serve as a way to punish Bolsonaro for his disastrous policies during the pandemic.”“I feel exhausted,” Amparo added. “But the results show we do not have the time to rest now. It is time to go out on to the streets … otherwise we are going to have a very dark future again.”“I think Bolsonaro has the momentum,” said Thomas Traumann, a Rio de Janeiro-based political observer, although he believed Lula was still the favourite. “It’s a very disappointing night for the left.”There was determination from Lula and his allies as the rightwing successes and the need for a second round became clear.“I think this is a chance that the Brazilian people are giving me,” said Lula before heading to a celebration with his supporters on São Paulo’s Paulista avenue. “The campaign begins tomorrow.”12:29‘Bolsonaro despises humanity’: the trans politician fighting for Brazil's future - video reportIn Rio de Janeiro’s city centre, a massive crowd of people, mostly clad in red, drank beer and danced samba as they awaited the final tally to appear on a screen overlooking the square.But the jubilant mood dampened when results showed Lula still nearly 2% shy of the majority he needed to avoid a runoff duel with Bolsonaro.“I’m disappointed,” said Kharine Gil, a 23-year-old university student. “Because we saw that Bolsonaro is stronger than we thought he was.”Elaine Azevedo, a 34-year-old security systems worker, looked defeated as she stared up at the towering screen showing the results.“I feel despair, pure despair,” said Azevedo, who was clad in red from head to toe and sported a hat with Lula’s name on it. “We all thought Lula would win easily.”But at a neighbourhood bar about a block away, Eudacio Queiroz Alves, a 65-year-old retired driver, was celebrating.“We expected this,” he said. “The people are with Bolsonaro. I’m confident that he will win.”</Text></Article><Article paper="guardian" author="[{'name': 'Tom Phillips in São Paulo'}]"><Text>Brazil’s leftwing former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva appeared on the verge of a startling political comeback on Sunday as more than 156 million Brazilians took part in the country’s most important election in decades.As the veteran ex-president cast his vote in Brazil’s industrial heartlands on Sunday morning, Lula voiced optimism he was heading for victory over the far-right incumbent Jair Bolsonaro.“We want no more hatred, no more quarrelling, we want a country that lives in peace,” the 76-year-old told reporters in São Bernardo do Campo, the city where he began his legendary political career as a unionist in the 1970s.Polls on the eve of the election suggested Lula – who governed from 2003 to 2010 – was tantalisingly close to securing the overall majority of votes he needs to avoid a second-round runoff against Bolsonaro in late October. But by late on Sunday the election appeared to be heading for a run-off on October 30, as Bolsonaro’s strong initial showing seemed to have ended Lula’s hopes of a first-round victory.With 70% of votes counted, Lula was ahead with 45.74% compared to Bolsonaro’s 45.51% – although those numbers were expected to change as votes from traditionally pro-Lula regions were tallied.‘A day of hope’: Lula fans eager to see Bolsonaro defeatedRead moreA Lula victory would represent the latest in a series of triumphs for a resurgent Latin American left, following the election of leftist leaders in Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia and Chile.“I’m going to win these elections so I can give the people the right to be happy again. The people need, deserve and have the right … to be happy once more,” Lula told journalists as he wrapped up his campaigning with a parade through the streets of São Paulo on Saturday.The prospect of a Lula victory has galvanised leftwing and centrist Brazilians after four years under Bolsonaro during which nearly 700,000 people died of Covid and more than 30 million were plunged into poverty and hunger.“I feel hope,” the former president’s biographer and friend Fernando Morais told the Guardian as he prepared to vote wearing a Jeremy Corbyn T-shirt. “I feel like going out and distributing kisses.”Morais considered Lula’s return to power the only way to tackle the intensifying “social tragedy” that was on full show as the writer drove to the polling station in downtown São Paulo.“When you go out at night around here … only 1km from the homes of bankers and big businessmen, you see people freezing to death,” Morais said as he turned into a square where dozens of emaciated people had taken shelter under filthy blankets and in tents. A giant banner hung over the square by anti-Bolsonaro activists read: “Brazil has gotten worse”.“This didn’t exist 10 years ago … It’s like an improvised refugee camp,” Morais said.Brazilian president and re-election candidate Jair Bolsonaro arrives at a polling station to vote in Rio de Janeiro.

We know this is the beginning of a long path. But we want Brazil to at least be able to dream of the future again.”“So many of the advances that took decades to achieve have been destroyed over the last four years,” said his partner, music teacher Mariana Moga de Moura Silva.Sign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterArchie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morningPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This project has lost adhesion and has lost allies precisely because it has failed to improve people’s lives.”Brazil’s election: a last chance to save the Amazon?Read moreBolsonaro’s authoritarian inclinations and relentless questioning of Brazil’s electronic voting system have fuelled concerns he may refuse to accept defeat to Lula. Some fear he may seek to incite turmoil similar to the 6 January invasion of the Capitol in the US if his re-election bid fails, or even a military coup.Trump backed Bolsonaro on the eve of Sunday’s vote with a video message to Brazilians. “He’s done an absolutely incredible job,” Trump claimed, calling Bolsonaro “one of the great presidents of any country in the world”.“I have met many leaders but few as exceptional as President Bolsonaro,” Hungary’s far-right prime minister, Viktor Orbán, said in a video shared on social media by the Brazilian president.Those declarations further fuelled progressive angst over how Bolsonaro and his radical supporters could behave in the coming hours and days.Asked if he would respect the result of Sunday’s election, Bolsonaro turned his back on reporters and walked away.Additional reporting by Ana Ionova in Rio de Janeiro</Text></Article><Article paper="guardian" author="[{'name': 'Tom Phillips in São Paulo and Ana Ionova in Rio de Janeiro'}]"><Text>Gabriela Leoncio has been waiting for the chance to free Brazil from Jair Bolsonaro for four years. On Sunday that chance came.“It’s been a joke-slash-tragedy,” the restaurant host, 29, said of the president’s tumultuous far-right administration as she cast her vote against him in her country’s most important election in decades.Leoncio, who was sporting a bright red T-shirt, cap and earrings celebrating the leftwing frontrunner, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, said she was optimistic her candidate would prevail when 156 million Brazilians chose their new leader.“One phase is coming to an end and another phase, of change and hope, is beginning,” she enthused as voters filed into the polling station near Augusta Street in São Paulo, where Lula had held his final campaign event the previous afternoon.Gabriela Leoncio said she had been waiting four years to vote out Bolsonaro. Photograph: Tom Phillips/The GuardianOther voters voiced similar confidence that Bolsonaro’s presidency, during which Amazon devastation skyrocketed, millions were plunged into poverty and Covid killed more than 685,000 Brazilians, was finally coming to an end.“Today is a day of hope,” said Eduardo Horderle Peruzzo, 35, a historian, after casting his vote for Lula.Mariana Moga de Moura Silva, 38, a singing teacher, came wearing a sticker featuring Lula’s portrait and slogan: “Hope will defeat fear”.She voiced disgust at the “vile words” Bolsonaro has used to describe women and perplexity that many continued to support the rightwing populist who retains the support of about a third of voters. “I feel a mix of nausea and anger when I hear him speak,” she said.She was convinced Lula would emerge victorious when the results are announced on Sunday evening, but polls suggest the election is on a knife-edge.Eduardo Horderle Peruzzo and Mariana Moga de Moura Silva after casting their votes for Lula in São Paulo. Photograph: Tom Phillips/The GuardianLula has the support of between 50% and 51% of voters, meaning he is tantalisingly close to securing the overall majority of votes he needs to avoid a 30 October run-off with Bolsonaro, whom the polls give 36% or 37%. But observers believe it is possible Lula will fall just short.“If someone tells you they know what’s going to happen … they’re either a trickster or they don’t know what’s going on,” said Fábio Victor, the author of a book about the politics of Brazil’s armed forces.Lula, who was Brazil’s president from 2003 to 2010, insisted on the eve of the vote that he was confident of winning outright but would hit the streets to celebrate even if a second round was needed in four weeks’ time.“I feel great hope that this election will be decided tomorrow, but if it isn’t we’ll have to behave like a football team when a match goes to extra time. We’ll rest for 15 minutes and then we’ll get back out onto the pitch to score the goals we didn’t score in normal time,” he told reporters.Lula greets a supporter after casting his vote at a polling station in São Paulo. Photograph: Sebastião Moreira/EPAEarlier in the day thousands of elated Lula supporters packed onto Augusta Street to catch a glimpse of their leader and toast the astonishing political revival of a politician who only three years ago was in jail on corruption charges that were later quashed.“He is the exit route from the nightmare we are living through,” said Juliano Medeiros, the president of the Socialism and Liberty party (PSOL), one of the leftist groups in Lula’s coalition.João dos Santos, 56, an activist from the Front for the Struggle for Housing, said he was convinced Bolsonaro’s days were numbered. “He belongs to the past and he will go down in history as the worst president the world has ever seen, a genocidal being who thinks only of himself and his family.”Danilo Lima, 45, an electrician, accused Bolsonaro of plunging Latin America’s biggest democracy into political chaos and international isolation. “Brazil is a brothel without a pimp. This nonsense has to stop,” he said. “Any Brazilian who votes for Bolsonaro has worms in their head.”Yet many citizens do continue to support the far-right radical, who has insisted he would win on Sunday despite all major polling firms predicting his defeat.A Bolsonaro supporter heads to the polls in Brasilia.

Even wealthy members of the agricultural sector, one of the president’s key support bases, were abandoning a politician known for his foul-mouthed tirades and divisive rhetoric.“I have relatives linked to agribusiness who were radically against Lula and are going to vote for Lula now,” the writer said.

When the hammer fell the vase had been sold for €7.7m – almost 4,000 times its estimated value. With the seller’s fees, the final purchase price was €9.12m.The tianqiuping-style porcelain was put in the auction by a woman living in a French overseas territory who was left it by her late mother. The unnamed seller had not seen the 54cm-tall vase, but arranged for it to be taken from her mother’s home in Brittany to Paris to be sold by auctioneers Osenat.She told the auction house expert the vase had originally belonged to her grandmother, a Parisian collector.Paris mansion’s contents at auction in house clearance par excellenceRead moreAlmost 30 would-be buyers competed in the bidding war.Jean-Pierre Osenat of the auctioneers said it was a “crazy story”. “The seller lives far away and didn’t even see the vase. She inherited it from her mother who in turn inherited it from her mother who was a big Paris collector in the last century,” Osenat said.Tianqiuping means “heavenly sphere” and denotes the shape of the vase, which was blue and white porcelain covered in enamel and decorated with dragons and clouds. The auction house said it dated from the 20th century and described it as “quite ordinary”. Had it been 200 years older it would have been extremely rare, their expert said.Cédric Laborde, a director at Osenat, said: “From the moment the catalogue was published we saw there was enormous interest with more and more Chinese people coming to see the vase.

Three witnesses told the Guardian teargas was fired not only at fans on the pitch but also at crowds who had remained in the stands, and that no warning was given.Huge numbers scrambled to escape, prompting a deadly rush in which many were suffocated or crushed. A further 323 people were injured, some of whom are in critical condition. At least 32 children were among those killed. The youngest was aged three or four, according to an official.“I held out in the stands even as the gas strangled my throat,” said one fan who struggled to leave because the exit was packed with people. In my 20 years as an [Arema fan], I have never felt as terrified as I did that night.”Fifa stadium safety guidance states that “crowd control gas” should not be carried or used by stewards or police inside stadiums.‘I felt terrified’: fans tell how Indonesian stadium disaster unfoldedRead moreIndonesia’s chief security minister, Mahfud MD, said on Monday an independent fact-finding team would be formed to investigate the disaster.Separately, a national police spokesperson, Dedy Prasetyo, said 18 officers responsible for firing teargas, ranging from middle- to high-ranking, were being investigated along with “internal matters related to security management”. Witnesses were being questioned and mobile phone and security camera footage examined, he added.Rights experts have demanded that any inquiry be fully impartial.Phil Robertson, the deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch, called for the president, Joko Widodo, to establish an independent investigation, and publicly report the findings.“All those responsible should be held accountable for this disaster, regardless of their status or position. It’s not enough for the national police and the Football Association of Indonesia to conduct their own investigation because they may be tempted to downplay or undermine full accountability for officials involved,” he said.Fifa should also conduct an investigation and issue a public report of its findings, Robertson added.Said Usman Hamid, the executive director of Amnesty International Indonesia, has also called for an inquiry, claiming “excessive force” had been used.Damaged vehicles in the Kanjuruhan stadium after the fatal crush. Photograph: Willy Kurniawan/ReutersEast Java’s police chief, Nico Afinta, defended the force’s response at a news conference on Sunday. He said other measures had been taken before teargas was used but that fans “began to attack the police, acting anarchically and burning vehicles”.A vigil was held outside the Kanjuruhan stadium on Sunday evening to remember the victims. Graffiti on the walls of the stadium revealed deep anger towards the authorities.“My siblings were killed. Investigate thoroughly,” read one message scrawled on the stadium’s shutters, accompanied by a black ribbon and the date of the tragedy, according to the news company Agence France-Presse. “ACAB”, an abbreviation for “all cops are bastards”, was sprayed on another wall.Funerals were also held for victims. “My family and I didn’t think it would turn out like this,” Endah Wahyuni told Reuters. Her two younger brothers, Ahmad Cahyo, 15, and Muhammad Farel, 14, were among those killed. “They loved soccer but never watched Arema live at Kanjuruhan stadium. This was their first time,” she said.Social media footage from inside the stadium showed chaotic scenes in which fans clambered to escape large amounts of teargas, some trying to carry other injured spectators to safety.Only fans of Arema, the home side, were allowed to watch Saturday night’s match. Fans of the opposing team, Persebaya Surabaya, who won, were banned as a precaution to prevent violence between the two sides.Indonesia has a long-running problem with football violence, fuelled by intense rivalry between teams. However previous incidents have not been anywhere near as deadly as Saturday’s tragedy, which is one of the worst sports stadium disasters ever.The Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, called the events “a dark day for all involved in football and a tragedy beyond comprehension”. Football teams around the world offered condolences, including Manchester United and Barcelona, while Real Madrid held a one-minute silence before their game on Sunday.Football supporters pray at the Jatidiri Stadium in Semarang.

Liu has always denied the assault accusations, saying it was consensual.In 2019, Liu Jingyao – who is not related but shares a common name – launched civil proceedings against Liu, after prosecutors declined to pursue a criminal case. The case has been followed by Chinese people. But on the eve of the Minneapolis trial, lawyers for both parties announced they had reached a settlement. A settlement amount was not disclosed.“The incident between Ms Liu Jingyao and Mr Liu Richard in Minnesota in 2018 resulted in a misunderstanding that has consumed substantial public attention and brought profound suffering to the parties and their families,” it said.The shock announcement brought to a close a case that had captured the attention of Chinese citizens and media, aided by the US court system’s far more open access than the notoriously opaque Chinese court system.In 2018 Liu Jingyao claimed she had been at a dinner with Liu, the CEO of e-retail giant JD.com, and other executives, and was put under pressure to drink alcohol. She accused Liu of later forcing himself on her in a car when she was too intoxicated to resist, and then following her to her room and raping her. The next day she called police, who arrested Liu.The case made global headlines, but Liu denied wrongdoing and was released the next day. Prosecutors later declined to press charges citing “profound evidentiary problems”. In April the following year, Liu Jingyao launched civil proceedings against him.The accusations and pending civil suit, scheduled to begin on Monday, had divided opinions over the years. China’s #MeToo movement has struggled to gain traction in the fact of social stigma, official censorship, uneven power dynamics, and significant obstacles in victims getting their case before a court. In recent years unsuccessful accusations against high-profile men have appeared to undermine confidence in government pledges to improve the protection of women.Liu and his wife, a celebrity influencer, were famous and drew support in the face of the allegations. Chinese media reports had seized upon edited CCTV footage of the pair’s encounter, to discredit Liu Jingyao’s account and suggest that she had invited the executive to her room. She was subject to widespread accusations of seducing Liu, and lying in order to make money. There was also a debate over societal favouring of powerful elites, dangerous drinking cultures, and demands for a “perfect victim”.News of the settlement quickly spread across social media in China, with hundreds of millions of views of related hashtags on Weibo. “The public has seen the essence of the matter,” said one. “Money is all-powerful.”Some #MeToo supporters praised Liu Jingyao for continuing her fight for four years. “Every battle flag is precious,” said one.A group of Chinese women’s rights activists who had followed the case, sharing information with people in China, said the settlement was of great importance to the movement, and a “common victory”.“Jingyao decided this case had way more details to be revealed through the [legal] process and she was willing to take it to court,” said Gigi, a US-based member of the group.“It was thanks to the courage of her that we get to know so much more detail and do more public education and allow people to know more about one of the most high profile #MeToo cases in China … [and] to have the opportunity to maybe get a trial, where you can have tremendous open access to court documents on the website, which reveals so much of how those typical toxic drinking cultures and business cultures.“With so many #MeToo survivors coming forward, we can humanise the cases, we see them, and they don’t need to be the perfect victim. We have come a long way.”Liu Jingyao, who has previously told the New York Times she was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder following the alleged incident, on Sunday told the paper she was “OK”. “I didn’t make it to the end but that was all I could do,” the NYT reported her as saying.On Sunday, Liu released a statement. “I want to once again express my regrets to all those troubled by this incident, especially my wife, and I hope my life and work can return to normal as soon as possible,” he said.

Two police officers were among the dead.Many people were crushed and suffocated when they ran to one exit, Afinta said.“They went out to one point at the exit, then there was a buildup – in the process of accumulation there was shortness of breath, lack of oxygen.”A hospital director told local TV that one victim was aged five.“The most terrible thing was when victims came to be treated by the team doctor,” said Arema coach Javier Roca. “About 20 people arrived and four died. Fans died in the arms of players.”Officials earlier said the death toll had been 174, but revised this figure down on Sunday evening, saying they had cross-referenced data from 10 hospitals. A further 320 people were injured.The Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, called the events “a dark day for all involved in football and a tragedy beyond comprehension”.“The football world is in a state of shock,” he said. Manchester United and Barcelona posted tributes online and other Spanish football clubs said they would hold a minute’s silence before their matches on Sunday.The Indonesian president, Joko Widodo, told authorities to thoroughly re-evaluate security at football matches and ordered the suspension of Liga 1 matches. Saturday’s events should be the “last soccer tragedy in the nation”, he said.Social media footage and images showed chaotic scenes in which fans clambered to escape thick clouds of teargas, some trying to carry other injured spectators to safety.Rights experts have demanded answers over the police response, pointing to Fifa stadium safety guidance that states that “crowd control gas” should not be carried or used by stewards or police around the perimeter of the field of play.Amnesty International’s executive director for Indonesia, Usman Hamid, said this loss of life “cannot go unanswered” and called on the authorities to “ensure that those who are found to have committed violations are tried in open court and do not merely receive internal or administrative sanctions”.Police and soldiers on the stadium’s pitch after teargas was fired. Photograph: Yudha Prabowo/APTeargas should only be used to disperse crowds when widespread violence had occurred and when other methods had failed, and people had to be warned of its use and allowed to disperse, Amnesty said.Questions have also been raised over why the venue was filled beyond its capacity. Indonesia’s chief security minister, Mahfud MD, said in an Instagram post on Sunday that 42,000 tickets had been issued for a stadium that holds a maximum of 38,000 people.East Java’s police chief, Nico Afinta, defended the force’s response at a news conference on Sunday. He said other measures had been taken before teargas was used but that fans “began to attack the police, acting anarchically and burning vehicles”.Local reports said as many as 3,000 spectators had stormed the pitch. Further clashes occurred outside the stadium, with vehicles, including a police truck, torched.Relatives waited anxiously for news about their loved ones at Malang’s Saiful Anwar general hospital. Others tried to identify the bodies at a morgue.At the Vatican, Pope Francis said he was praying for “all those who have lost their lives and were injured in the clashes”.A group of people carry a man in the stadium during the melee. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images The Indonesian government apologised for the disaster and promised to investigate its circumstances.“We’re sorry for this incident ... this is a regrettable incident that ‘injures’ our football at a time when supporters can watch football matches from the stadium,” the Indonesian sports and youth minister, Zainudin Amali, told broadcaster Kompas.“We will thoroughly evaluate the organisation of the match and the attendance of supporters. Will we return to banning supporters from attending the matches? That is what we will discuss.”MapPersebaya Surabaya fans were not allowed to buy tickets for the game due to fears of violence between fans of the longstanding rivals.Mahfud MD said organisers ignored the recommendation of authorities to hold the match in the afternoon instead of the evening.“This sport … often provokes supporters to express emotions suddenly,” he said on Instagram.Violence between football fans is a long-running problem in Indonesia. Seventy-eight people have died in football-related accidents over the past 28 years, according to government figures given to Channel News Asia in June.A torched car outside the stadium after the chaos. Photograph: Putri/AFP/Getty ImagesAkhmad Hadian Lukita, the president director of PT Liga Indonesia Baru expressed deep regret over the events, saying: “We share our condolences and hopefully this will be a valuable lesson for all of us.”The Indonesian football association (PSSI) said it would investigate what happened. “We announced the decision [to suspend the league] after we received a direction from the chairman of PSSI,” Akhmad Hadian said. “We are doing this to respect everything and while waiting for the investigation process from PSSI.”Some of the worst other stadium disasters include a 1989 crush at Hillsborough in the UK, which led to the deaths of 97 Liverpool fans, and the 2012 Port Said stadium tragedy in Egypt where 74 people died in clashes.In 1964, 320 people were killed and more than 1,000 injured during a crowd crush at a Peru-Argentina Olympic qualifier at Lima’s national stadium.Reuters and Agence France-Presse contributed to this

as Seoul, Tokyo and Washington ramp up joint military drills.The launch early on Saturday came after the navies of South Korea, the United States and Japan staged trilateral anti-submarine exercises on Friday for the first time in five years, and the US vice-president, Kamala Harris, made a visit to the region this week.Harris was in Seoul on Thursday and toured the heavily fortified demilitarised zone that divides the peninsula, on a trip that aimed to underscore her country’s “ironclad” commitment to South Korea’s defence against the North.Kamala Harris hits out at North Korea’s ‘provocative nuclear rhetoric’ on DMZ visitRead moreWith inter-Korean talks long stalled, Pyongyang has doubled down on its banned weapons programmes, conducting a record-breaking blitz of tests this year and revising its laws to declare itself an “irreversible” nuclear power.South Korea’s military said it had “detected two short-range missiles between 0645 and 0703 fired from the Sunan area in Pyongyang into the East Sea”, referring to the body of water also known as the Sea of Japan.The missiles “flew approximately 350km at an altitude of 30km at speed of Mach 6”, Seoul’s joint chiefs of staff said in a statement, calling the launches “a serious provocation”.Tokyo also confirmed the launch, saying the missiles had landed outside Japan’s exclusive economic zones.Toshiro Ino, Japan’s vice defence minister, said the missiles “appear to have flown in irregular trajectories”.Experts say the irregular trajectories indicate the missiles are capable of manoeuvring in flight, making them harder to track and intercept.The US Indo-Pacific Command said in a statement that the latest launch “highlights the destabilising impact of the DPRK’s unlawful WMD and ballistic missile programs”, using the official abbreviation for North Korea.North Korea marked Harris’s trip to Seoul with a flurry of missile launches – firing off short-range ballistic missiles on Sunday, Wednesday and Thursday, including a few hours after the vice-president flew out of South Korea.Washington has about 28,500 troops stationed in South Korea to help protect it from the North.Under Seoul’s President Yoon Suk-yeol, who took office in May, the two countries have boosted joint exercises, which they insist are purely defensive.North Korea fires ballistic missile towards sea, says South Korean militaryRead moreJust before Harris arrived in Seoul, Washington sent the nuclear-powered USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier to South Korea to conduct a large-scale joint naval exercise.Such drills infuriate North Korea, which sees them as rehearsals for an invasion.“North Korea’s short-range ballistic tests are less important than a nuclear test but still violate UN security council resolutions,” said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul, adding that the timing was “provocative”.North Korea was “rapidly modernising weapons and taking advantage of a world divided by US-China rivalry and Russia’s annexation of more Ukrainian territory”, he said.South Korean and US officials have been warning for months that the North Korean ruler, Kim Jong-un, is preparing to conduct another nuclear test.On Wednesday, the South’s spy agency said North Korea’s next nuclear test could happen in the window between China’s upcoming party congress on 16 October and the US midterm elections on 7 November.North Korea, which is under multiple UN sanctions for its weapons programmes, typically seeks to maximise the geopolitical impact of its tests with careful timing.The isolated regime has tested nuclear weapons six times since 2006, most recently in 2017.</Text></Article><Article paper="guardian" author="[{'name': 'Jim Waterson Media

raised concerns that the Vietnamese state had a history of abducting journalists from Thailand. They also suggested that BBC bosses failed to comprehend that just because both countries were in south-east Asia, it did not mean Vietnamese people were naturally at home in Thailand.“Being a critic of the Vietnamese government, even when you’re in Thailand, is not safe,” said one World Service employee. Journalists in Thailand have to annually submit their articles to the government to have their visas renewed.Journalists cannot operate freely in Vietnam, a one-party state controlled by the country’s Communist party. As a result, most of the BBC’s Vietnamese-language staff have traditionally operated out of London, in common with the majority of the World Service’s operations.A BBC spokesperson said: “The safety and security of our journalists is paramount. We are not proposing to open any new operations in Bangkok – for a number of years the Vietnamese service has been split between Bangkok and London, with half of the journalists based in Bangkok and half in London, all producing excellent and impartial journalism.”The relocation of the London-based Vietnamese team is one of a series of cost-saving measures announced on Thursday, which includes cutting almost 400 jobs to save the BBC about £28m a year. The Thai service will also move from London to Bangkok, the Korean service to Seoul, and the Bangla service to Dhaka.One employee said: “The BBC want to use the World Service as a token in the game about the licence fee with the government.”Bill Hayton, a former BBC Vietnam correspondent, said the relocation would result in a loss of institutional knowledge: “It’s about cost saving – you can hire people in Thailand on local rates. Vietnamese dissidents have been kidnapped in Bangkok by Vietnamese security forces and that must weigh on the heads of anyone doing Vietnamese journalism in Thailand. That presents a risk to BBC journalism, as well as the BBC journalists involved.”There is a tension within the BBC World Service: one viewpoint is that journalists should be based in the same countries as their audience, the other is that the purpose of the World Service is to provide global audiences with news from London.The BBC argues that it should focus on producing online content that reaches younger global audiences rather than trying to find ways to maintain its overseas radio and television output.The World Service was traditionally funded by the British government as a tool of soft power, but the cost was loaded on to British licence fee payers as part of George Osborne’s austerity measures. The government has since started providing some funding again but the latest cuts have raised concerns that the UK is ceding the foreign broadcast space to state-backed competitors, such as Russia’s RT and China’s CGTN.</Text></Article><Article paper="guardian" author="[{'name': 'Ben Doherty and Nino Bucci'}]"><Text>A lawyer for Australians trapped in Syrian detention camps say conditions are “volatile and unsafe” inside the camps as winter approaches, with interruptions to food and water supply, and the need for their repatriation growing increasingly urgent.Guardian Australia reported on Sunday that the government was preparing an operation to start repatriating more than 60 Australians – widows and children of slain or jailed Islamic State fighters – who are in the al-Hawl and Roj detention camps. About 20 are adults, many of whom say they were coerced or tricked into travelling to Syria by husbands who have since died.Most of the more than 40 children are under the age of six. Several were born in the detention camps.Between 20 and 30 people are expected to be repatriated initially, with subsequent operations expected in the coming months. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Kamalle Dabboussy, whose daughter Mariam and her three children are in the Roj camp in Syria’s north-east, said: “It’s every parent’s wish to ensure their children are safe.”“The welfare of these children is paramount, so it’s important that every Australian woman and child is brought home.”Dabboussy said family members had not been notified by the government it was planning to repatriate women and children, “but it would be an incredibly exciting prospect”.“The families just want to welcome them home and would happily cooperate with all levels of government to make that happen,” he said. The news that a rescue mission was planned was consistent with recent discussions between family representatives and Australian authorities.Australian children rescued from Syrian camps need tailored support to reintegrate into society, expert saysRead moreSarah Condon, a Robinson Gill lawyer representing a cohort of families from Melbourne who make up roughly half of the Australians, said she had yet to be informed by authorities about the planned repatriation.She told Guardian Australia that while she was not in a position to comment on individual cases, all Australians detained in both camps should be repatriated urgently.“The conditions in the camp remain volatile and unsafe, and continue to fluctuate from one day to the next,” Condon said, adding there had been reports of interruptions to food and water supplies.She said the families remain committed to cooperating with authorities upon their return.“The expectation that justice be done requires due process, and an examination of what, if any, evidence exists,” she said. “The authorities – and courts, if required – should be left to that task.”Condon said the comments made by shadow home affairs minister Karen Andrews describing the repatriations as “very concerning” demonstrated a lack of understanding about the dangers facing the women and children in the camp.“Following the tragic and entirely preventable death of Yusuf Zahab, a detained child – we know that the risk to Australian life is not far-fetched or fanciful.“Karen Andrews’ comments this morning – effectively proposing the facilitation of indefinite and uncharged detention, and the slow-motion death of Australian women and children – is not an option that is consistent with the government’s obligations to Australian citizens.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In 2019, Australia launched a secret rescue mission to repatriate eight orphans, including a pregnant teenager, from the camps.

The conditions in the camps are horrible – poor sanitation, overcrowded, filthy and inhumane.“Children who lived under IS and women trafficked by IS should be treated first and foremost as victims. Others could be investigated and prosecuted under Australian law, which is at least some measure of accountability.”Australia to launch rescue mission for women and children trapped in Syrian detention campsRead moreThe chief executive of Save the Children Australia, Mat Tinkler, visited the camps in June and said he was encouraged by the reports of a repatriation plan.“For more than three years, these children have been trapped in one of the worst places in the world to be a child and their situation has been growing increasingly desperate,” he said.Tinkler rejected arguments repatriation was impractical or too dangerous.“That excuse was always rubbish,” he said, citing his own visit to Roj camp. “It’s not complicated. If a bloke from the west of Melbourne can get there on his own, then surely the Australian government, with all of its resources and capabilities, and the support of the US military, can.”He said it was in Australia’s national security interests to bring the women and children home sooner rather than later, and under government supervision and control, given as citizens they would ultimately have the right to return anyway. The women in Roj camp have volunteered to be subject to government control orders if they are returned.</Text></Article><Article paper="guardian" author="[{'name': 'Nino Bucci'}]"><Text>A psychologist has found that a 13-year-old Victorian boy charged with murder could be tried for the crime, saying that his respect for “gang members” and “adherence to an alternative moral code” shows he has the mental capacity to understand right from wrong.The boy, who cannot be named, is one of eight teenagers charged over the murder of Declan Cutler.Cutler was killed in Reservoir, in Melbourne’s north, on 13 March.The teenagers accused of his murder are facing a committal hearing in the Melbourne children’s court this week. The hearing will determine if there is enough evidence for the accused to face trial.Lawyers for the 13-year-old, the youngest of those charged, spent much of Monday’s hearing questioning a psychologist who completed a report on behalf of the prosecution in relation to their client. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning  The psychologist did not interview the boy to compile her report, which sought to address whether he had the mental capacity to know that what he was accused of doing was wrong, known as the doli incapax principle. Those aged between 10 and 14 in Victoria at the time of their alleged offending cannot be prosecuted if a court finds that principle is upheld.The court heard that a previous doli incapax report, completed by a different psychologist in July 2021 in relation to other alleged offending committed by the boy, found he did not have this capacity.Police had withdrawn the previous charges against the boy after receiving this report, the court heard.But the psychologist who completed the recent report found otherwise.She said that several factors, including his lack of appreciation of how his alleged offending harmed others, and his attempts to avoid self-incrimination and attitudes towards police, contributed to her findings.For example, she said, when he was questioned by police about a car theft and asked how he would feel if someone had stolen his car, he responded that they could take a bus.Sign up to Guardian Australia's Morning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing email breaks down the key national and international stories of the day and why they matterPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Windows and windscreens were smashed in.The BBC saw half a dozen bodies lying at the scene, apparently civilians. Baggage and coats strewed the tarmac. One survivor told the BBC her boss had been killed in the attack."She had two kids. I left the cafe to use the restroom when it happened. I ran back and tried to find her. The cafe was demolished, there were many bodies around. It was all so very horrifying," Viktoriia Yosypenko said.Reacting to the attack in the early hours of Friday on the outskirts of the regional capital of the Zaporizhzhia region, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia was a "state-terrorist".He said Russia launched 16 rockets on the city, and vowed to punish perpetrators for "every lost Ukrainian life".Meanwhile, a Russian-installed local official blamed Ukraine for the attack.The convoy was hit as people were preparing to travel to the Russian-occupied part of the region to pick up their relatives and also deliver humanitarian aid.Tears and despair as Russian annexation loomsNear the missile's impact crater, the BBC spoke to Kateryna Holoborod, sat on her suitcase in a state of shock. 'We arrived in a line, to join a column going towards Kherson," she said. "We got out to see what number we had in the queue. Then the first rocket hit, behind the wagons. "We dropped to the ground. Then the second one hit in the centre of the queue. There was glass everywhere, people screaming and running. I don't remember much. "It was very scary. I then got up to see what happened, help the injured. I tried to help an injured young man when the third explosion happened."The attack comes as Russian President Vladimir Putin is preparing for a signing ceremony in Moscow to annex Zaporizhzhia along with Ukraine's Donetsk, Luhansk and Kherson regions.The move follows self-styled referendums in the eastern and southern regions, which have been condemned by Ukraine and the West as a sham.Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February, and Moscow currently controls the majority of the Zaporizhzhia region, including Europe's biggest nuclear power plant there - but not the regional capital.Moscow-installed regional official Vladimir Rogov blamed "Ukrainian militants" for the Zaporizhzhia attack, Russian state-run media reported.In a separate development, one person was killed and five injured in overnight Russian strikes by Iskander missiles on the central city of Dnipro, about 70km (43 miles) north of Zaporizhzhia, local officials said.They said a transport company was targeted, and as many as 52 buses were burnt and another 98 damaged.Several high-rise buildings, offices and a shop were also hit.You may also be interested in: </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Raffi Berg"><Text>About 20 members of a Jewish sect held at a facility in Mexico after a police raid on their jungle base have fled.Footage showed men, women, and children streaming out of the site in Huixtla, in the west, on Wednesday night.They had been there since the raid last Friday when two members were arrested on suspicion of human trafficking and serious sexual offences.The sect, Lev Tahor, is known for extremist practices and imposing a strict regime on its followers.It advocates child marriage, inflicts harsh punishments even for minor transgressions and requires women and girls as young as three years old to completely cover up with robes.Local media said members of the group had been protesting against their detention since their arrival, including rioting and assaulting personnel.Video from Reuters news agency shows the detainees, dressed in gold, grey and white robes, forcing their way past two guards at a gate as one of their members holds it open.One of the guards trying to hold them back falls down and the group climb over him as they make their escape. A youth is seen turning and kicking the guard as he lies on the ground.  It is unclear where the group has gone. Associated Press said they were collected by a lorry and headed towards the border with Guatemala, while news site El Heraldo de México said they went by foot for several miles before disappearing into the night.Their compound, 11 miles (17.5km) north of Tapachula in Chiapas state, was raided by an elite police unit after a months-long investigation and surveillance operation involving Mexican and Guatemalan authorities and a private four-man team from Israel including former Mossad and domestic intelligence agents.Twenty-six members were found at the site, among them Israelis with dual citizenships including Canada, the US and Guatemala, Israel's foreign ministry said.It said a Canadian and an Israeli citizen were arrested, while two other wanted members reportedly left the compound two days before the raid and are being sought. Five more were detained for allegedly breaking immigration rules.The operation stemmed from an appeal to a former member of Israel's domestic intelligence agency, Shin Bet, by a former member of the sect, Yisrael Amir.Mr Amir fled the group's base in Guatemala in 2020, having to leave his then one-year-old son there.His son was released in the raid last week and flown back to Israel with his father.The group had lived in Guatemala since 2014, but in January members illegally crossed into Mexico, settling in the jungle. The leadership in Guatemala has been at the centre of a kidnapping case since 2018. Nine of the sect's members have been charged, four of whom have so far been convicted. Lev Tahor - Hebrew for Pure of Heart - was formed in Israel in 1988 and is thought to number up to 350 members, according to an ex-members group.It has been forced to move from country to country in recent years after coming under scrutiny from local authorities. It is currently spread between Israel, the US, North Macedonia, Morocco, Mexico and Guatemala. Between 70 and 80 members are still in Guatemala.While the group is often described as ultra-Orthodox, it follows its own sets of rules and has been declared a "dangerous cult" by an Israeli court.Its leaders have denied breaking local laws and say the group is being targeted because of its beliefs.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="BBC News, author unspecified"><Text>The European Union has agreed to impose emergency measures to charge energy firms on their record profits.Ministers have agreed windfall taxes on certain energy companies as well as mandatory cuts in electricity use.The plan includes a levy on fossil fuel firms' surplus profits and a levy on excess revenues made from surging electricity costs. The cash raised is expected to go to families and businesses.But the bloc is divided on whether and how to cap the wholesale price of gas.It comes as Europe braces itself for a difficult winter due to the cost of living crisis and squeeze on global energy supplies.What is the windfall tax on oil and gas companies?Germany vows €65bn package to combat energy crisisThe bloc is largely trying to wean itself off Russia energy but it has left it scrambling for other alternative, expensive, sources.A windfall tax is imposed by a government on a company to target firms that were lucky enough to benefit from something they were not responsible for - in other words, a windfall profit. Energy firms are getting much more money for their oil and gas than they were last year, partly because demand has increased as the world emerges from the pandemic and more recently because of supply concerns due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.EU ministers estimate that they can raise €140bn (£123bn) from the levies on non-gas electricity producers and suppliers that are making larger-than-usual profits from the current demand.Earlier this month, the European Commission's vice-president, Frans Timmermans, said that fossil fuel extractors will be told to give back 33% of their surplus profits for this year. "The era of cheap fossil fuels is over. And the faster we move to cheap, clean and homegrown renewables, the sooner we will be immune to Russia's energy blackmail," he said."A cap on outsize revenues will bring solidarity from energy companies with abnormally high profits towards their struggling customers," he added. Earlier this week, 15 member states, including France and Italy, asked the EU to impose a price cap on gas bills to slow the soaring costs. A decision has not yet been announced on a price cap. "There is big disappointment that in the proposal that is on the table there is nothing about gas prices," Polish climate minister Anna Moskwa said.Ms Moskwa said a maximum price for gas would be supported by the majority of European countries and "cannot be ignored". In the UK, former Chancellor Rishi Sunak introduced a similar tax to Friday's EU agreement in May, which he called the Energy Profits Levy.It was applied to profits made by companies from extracting UK oil and gas, but not those that generate electricity from sources such as nuclear or wind power. </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="BBC News, author unspecified"><Text>A suicide attack at a tuition centre in the Afghan capital Kabul has killed at least 19 people, most of them female students, police and witnesses say.Nearly 30 others were wounded at the Kaaj education centre in the Dasht-e-Barchi area in the west of the city.Students had been sitting a practice university exam when the bomber struck. No group has yet claimed the attack.Many of those in the area are minority Hazaras, who have often been targeted by Islamic State (IS) militants.Footage on local TV and shared on social media appeared to show scenes from a nearby hospital, where rows of covered bodies were laid out on the floor. Other media reportedly from the site of the private college showed rubble and upturned tables in the damaged classrooms."We didn't find her here," a woman who was looking for her sister at one of the hospitals told AFP news agency. "She was 19 years old." Some reports say the number of dead is far higher than Taliban officials have acknowledged. The attacker is reported to have shot at the guards outside the centre, entered a classroom and detonated a bomb.Eyewitnesses told the BBC that most of the victims were girls - they were seated in the front row, near the blast. A student who was wounded told AFP that there were around 600 people in the room when the attack happened. The Kaaj tuition centre is a private college which teaches both male and female students. Most girls' schools in the country have been closed since the Taliban returned to power in August last year, but some private schools are open.Hazaras, most of whom are Shia Muslims, are Afghanistan's third largest ethnic group.

The attack was also strongly condemned by the United Nations and the US. "Targeting a room full of students taking exams is shameful; all students should be able to pursue an education in peace and without fear," said Karen Decker, charge d'affaires at the US mission to Afghanistan, in a tweet. The security situation in Afghanistan, which had improved after the end of fighting following the Taliban takeover, has been deteriorating in recent months, with a number of attacks on civilians but also Taliban supporters. Some have been claimed by IS, which is a bitter rival of the Taliban.Schools and hospitals have been targeted in the Dasht-e-Barchi area in a series of attacks, most of which are thought to have been the work of IS.Last year - before the Taliban returned to power - a bomb attack on a girls school in Dasht-e-Barchi killed at least 85 people, mainly students, and wounded hundreds more.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Flora Drury"><Text>A rights group has called on Fifa to ban Iran from this year's World Cup after blocking women from watching games in their own country.Open Stadiums questioned why the country was being allowed to compete while "Iranian women remain locked out of our 'Beautiful Game'" by officials.The call comes weeks after women were allowed to attend a domestic match for the first time since 1979.However, the rights group was sceptical stadiums would remain open to women."Iranian women trust neither the Islamic Republic's authorities nor the Iranian Football Federation that the Azadi stadium will remain open to them after the Fifa World Cup 2022 concludes on December 18," Open Stadiums said in an open letter to Fifa's president, Gianni Infantino.It also argues that even those who travel to Qatar to watch matches risk falling foul of Iranian authorities, with fears state spies may keep tabs on those who attend.Prohibiting women from games goes against international football rules, the letter points out, arguing Fifa should "immediately expel Iran from the World Cup 2022 in Qatar" as a result.What happens when sport and politics collide in IranIranian news sites reported speculation that women were allowed to attend the match in August after Fifa sent a letter to authorities calling on them to permit more women into stadiums. Fifa has previously told the BBC it would not "turn its eyes" away from the issue.There is no official ban on women going to sporting events in Iran, but it is rare as they are often refused entry.Prior to this, women had effectively been barred from domestic matches where men are playing due to clerical disapproval under the Shia Muslim regime. Women have attended a handful of international matches, including one in March this year, news agency Reuters reports.The rights group, which campaigns for equal access to sport in Iran, also claimed in the letter that members of the football team going to Qatar later this year had been banned from speaking out over deadly protests currently rocking the country. They were sparked by the death in custody of a young woman, Mahsa Amini, after she was detained morality police.The letter points out that the detention centre where she died is the same one "where female fans are usually brought to and tortured if we dare to try to attend a football game".Neither the Iranian football association or Fifa have responded to a request for comment from Reuters.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Christy Cooney"><Text>Comedian Trevor Noah has announced he is standing down as host of The Daily Show.

Noah began his career in his native South Africa, releasing a string of stand-up specials and hosting a late-night talk show before relocating to the US in 2011. He was still a relative unknown when he was chosen to take over the Daily Show on the Comedy Central network, but has since become an internationally-recognised star and won numerous television awards. Noah made the announcement at the end of his show on Thursday night, prompting shocked gasps from the studio audience.He thanked the show's crew and loyal fans for an "amazing seven years", adding: "It's been wild, truly wild". "I remember when we first started... so many people didn't believed in us," he said. "[Appointing me as host] was a crazy bet to make. I still think it was a crazy choice, this random African. "I just [find] myself filled with gratitude for the journey. It's been absolutely amazing. It's something that I never expected."The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterHe said that after everything that has happened during his time hosting the show - including Donald Trump's presidency and the Covid pandemic - he had decided his "time is up, but in the most beautiful way". "I've loved hosting this show, it's been one of my greatest challenges, it's been one of my greatest joys. But after seven years, I feel like it's time," he said. "I realised there's another part of my life that I want to carry on exploring. I miss learning other languages, I miss going to other countries and putting on shows. I miss just being everywhere and doing everything."I'm really grateful to a network who believed in this random comedian nobody knew on this side of the world."I never dreamed that I would be here. I sort of felt like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. I came in for a tour of what the previous show was, and then the next thing I know I was handed the keys."All I can say is thank you very much."</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By James Waterhouse"><Text>Every day, convoys of people arrive in a supermarket car park in Zaporizhzhia city, escorted in by police vehicles. They've made the hazardous trip out of Russian-occupied territory in southern Ukraine, finally reaching the relative safety of this regional capital still firmly under Ukrainian control.And yet this is one of four Ukrainian regions that Russia is formally annexing, after a five-day exercise it called a referendum and Ukraine and the West condemned as a sham.Among those handing their papers to police is Anton Osenev, who says the Russians tried to mobilise him twice to fight against his own country, around his home city of Melitopol. "We weren't home for the first attempt," he says. "On the second occasion they stayed at our house for some time". Had it not been for his pregnant wife being in the room, they would have taken him, he believes. His father is in the Ukrainian army, and if he had been seized he would have been on the opposite side."I still don't understand what's happening, we need some rest."Few here care about Moscow's declaration of annexation.  What they are afraid of is what the occupiers will do now to defend what they've taken - whether that is being forced to fight for Russia, or Moscow resorting to more lethal weapons.Last week Vladimir Putin threatened to use all resources at his disposal, even nuclear weapons.For the Kremlin, that's the very point - to create uncertainty over what comes next.As you drive south towards the front line from Zaporizhzhia city, the roads seem to empty.Fewer people walk along the roadside. A car or military vehicle occasionally speeds by. You don't go for leisurely drives around here.What you do get more of are military checkpoints. Ukrainian forces use them to control who gets through, and work out who is coming from the direction of Russian-occupied territory. After our military escort gets us through, we're met with an open, straight road.Half an hour later we arrive at the village of Komyshuvakha, a small settlement in the Ukrainian outback.A handful of damaged buildings hug a wide, straight highway. Most windows are boarded up. On this autumnal afternoon it's almost silent. If we carried on driving for 11 miles, we'd encounter a Russian checkpoint. An area Moscow now sees as its new "border" with Ukraine. Despite the region's capital staying under Ukrainian control, Russian forces control most of the Zaporizhzhia region. Today's annexation announcement is a continuation of their attempts to make their presence seem just. For those we meet in Komyshuvakha, nothing seems fair.One of them is Liubov Smyrnova. She tearfully takes us to a burnt-out shell which was once her home. It was hit by a missile in May. She's only just felt able to return. "I think that Putin's politics is to destroy us, it's a genocide of our people," she tells me, while sifting through fragments of shrapnel. "We are under constant pressure. I can't even describe it with words. Komyshuvakha is shelled almost every day."Most people are inside because strikes tend to happen in the middle of the day, we're told. For now, the sound of birdsong and the occasional bark of a dog masks what has happened to this small community. It dawns on you that it's mostly women left here. The men of Komyshuvakha are mostly fighting, or just elsewhere.Around the corner, we speak to three women outside the building they've lived in for 70 years. Their eyes moisten as the strain of life here bubbles to the surface. "Winter is coming and there's not a single window in the house," they explain, often talking over each other. "It's like we're sitting on a powder keg." So, what do they make of Russia's claim to half of the region they live in?"There should be a free and independent Ukraine," they say. "We didn't attack anyone, didn't hurt anyone, and didn't want anything. We want to live the way we did before."Behind a fire escape door in an empty kindergarten, there's activity. Through it are three women busily washing potatoes and cooking pancakes. They don't know who they're cooking for, they say, just that the Ukrainian military instructs them to. As she stirs batter in a large bowl, I ask Anzhela whether she cares that Russia now sees her village as being close to its new "border"."We don't want that," she says. "We want to live the way we lived. Everything was fine, everything was all right." She whisks with a bit more vigour. "We grew up this way. Our children grew up this way and our grandchildren too." </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Tiffanie Turnbull"><Text>Australia has said it will end mandatory Covid isolation requirements from next month.Currently anyone who tests positive to the virus must isolate for five days, but that will end from 14 October.At times nicknamed "Fortress Australia", the country has had some of the strictest restrictions in the world since the pandemic began. Australia's chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, said the "emergency phase" of its response was probably over. But Prof Kelly said the decision "does not in any way suggest that the pandemic is finished".Mandatory isolation had been one of the few restrictions remaining. Australia continues to record about 5,500 virus cases each day, official figures show. It is one of the world's most vaccinated countries.Prof Kelly said the country would see "future peaks" of the virus, but it currently had "very low" numbers of hospital admissions and aged-care outbreaks.The Australian Medical Association opposes the change, saying those who pushed for it are not "scientifically literate" and are putting lives at risk.About 15,000 people have died with the virus in Australia - fewer than many nations. The vast majority have happened this year after the country opened up. Australia had closed international borders for around two years and imposed strict limits on movement around the country.Australia revisited - a country changed by CovidIs Australia still a Covid success story? Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said most existing governments payments for people who have to miss work because of Covid would also be scrapped."It was always envisaged that these measures were emergency measures," he said.Casual workers and those in high-risk areas like aged care or health will still be able to get financial support.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Frances Mao"><Text>Women working at Australia's research camps in Antarctica have endured widespread sexual harassment, a report has found.It described evidence of uninvited touching, requests for sex, and a predatory culture which condoned pornography on walls and sexual taunts.Woman also felt they had to hide their menstruation, and ration tampons and pads because they were so limited.Officials have condemned the findings and vowed to bring on cultural change.Australia's Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek said she was "gobsmacked" by the independent review of Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) sites. It was instigated after individuals made complaints."As a minister, I take a zero-tolerance response to sexual harassment in any workplace I am responsible for," Ms Plibersek told the Australian Broadcasting Corp (ABC).Australia's Antarctic sites are located on the continent's eastern edge, and include the Casey, Davis and Mawson research stations. During the summer up to 500 expeditioners can be dispatched there, but during winter months the camps are reduced to about 15-30 key workers. Those workers - including doctors, chefs, and field officers - typically spend a year living at a station.Women in the camps felt like they couldn't escape or get immediate help due to the remote and isolated environment, said the report's author Meredith Nash, a professor at the Australian National University.They "have to work in the fields with their abusers for weeks at a time because they simply can't leave", she told the ABC, which first reported the findings on Friday."Or, because of the power dynamics, they are not in a position to make a complaint or get support immediately as they would do back home," she added.Sex harassment rife in Australia parliament - reportThe long-lasting effects of workplace sexual harassmentThe report also found a homophobic culture among the male-dominated field, and said people feared speaking out because they didn't want to be excluded from future expeditions.In such a masculine environment, women scientists felt pressure to hide their periods out of fear of male judgement, the review said.Women also had to "go through a gatekeeper to access free menstrual products" with a voucher request system, reflecting a lack of adequate support in basic camp infrastructure. AAD Director Kim Ellis said they were already putting in place the report's recommendations."I am deeply concerned by the experiences described at our workplaces where people have been sexually harassed, discriminated against and excluded," he said.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Malu Cursino"><Text>Morocco's culture ministry has accused Adidas of appropriating Moroccan culture in its new jerseys for Algeria's football team.Adidas said the design was inspired by the Mechouar Palace in Algeria.However the geometric blue, teal and yellow design is a pattern called zellige, which is common in Moroccan mosaics, the ministry's lawyer said.The neighbouring nations have a long history of tensions, as they continue to dispute Western Sahara. Lawyer Mourad Elajouti wrote on Facebook that he had issued a legal warning to Adidas, on behalf of Morocco's Ministry of Culture.In a letter to the company's chief executive Kasper Rorsted, Mr Elajouti said the new design was cultural appropriation and "an attempt to steal a form of Moroccan cultural heritage and use it outside its context".He has demanded the German sportswear brand remove the design within two weeks.Mr Elajouti added that Algeria's 2022-2023 season kit "contributes to the loss and distortion of the identity and history of these [zellige] cultural elements".The BBC has contacted Adidas for comment.Algeria and Morocco share a nearly 2,000 km (1,242 miles) border, which has been a source of tension since independence from French colonial rule.In 1963, they had the Sand War over Morocco's claim to territory in Algeria. Drugs, dates and disputes at mules' border crossingLater on, Algeria backed the Polisario Front's campaign for Western Sahara's independence from Morocco, leading to the 1975-1991 Western Sahara War.The border was then closed in 1994 for security reasons after militant Islamists bombed a hotel in the historic Moroccan city of Marrakesh.More recently, in 2021 Algeria cut diplomatic ties with its neighbour, accusing Morocco of "hostile acts". Morocco called the move "completely unjustified".</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Jonathan Josephs"><Text>The US has said it "seems" Russia is to blame for this week's leaks in the Nord Stream gas pipelines.US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm told the BBC an investigation was being carried out into the cause of what she called "an act of sabotage", adding "it is highly unlikely that these incidents are coincidence"No evidence about how the leaks happened has been made public.Russia has dismissed suggestions that it was to blame.It said claims it had damaged the pipelines were "stupid and absurd".Sweden finds new leak in Russian gas pipeline    EU ramps up pipeline security after mystery attacksHow can the world cope without Russian oil and gas?President Putin described the damage as "unprecedented sabotage, in fact, an act of international terrorism" during a phone call with Turkey's President Erdogan, according to the Kremlin, which added Russia plans to bring it up for "urgent discussion" at the UN Security Council.Earlier Russia's Foreign Ministry suggest it was the US that stood to benefit from the pipeline being out of action because it would be able to increase its own natural gas sales.The White House has dismissed such suggestions."It's probably most likely some form of sabotage," according to Mike Fulwood of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies."If there was one incident of a pipeline rupture of leak then accidental damage could be a possibility, it is very rare."The most likely cause of accidental damage is an anchor being dropped and dragging across the pipeline".He added that with multiple leaks in a short period of time "doesn't sound like it could be accidental, although theoretically it could be".The high water pressure at the bottom of sea makes a detonation difficult, according to energy engineering expert Professor Russell Johns of Penn State University. He says "it is not likely that the Russians detonated their own pipeline. They could have simply cut-off gas to the pipeline entrance" if they wanted to stop supplies.The money Russia continues to receive for its fossil fuels is helping fund its invasion of Ukraine. The gas escaping from the pipeline near the Danish island of Bornholm has been in the pipe since the beginning of September when Moscow closed it off, saying repairs were needed to a vital artery in supplying Europe's energy needs. Ms Granholm suggested the energy relationship between Russia and Europe was being consigned to history."I think Russia has proven itself to be an unreliable energy partner," she said."No country wants to take the risk of putting a significant amount of its energy demand to Russia's supply. I think this accelerates the EU's push to become energy independent through clean energy".The war in Ukraine has had a profound impact in pushing up global energy prices. They've been the biggest contributor to soaring inflation in the UK, Eurozone and US, something which is threatening to reduce global economic growth.The increasing cost of living has made political leaders around the world re-evaluate where they get their energy from, according to Ms Granholm, who was speaking from the International Atomic Energy Agency's Ministerial Conference in Vienna."Every country is looking at the risks associated with putting too many eggs in one basket or putting too many eggs in the basket of petro-dictators and the volatility of the fossil fuels that accrue from that. Everyone is looking to how they can become energy independent."Wind, solar and nuclear energy are among the alternatives many countries are trying to increase as they also aim to meet the Paris climate change targets.However an analysis by Columbia University suggests that Russia has a 46% share of global enrichment capacity for nuclear fuel, and the International Energy Agency warned in July that China has an 80% share "in all the key manufacturing stages of solar panels".When asked how the US and others don't end up overly reliant on such alternatives Ms Granholm replied that "this move to clean energy could be part of a great peace plan" and that such a move "helps people's pocketbooks, helps the economy, and helps energy security".This year's steep increases in the price of oil and gas have benefitted the energy giants who get them to consumers. In the first half of this year the combined profit of five of the biggest western energy firms, BP, Shell, Total, Chevron and Exxon almost tripled to just over $95.2bn with much of it going to shareholders.Ms Granholm said President Biden's administration wanted to see such companies lower prices at petrol pumps "so that citizens are not hurting".Despite acknowledging that oil is traded on a free market she called on them to help, "at least the American companies as good American citizens" and warned they could face a windfall tax similar to what has been seen in the UK."We don't want that huge amount of profit to end up triggering consequences, either Congressionally or elsewhere, that will not be in their interest."We want them to be responsible and not be buying back shares instead of increasing production, production that would ultimately reduce prices because of increasing supply. We are looking at legislative tools as well as otherwise pressuring them."One other way the US could help increase the supply of oil to global markets is by lifting some of the sanctions imposed on Venezuela by President Trump.The South American country has the world's largest oil reserves but has been exporting minimal amounts of oil because of the restrictions. They were enacted because of alleged corruption and the political fallout from 2019's contested election. An increase in supplies would be likely to push down global oil prices. When asked if it was time to lift the sanctions, Ms Granholm didn't dismiss the idea, replying: "I'm not going to get ahead of the White House on that."You can watch Jennifer Granholm's interview in full on Talking Business with Aaron Heslehurst this weekend.Viewers in the UK can watch the show at 15:30 on the BBC News Channel, and afterwards on BBC iPlayer.In other countries, it will be on BBC World News on Saturday at 23:30 GMT, Sunday at 05:30 and 16:30 GMT and Monday at 16:30 GMT.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="BBC News, author unspecified"><Text>A US army major doctor and her wife, a civilian doctor, have been charged with a plot to leak information to the Russian government. Jamie Lee Henry and Anna Gabrielian are accused of planning to share confidential information about patients at a military hospital. The pair allegedly told an undercover FBI agent that they were motivated by patriotism for Russia. Representatives of the couple have not yet commented on the case.There has been no comment from Russian authorities, either. The pair were charged with conspiracy and the disclosure of identifiable health information, in an indictment filed in a court in Baltimore, Maryland which was unsealed on Thursday after their arrest. Prosecutors said the couple wanted to help the Russian government "gain insights into the medical conditions of individuals associated with the US government and military".The indictment states that Maj Henry, 39, planned to use her security clearance to gain access to private medical records from the hospital at Fort Bragg, the large military base where she worked. Dr Gabrielian, 36, is accused of planning to share information from where she worked, believed to be Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. She allegedly offered help to the Russian embassy in Washington several months ago, after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In mid-August she was approached by a person claiming to work for the Russian embassy, who was in reality an FBI agent. During the meeting, the indictment says she told the agent that "she was motivated by patriotism toward Russia to provide any assistance she could to Russia, even if it meant being fired or going to jail".She is accused of offering to bring her wife into the plot, and telling the agent that she had access to medical information at the base and insight on how the US was training the military to provide assistance to Ukraine. At another meeting later on the same day, Maj Henry allegedly told the agent that she was also committed to Russia, and considered volunteering to join the Russian army. She apparently said she had reservations about violating the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which is what the couple have been charged with. But Dr Gabrielian allegedly had no such concerns, and handed over some information later in August. The indictment suggests the couple planned to hand over the medical records in order to prove their willingness to help the Russians, and their level of access to secret information. Dr Gabrielian is also accused of telling the agent that her wife could share information about how the US military establishes army hospitals in war conditions, and previous training given by the US to the Ukrainian military. If convicted, the defendants face a maximum of five years in prison for the conspiracy, and 10 years for each count of disclosing health information. Maj Henry was the first known active-duty US Army officer to come out as transgender, after the army granted her permission to officially change her name and gender in 2015, the same year the couple were married.

The incubation period can last from two days to three weeks. Ebola can be associated with other illnesses such as malaria and typhoid.The fact that it was three weeks before the first case was detected on 20 September has caused concern.Ebola spreads between humans by direct contact with bodily fluids and contaminated environments. Funerals can be a particular risk if mourners have direct contact with the body.Most of the 31 cases identified are in Uganda's central district of Mubende, of whom six people have died.However, the death toll may be higher. The health ministry says there were 18 deaths, linked to confirmed cases, where burials took place before they could be tested.The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates the fatality rate is between 41% and 100%.Another concern is that this is the Sudan strain of Ebola, for which there is no approved vaccine, unlike the more common Zaire strain. This means there has been no vaccination of health workers, who account for six of the confirmed cases.The Zaire strain was responsible for the largest ever outbreak of Ebola, in West Africa from December 2013 to 2016. More than 11,000 people died.With more than 28,000 cases in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, scientists carried out intensive research into Ebola vaccines.Two years after that epidemic ended, the then unlicensed Ervebo vaccine, developed by Merck, was used during an outbreak of the Zaire strain in the west of the Democratic Republic of Congo. It was granted clearance by the WHO, which said it had limited infections and saved lives.A second vaccine by Johnson &amp; Johnson has since been approved for use by the European Medicines Agency. But neither of these vaccines has been tested against the Sudan strain.Nonetheless Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni said his government was exploring whether it was worth trying them.The focus is on contact tracing - finding those who have been in close proximity with patients, especially those who attended the community funerals.A 51-bed treatment facility is operational in Mubende district, the epicentre of the outbreak. A second facility is due to be set up soon.President Museveni said two mobile laboratories would be sent to Mubende by Friday, so that people would not have to travel for tests and risk spreading the virus.Medics have expressed concern about the lack of adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves and masks. They have also called for the affected region to be put under quarantine. However, President Museveni ruled out restrictions, saying: "Ebola is not spread like corona[virus]" as it is not an airborne disease.He said markets, schools and places of worship would remain open, but urged people to observe personal hygiene and avoid close contact. Ebola jumps to humans from infected animals, such as chimpanzees, fruit bats and forest antelope. Bushmeat - wild forest animals hunted for human consumption - is thought to be the natural reservoir of the virus.It then spreads between humans by direct contact with contaminated bodily fluids - blood, saliva, vomit, semen, vaginal discharge, urine, faeces and sweat.Men who have recovered from Ebola have also been found to harbour the virus in their semen for a period after recovery. To prevent infection, health professionals advise avoiding contact with cases, including stopping shaking hands, washing hands with soap and water and cleaning surfaces with chlorinated water.It is also important to isolate cases and their contacts. Countries usually set up holding centres for suspected cases and treatment centres for laboratory-confirmed cases.In eastern DR Congo, which borders Uganda, survivors of Ebola played a key role in providing care for infected patients as it has been established that they cannot be re-infected. However, medical teams must wear full PPE when attending to cases to prevent infection. Bodies, in a body bag, must be buried by those wearing proper PPE. More recent innovations have included having body bags with clear covers around the face to enable families to view the body safely before burial. </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Jessica Murphy"><Text> In recent years Canada has worked to advance reconciliation with indigenous people in the country. What does the accession of a new King of Canada mean for that process? Earlier this year, at a reception in Canada's national capital, King Charles - at the time the Prince of Wales - was asked for an apology. The request came from Assembly of First Nations National Chief RoseAnne Archibald, who told him that the Crown needs to make amends for the "assimilation and genocide" of indigenous schoolchildren at residential schools run by the Anglican Church - of which Charles is now the head - and for its role in colonisation. The three-day visit was Charles's nineteenth official tour in the country, and his last as the Prince of Wales.Charles did not apologise on the trip, though he spoke of the need to "come to terms with the darker and more difficult aspects" of history.But some are hopeful that the new King's accession will be the beginning of a more positive relationship between the Crown and indigenous peoples in Canada.Around the world, Commonwealth nations, including Canada, are grappling with what the role of the monarchy following Queen Elizabeth's death, and what her son, Charles, should do to make amends for colonialism.  In Canada, the King's accession comes amid a national conversation about reconciliation with indigenous peoples. It is a conversation that has been building for years, but came to the forefront last summer as First Nations came forward with evidence of the discovery of unmarked graves on the sites of former residential schools - government-funded institutions established in the 1800s that were part of a former policy to assimilate indigenous children.For Canada, reconciliation is multi-faceted. In addition to a royal apology, many have called on the Crown to return indigenous artefacts that were removed and taken to Britain, and to play a more active role in honouring historic treaty relationships between the monarchy and indigenous people.These treaties are constitutionally recognised agreements that define the rights and responsibilities between indigenous groups and federal and provincial governments. Treaties with the Crown date back to the 1700s, and negotiating modern treaties is seen as an important part of reconciliation. Cree writer and former treaty negotiator Darrel J McLeod argued in Canada's Globe and Mail newspaper earlier this month that Queen Elizabeth failed to use the resources available to her to make amends for things done in the Crown's name - from issuing formal apology to the repatriation of indigenous artefacts.He said he hoped the King will "have the insight and determination to accomplish what his mother wasn't able to and use whatever time that might remain for the Windsor dynasty's role in Canada to turn things around". The child graves behind Canada's national reckoningWATCH: Canada 'Sixties Scoop' - Indigenous survivors map out their storiesCanada was a monarchy even before it was a country. Over 500 years ago, both French and British monarchs presided over colonies in Canada. The connection between the Crown and indigenous peoples dates back even further, to when Europeans first set foot on the continent.To this day, symbols of treaties signed in the 1800s with the Crown can be seen on the prairies. When they were signed, 'treaty medals', which acknowledged promises made by the Crown, were handed out. "It had the Queen's image on one side, and that was given to every chief who signed the treaty," noted Doug Cuthand, a Canadian columnist and member of the Little Pine First Nation in the province of Saskatchewan. "And every chief who signs a treaty was given a Union Jack, because Canada didn't have a flag at that time."Although now it is the federal government, and not the Royal Family, that has the power to administer these agreements, the Crown still has a symbolic relationship with indigenous people. Union Jacks are still a common sight at First Nations gatherings across those provinces, signifying the importance of those agreements, said Mr Cuthand. Canada's Governor General Mary Simon is the representative of the Crown in Canada, one of 15 countries where the King continues to operate as head of state. An Inuk woman - and the first indigenous person in the role - she recalled how as a child in the far north, portraits of the Queen hung in many homes."She was revered by communities, Inuit people in the Arctic," she told the BBC's Chief International Correspondent Lyse Doucet earlier this month.But there is anger directed at the monarchy as well. In Manitoba last year, statues of Queen Victoria and Queen Elizabeth were toppled during protests over the unmarked graves at residential school sites. There is a recognition by indigenous people of the damage that colonialism did to the First Nations, said Mr Cuthand, but also of the ties forged long ago."It's a bit of a dichotomy, isn't it?" he said. "There's that sort of high-level relationship that exists, but then there was the implementation of the treaties and of the colonialism that followed."Nathan Tidridge, vice-president of the Institute for the Study of the Crown in Canada, argues that when Canada became a country in 1867, it in many ways eclipsed that original relationship between monarchy and indigenous nations, placing political power and the treaties under the control of federal governments. Entrusted by the Crown to govern, they oversaw damaging policies like residential schooling.Still, many indigenous people in Canada say King Charles has an important role in reconciliation despite being limited to a symbolic role as head of state and expected to not meddle in Canadian political affairs.  "All signs point to an engaged King who is more competent on indigenous issues" than Queen Elizabeth was, said Niigaan Sinclair, professor of indigenous studies at the University of Manitoba. "We need a monarch that's going to intervene when they see injustice taking place," he said - one that's "going to care beyond just nice words.""We need a monarch that's going to have the ear of the prime minister and say 'these are the treaties that you must adhere to because the Crown has signed onto them.'"King Charles recently reiterated to the governor general that he was committed to reconciliation, and Mr Tidridge sees the potential for work to be done through the Crown's representatives like Ms Simon and her counterparts in Canada's provinces. Although he did not apologise on his recent visit, Mr Tidridge thinks that one day the King could come to Canada for the apology requested by Chief Archibald."You don't just come for a whistle-stop tour, and then issue an apology - this takes time," he said."The Crown is this old institution that sweeps up over a millennia of history. He is someone that recognises and understands that history," Mr Tidridge said of the new King."He could do things that I think that his mother couldn't do."</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Juliana Gragnani &amp; Jake Horton"><Text>Before a vote has been cast in Brazil's forthcoming election, current President Jair Bolsonaro is sowing doubts about how secure the country's voting system is. While campaigning, he has said that the voting machines used across Brazil are open to fraud, with echoes of Donald Trump's rhetoric around the 2020 US presidential election."The system is completely vulnerable," claims President Bolsonaro, without providing evidence. Voting is done electronically, as has been the case since 1996.Each candidate has a number, and on election day voters type the number of their chosen candidate into a voting machine at polling stations across the country. The votes are then counted by the machines, and the totals are sent electronically to a central office. Votes from across the country are tallied up and a final result is announced, usually within hours of polls closing. Each machine also prints out a paper copy of the totals for each candidate. When polls close they are displayed publicly at polling sites, and each machine's votes can be compared with the total recorded by the electoral court. This year, for the first time, these paper copies will be published online on the day of the vote.President Bolsonaro has said: "We cannot have dubious elections in 2022. Public counting of votes is needed." He's been making similar claims for years. After winning the 2018 presidential election in a run-off, he claimed voting fraud robbed him of an outright victory in the first round, which he won by a 17 point margin with 46% of the vote.Subsequent studies of the 2018 election didn't find any evidence of voting irregularities. Brazilians vote electronically, so there are no paper copies of individual ballots.This has been highlighted by President Bolsonaro as a security issue, and he has called for "printable and auditable" paper ballots to safeguard the electronic system."It's impossible to audit elections in Brazil," President Bolsonaro declared in July during a meeting with ambassadors.He says it is "easy to rig" electronic voting machines by altering their source code, the internal commands within a machine's software.It's not true to say you can't audit the vote in Brazil. The machines can retrieve votes cast for an electronic recount.Such an audit took place in the 2014 presidential election, which concluded that there was no foul play."There is no reasonable proof of fraud going on in the past, at least in big audits that have been done," says Prof Marcos Simplicio, who took part in the auditing of the 2014 election.The Supreme Electoral Court, the body that oversees Brazil's election, says the system has a series of procedures in place to secure the vote.For example, a number of voting machines are selected at random to be removed from polling sites for a test vote alongside the actual vote on election day.These are checked to be working correctly by entering test votes for each of the candidates in a process witnessed by party representatives. "The vote placed in the electronic ballot box is secured by several mechanisms. The software goes through several tests, including tests with experts and outside investigators who try to break its security," says Julio Valente, the Information Technology Secretary of Brazil's electoral court.Before each election the court invites researchers and software experts to look for vulnerabilities in the voting system. This year, more than 20 experts tried to penetrate the system but failed to do so.However, over the years experts have said improvements could be made."The security of the Brazilian election system relies heavily on the system's software, which has been the main point of criticism from the academic community since the 90s," says Prof Paulo Matias, a computer security specialist at the University of São Carlos. Brazil election: 'We'll vote for Bolsonaro because he is God'Lula: Can Brazil's 'most popular president' win again?Brazil election: Why it matters so much to the USPresident Bolsonaro has also claimed votes are counted in a "secret room" out of public view at the central electoral office. The votes are counted by computers that are located in a secure room but party representatives can monitor the process."The view of most of the technical community is that fraud is really hard in the current system. The system can be improved and should be, but that doesn't mean there's been fraud," says Prof Simplicio.Allegations that the system is unreliable have spread across social media - often in groups backing the president. Just a quarter of Bolsonaro supporters say they trust the electoral system "a lot", and almost a third don't trust it "at all" according to a recent survey.Videos containing misleading information from previous elections are used to cast doubt on the system.  Two videos that were spread following the 2018 election showed voters entering Bolsonaro's number and receiving the message "null vote". However, on the election day, Brazilians don't vote only for the president. They also cast votes for other political representatives, such as senators and governors, and use unique numbers to do so. A closer look at the two videos shows that Bolsonaro's number had been pressed when the voter was asked to choose a  governor. When there is no candidate with that number, a "null vote" message is displayed. Voters can still correct the mistake and press the right number before confirming their vote.Another video allegedly showed a man pressing Bolsonaro's number and the machine showing his rival's picture instead. At the time, the electoral court debunked the video, saying it had been edited. The video didn't show the voting machine buttons and screen at the same time, which meant different images could've been stitched together.Additional reporting by Mariana SanchesRead more from Reality CheckSend us your questions</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Laura Bicker"><Text>Santiago Matela was 22 when he was dragged off the street by soldiers while playing basketball. The year was 1977, five years since President Ferdinand E Marcos had declared martial law in the Philippines -  on 21 September 1972.Mr Marcos suspended parliament and arrested opposition leaders - Mr Matela was among the tens of thousands of people detained and tortured during a decade of martial law.  Fifty years on, he is no longer afraid to speak out. But he is afraid of not being believed at a time when the truth about one of the darkest periods in Filipino history is under attack. Mr Matela endured three months of torture, including being tied naked to a block of ice. His captors demanded he admit to being a communist. He says he didn't even know what that word meant."They kept on forcing me to confess that I was leading a rally and throwing grenades. They asked me the same questions again and again and beat me. They used a yantok - a cane - and they hit my body many times," he said. "Even my genitals were assaulted by the military just to make you confess what you should not be confessing."Some 70,000 people were imprisoned, 34,000 were tortured and over 3,200 people were killed in the nine years after Mr Marcos imposed martial law, according to Amnesty International.Meanwhile, the Marcos family lived famously opulent lifestyles. Mr Marcos' wife, Imelda Marcos, amassed a huge collection of art and other luxuries, including hundreds of pairs of shoes.They deny siphoning off billions of dollars of state wealth while at the helm of what historians consider one of Asia's most notorious kleptocracies. Public anger at abuse and corruption eventually led to pro-democracy protests in 1986 and the family were forced to flee to Hawaii where they lived in exile. Ferdinand Marcos died three years later.But earlier this year, his son and namesake, Ferdinand Marcos Jr - popularly known as "Bongbong" - led an extraordinary comeback and won the presidency in a landslide victory.What a Marcos revival means for the PhilippinesWhy the Marcos family is so infamous'Politicians hire me to spread fake stories'The Marcos rebranding is the result of a major social media operation, aimed at younger Filipinos born after martial law ended. The message seeded in snappy Facebook, YouTube and TikTok posts is that the family has been unfairly treated by the mainstream press.Mr Marcos Jr has shunned network news interviews and refused to participate in presidential debates. He has made it clear he doesn't want to discuss the past and has instead focused on a promise to unite the nation and help it recover from the crippling effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.This popular message, by a recognisable celebrity name, hit home with voters eager for change - including Mr Matela's children. Mr Matela tells me that his son believes the past should stay in the past, a view that he finds upsetting. "My son is adamantly on their side. He doesn't know that what I'm doing is all for them. These are my experiences and what I'm fighting for is for their sake too, so that they will know what happened. "You want me to just disregard what I went through? That cannot happen. The sufferings I went through are embedded in my mind," he said. "I'm still fighting because of my pain."The Marcos administration insists it has not engaged in disinformation. Gemma, a fact checker from the news website Rappler founded by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Maria Ressa, says the disinformation being propagated is difficult to quantify."It's not one single page, it's not one single account, it's not one single group. The point is that it's coming at you from various points. We've mapped tens of thousands of accounts and groups and pages. "Many look like official history pages and post content that triggers nostalgia but within that content you will find stories peddling an incorrect narrative."Among the most widely spread falsehoods are claims that no arrests were made under martial law."Many of the posts deny human rights abuses took place and claim that the only people incarcerated were rebels or criminals or troublemakers," Gemma said. The Marcos administration has not responded to the BBC's requests for an interview. Mr Marcos Jr has posted an interview on YouTube with his goddaughter where he denies that his father was a dictator.The Marcos family has never apologised, but more than 11,000 victims, including Mr Matela, have received reparations from the government.Their written accounts are logged in dozens of numbered cardboard boxes piled high in an archive at the Human Rights Violations Victims' Memorial Commission, an independent government body.In a new green room at the centre, a young team are creating their own snappy social media posts - with facts about martial law."You have to go where the young people are," says executive director Crisanto Carmelo. Fears the past is being rewritten have led to a push to preserve and digitise the detailed accounts of martial law abuse in the hope that they can be placed in a museum. One file recalls how a mother was handed back the body of her brutally tortured and murdered son. The account is too gruesome to detail here.But will Mr Marcos allow such a museum - one built to honour the victims of martial law - while he is president?"I am optimistic that he will be magnanimous in victory and serious in his intention to unify the country," Mr Carmelo said. "This is the year which marks the 50th year of the declaration of martial law which transformed our country and transformed the lives of many ordinary Filipinos. Many of them are now in their senior years, like me, so a museum is not for me, I lived through it. "A museum is for the younger generation - to say that this happened to our country and if we can come together, they can determine what type of country and system of government and rules of liberty and democracy they want for the future."Many young Filipinos are engaged. On a recent popular historical tour, young Filipinos played games to recreate the past.The idea is to help them pin down the facts and navigate away from a maze of martial law myths.The teams took selfies together - most of them had met only a few hours earlier. They planted flowers at the memorial with the names of those who died under martial law.Seventeen-year-old Hannah found the day emotional."They've lost their dreams, their lives and I wanted to recognise that. I want to go and tell my friends that in order for us to have the liberty and democracy we have today, these were people who sacrificed everything. They suffered a lot of violence and immoral wrongdoings, and they deserve to be recognised."It seems that voices from the past, however painful, are helping to keep this country's collective memory alive.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Mark Savage"><Text>When Coolio first heard the demo that became Gangsta's Paradise, he had the same reaction as the rest of us."I was like, 'Damn, I really like this song.'"The Pennsylvania-born, Compton-raised rapper was at his manager's house in 1995 to pick up a cheque, when he noticed producer Doug Rasheed messing around with the song in another room."So I went to Doug said, 'Yo! What's this?'" "He said, 'It's just a song we're working on', "And immediately I said, 'It's mine'. Just like that. "I freestyled the whole first line, then I sat down, I picked up a pen and I started to write." Released in August 1995, and boosted by a memorable video starring Michelle Pfeiffer, the song immediately ruled the airwaves. Those lurching stings, the other-worldly choir, and that soaring hook, combined with Coolio's distinctive, confessional storytelling, made it an instant classic.It was the first "serious" rap song to top the UK and US charts, opening the door for acts like 2Pac and the Notorious B.I.G, who, until that point, had been considered too abrasive for the mainstream. And its appeal has never lessened. The biggest-selling single of 1995 in America, Gangsta's Paradise has now been streamed more than one billion times on both Spotify and YouTube. "I thought it was going to be a hood record," he told The Voice in 2017. "I never thought it would crossover the way that it did - to all ages, races, genres, countries and generations."And yet... Gangsta's Paradise faced several hurdles on its way to the top. Here's how it unfolded...Pfeiffer and Snoop lead tributes to rapper Coolio 'People thought Coolio in Castlederg was a hoax'Coolio was born Artis Leon Ivey, Jr in Pennsylvania, and moved to Compton in South Central LA as a boy. Suffering from chronic asthma, he became a bookworm and excelled at school."I lived in that library, man," he told Rolling Stone, while visiting his old neighbourhood in 1995. "I read every kid's book they had in there. I even read Judy Blume."That changed when he turned 11 and his parents divorced. Seeking a way to fit in, he fell into the gangster lifestyle and adopted a menacing, street-tough persona. A few years later, he was busted for bringing a weapon into school. Before he turned 20, he had served time behind bars for larceny.Later, Coolio studied at Compton Community College and discovered rap. He took his stage name, Coolio Iglesias, from Latin heartthrob from Julio Iglesias, and released a few singles on the local scene, but drug abuse derailed his career.In his 20s he moved to San Jose to live with his father, while working as a firefighter; and later credited Christianity for helping him overcome his addiction to crack.Still enamoured with rap, he made a guest appearance on WC and the Maad Circle's 1991 debut album, Ain't a Damn Thang Changed; then joined a collective called the 40 Thevz before signing a solo deal with Tommy Boy records - the influential label that played home to De La Soul, Naughty By Nature and House Of Pain.His first album, It Takes a Thief, arrived in 1994, and was praised for its combination of funky grooves and socially-conscious lyrics. The musician's message was exemplified by the "hilarious" video for Fantastic Voyage, said Source magazine."As the Lakeside groove carries you along, Coolio piles about six milion people into the trunk of his '64 and takes them to a magical land where race, poverty, gangs and sexual orientation don't matter and everybody was cool."Hip-hop's gatekeepers were not interested in such idealism. Ivey's anti-violence, pro-acceptance stance somehow made him "soft". He earned the unwelcome nickname "Un-Coolio".But then came Gangsta's Paradise.One day, Doug Rasheed pulled out his copy of Stevie Wonder's 1976 double-album Songs In The Key Of Life and cut a sample from Pastime Paradise, a bleak and anxious track that was one of the first songs to replace an orchestra with synthesized strings.Rasheed added a crunching beat and a menacing synth bass, then took the track to singer Larry "LV" Sanders, who laid down a vocal for the chorus."I came in singing 'Pastime Paradise,' but then I changed it up to 'Gangsta's Paradise,'" he told Rolling Stone for an oral history of the song in 2015. "I did my parts, all the vocals and the chorus, and I did the choir. That whole choir that you hear was actually me - I did all the parts from soprano down to tenor to the bass."LV wanted a rapper to appear on the track, and offered it to his friend Prodeje, who declined. Then Coolio overheard it.Mesmerised, he started writing lyrics straight away. The opening lyric, which riffs on Psalm 23, came to him instantly: "As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death/I take a look at my life and realise there's not much left.""I freestyled the whole first line, then I sat down, I picked up a pen and I started to write," he told the YouTube series Hot Ones in 2016."It was divine intervention. I was an instrument and the song was the entity. It wrote itself."Coolio was 30 at the time the song was written, but the narrator is 23 and he doesn't know if he'll live to see 24. He was "raised by the street", immersed a life of crime and retribution. If anyone crosses him, they'll end up "lined in chalk". But the story never glorifies the gangster lifestyle. The narrator prays every night, aware that he's trapped. In the final verse, he accuses the system of letting him down."They say I gotta learn, but nobody's here to teach me / If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?"It's a bleak story. One that could only have been told with the perspective Coolio gained from his teenage years. And the rapper bristled when his song was lumped in with the so-called "gangster rap" scene."I'm trying to get rid of that jacket that's been put on my back - that I'm a gangsta rapper," he said in 1995. "That's not my thing."My thing is to be true to myself and try to educate and entertain kids. When I make references [to the gangster lifestyle], I'm trying to get kids' attention using language they want to hear."Then I can take them to a deeper level. I'm just trying to get a better understanding of myself and a better understanding of other people."Gangsta's Paradise was a stark departure from the feel-good funk of Coolio's first album and, at first, his record label weren't sure what to make of it. "I called my A&amp;R at Tommy Boy Records, and I played it for him. He said, 'It sounds pretty good - I think it would make a good album cut.' Those were his exact words!"Incensed, the star's manager decided to shop the song around to movie studios. It nearly ended up on the soundtrack to the Will Smith film Bad Boys, but was eventually placed in the Disney movie Dangerous Minds - the true story of a former Marine who turns around a troubled inner-city high school by teaching them poetry and Bob Dylan lyrics.A lukewarm retread of Dead Poets Society, it was allegedly testing badly with audiences until Coolio's song started getting played on MTV. The video, like the film, starred Michelle Pfeiffer, who went face-to-face with Coolio as a camera spun around them."She was real nice," Coolio told Kiss FM's Rap show at the time. "She brought her son down to the shoot with her and she was cool. We had no problems."He was less enamoured with the movie itself, though."I hate those kinds of movies where, you know, the great white hope comes into the inner-city neighbourhood and saves the little children - 'Ooh la la, hey Santa Claus!' or whatever, all those kinds of things put it in play," he told Yahoo two years ago. "Those kinds of moments happen very few and far between. It's not that many people that care about each other [in real life]."According to Rolling Stone's oral history, the producers of Dangerous Minds, Coolio was paid $100,000 (£92,000) for Gangsta's Paradise. There was only one problem: Stevie Wonder hadn't cleared the sample."When Stevie heard it, he was like, "No, no way. I'm not letting my song be used in some gangster song,'" the star recalled. Luckily, Coolio's then-wife Josefa Salinas, knew Wonder's brother. "I guess he had been trying to tap that for years," he joked in the Rolling Stone article. "She made a call to him, got a meeting with Stevie and talked him into it. His only stipulation was that I had to take the curse words out."That edit undoubtedly changed Coolio's life. A profane version of Gangsta's Paradise would never have been played on pop radio, or entered heavy rotation on MTV. When it hit number one, it opened up new possibilities for hip-hop... although, to some, it marked the end of an era."America suddenly realised it could sell non-party rap to Brit panty-waists, and that's exactly what it's done ever since," wrote music journalist Garry Mulholland in his book This Is Uncool: The 500 Greatest Singles Since Punk And Disco."In many ways, Gangsta's Paradise signalled the end of gangsta, or 'reality' rap as a cult. It lost the allure of the forbidden when you mum started singing along."Coolio was ambivalent about the song too, often lamenting how its success overshadowed his other work."It's a blessing and a curse at the same time," he said. "For people that really like Gangsta's Paradise, that's all they really want to hear."In recent years, however, the musician came to appreciate the song's legacy, and his role in hip-hop history."People would kill to take my place," he said in 2018. "I'm sure after I'm long gone from this planet, and from this dimension, people will come back and study my body of work."Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

It stressed that payment details and account passwords were not compromised.Those whose passport or licence numbers were taken - roughly 2.8 million people - are at a "quite significant" risk of identity theft and fraud, the government has since said.Optus said it was investigating the breach and had notified police, financial institutions, and government regulators. The breach appears to have originated overseas, local media reported. In an emotional apology, Optus chief executive Kelly Bayer Rosmarin called it a "sophisticated attack", saying the company has very strong cybersecurity."Obviously, I am angry that there are people out there that want to do this to our customers, and I'm disappointed that we couldn't have prevented it," she said on Friday. Early on Saturday, an internet user published data samples on an online forum and demanded a ransom of $1m (A$1.5m; £938,000) in cryptocurrency from Optus.The company had a week to pay or the other stolen data would be sold off in batches, the person said.Investigators are yet to verify the user's claims, but some experts quickly said the sample data - which contained about 100 records - appeared legitimate.Sydney-based tech reporter Jeremy Kirk contacted the purported hacker and said the person gave him a detailed explanation of how they stole the data.The user contradicted Optus's claims the breach was "sophisticated", saying they pulled the data from a freely accessible software interface."No authenticate needed… All open to internet for any one to use," they said in a message, according to Kirk.In another escalation on Tuesday, the person claiming to be the hacker released 10,000 customer records and reiterated the ransom deadline.But just hours later, the user apologised - saying it had been a "mistake" - and deleted the previously posted data sets."Too many eyes. We will not sale [sic] data to anyone," they posted. "Deepest apology to Optus for this. Hope all goes well from this."That sparked speculation about whether Optus had paid the ransom - which the company denies - or whether the user had been spooked by the police investigation.Adding to the problem, others on the forum had copied the now-deleted data sets, and continued to distribute them.It also emerged some customers' Medicare details - government identification numbers that could provide access to medical records - had also been stolen, something Optus did not previously disclose. Late on Wednesday, the company said this had affected almost 37,000 Medicare cards.  Optus has been inundated with messages from angry customers since last week. People have been warned to watch out for signs of identity theft and for opportunistic scammers, who are said to be already cashing in on the confusion. A class-action lawsuit could soon be filed against the company. "This is potentially the most serious privacy breach in Australian history, both in terms of the number of affected people and the nature of the information disclosed," said Ben Zocco from Slater and Gordon Lawyers.The government has called the breach "unprecedented" and blamed Optus, saying it "effectively left the window open" for sensitive data to be stolen.In an ABC television interview on Monday, Cyber Security Minister Clare O'Neil was asked: "You certainly don't seem to be buying the line from Optus that this was a sophisticated attack?""Well, it wasn't. So no," Ms O'Neil replied. The moment drew lots of attention online. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterMs Bayer Rosmarin told News Corp Australia on Tuesday: "We have multiple layers of protection. So it is not the case of having some sort of completely exposed APIs [software interfaces] sitting out there."I think most customers understand that we are not the villains," she said, adding Optus could not say more while the investigation was ongoing.The company has faced calls to cover the costs of replacement passport and driving licences, as people scramble to protect themselves.The breach highlights how much Australia lags behind other parts of the world on privacy and cyber issues, Ms O'Neil says."We are probably a decade behind… where we ought to be," she told the ABC.Australia probes firms over customer 'faceprints' Australia's Nine TV network hit by cyber-attackBoth sides of politics have traded blame on the issue. Opposition MPs have said the Labor government is "asleep at the wheel", but the government points out it was only elected in May after a decade of conservative rule.Ms O'Neil pointed to two areas needing urgent reform.She argues the government should be able to better penalise companies like Optus. In some countries, the company would have faced hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties but Australia's fine is capped at about $2m, she said.She also wants to expand cyber-security laws that were introduced last year to include telecommunications companies."At the time, the telecommunications sector said: "Don't worry about us - we're really good at cybersecurity. We'll do it without being regulated. I would say that this incident really calls that assertion into question."Security experts have also suggested reforming data retention laws so telecommunication companies don't have to keep sensitive information for so long. Ex-customers should also have the right to request companies delete their data, experts say.Optus says it is required to keep identity data for six years under the current rules.Other industry figures have argued consumers should be able to take companies that lose control of their information to court, instead of the industry regulator.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Katy Watson"><Text>In the second of two profiles of the leading candidates in the race to become Brazil's new president, Katy Watson asks if Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is the same person who took the world by storm 20 years ago.It is no coincidence that Lula chose the Amazon as one of his key destinations on the campaign trail. The 76-year-old's main rival in the presidential election on 2 October, far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, has been accused of destroying the rainforest. Lula knows that climate issues have soared to the top of the political agenda and in Manaus, the biggest city in the Amazon, he told reporters "the planet needs special attention from all of us"."We need to look after our forest, our fauna, our water, but most of all, we need to look after our people because they're struggling, they're in need and they need to live with dignity," he said. "We can reclaim this country, it's possible to once again walk with our heads held high."Lula chose the Museum of the Amazon to meet indigenous leaders and talk about the future of the forest. "Nobody wants to turn the Amazon into an untouchable world sanctuary," he told the audience. "What we want is to benefit from our wealth, our biodiversity." By saying that, the former president shows that he is aware of his rival's message. President Bolsonaro is at great pains to say that the rest of the world needs to stop meddling in Brazil's affairs.It is 20 years since Lula won the presidency for the first time. A former metal worker and union leader, he became a familiar face during the strikes of the 1970s, when workers called for higher wages, defying Brazil's military rulers.He came to power promising change. Helped by high commodity prices, he spent the windfalls on areas such as higher education and welfare programmes that contributed to lifting millions of Brazilians out of poverty. Described by former US President Barack Obama as "the most popular politician on Earth", Lula left office after eight years in power with an approval rating of more than 80%.Like him or hate him, he was a politician unlike any other. But in recent years, that legacy has been tainted with his party - and Lula himself - hit by corruption scandals. In 2017, he was sentenced to nine years in prison. His convictions were quashed four years later, but his brush with the law means that he is no longer just seen as the "saviour" of Brazil. Instead, many millions of Brazilians see him as a corrupt politician unfit for office.Given that split among voters, I asked him how he thought he could convince the electorate he is the right man to lead Brazil. "Deaths [like that] of Dom Phillips and Bruno Pereira can't ever happen again," he said, skirting the question with a reference to the killing in June of a British journalist and an indigenous expert in the Amazon."Brazil needs to be transformed into a civilised country, it can't fall victim to inhumane people," he added. "I am convinced that we need to change Brazil - and changing Brazil means having a government that assumes responsibility for really caring for people."Not far from the centre of Manaus, where Lula spoke, 24-year-old mother-of-three Carol Araújo lives in small community of palafitas - houses that sit on stilts over a small river.Rainy season is coming to an end and the earth below the houses here in the neighbourhood of São Jorge resembles a swamp more than a river.Rubbish is everywhere: broken bottles, old boxes and shoes. In the sweltering heat of Manaus, the stench is overpowering.  Official figures suggest an estimated 63 million people now live in poverty in Brazil, and Carol, who was born in São Jorge, is one of them. She knows nothing but hardship, but she does know who she is going to cast her ballot for. "I'm going to vote for Lula because under him, everything was easier," she says. "But I don't know if [by him] coming back things will improve." It is a risk she is prepared to take. With food and energy prices rising, she cannot make ends meet."I try and find work when it comes my way but it's hard. I have to make it work to feed my children." She says that it comes down to knowing who will help her and those like her, because "during the elections, all the politicians do is make promises".Lula more easily relies on the older generation, which can remember the good times, but he knows he will have to win over the younger generation voting for the first time. "It's a sign of the incapacity of Brazil's elite to renew itself," says Oliver Stuenkel, professor of international relations at the Getúlio Vargas Foundation in São Paulo. "Lula has been running for president since Brazil became a democracy in the late 1980s, and in that sense he is very much a key personality of Brazil's transition from autocracy to democracy. But he struggles to point to the future, he's very much a throwback."But while this is the same Lula, he will not be in charge of the same Brazil. Economic crises and more political polarisation set the country apart from what he inherited the first time.For supporter Beth Ferreira, that does not matter. "I am crazy about Lula - Brazil needs him because we are in decline," she says. "When he started in 2003, Brazil was in the same situation, it was devastated. And we think he can do the same thing - our hope never dies."</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By David Gritten"><Text>Iran's supreme leader has blamed the US and Israel for the anti-government protests sweeping the country, in his first public comments on the unrest.Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said "riots" had been "engineered" by Iran's arch-enemies and their allies, and alleged that Qurans had been burned.He also called on security forces to be ready to deal with further unrest.The protests - the biggest challenge to his rule for a decade - were sparked by the death in custody of a woman.Mahsa Amini, 22, fell into a coma hours after being detained by morality police on 13 September in Tehran for allegedly breaking the strict law requiring women to cover their hair with a hijab, or headscarf. She died three days later.Her family has alleged that officers beat her head with a baton and banged her head against one of their vehicles. The police have said there is no evidence of any mistreatment and that she suffered "sudden heart failure".Women have led the protests that began after Ms Amini's funeral, waving their headscarves in the air or setting them on fire to chants of "Woman, life, freedom" and "Death to the dictator" - a reference to Ayatollah Khamenei.The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterAddressing a graduation ceremony of police and armed forces cadets on Monday, the supreme leader said Ms Amini's death "broke our hearts"."But what is not normal is that some people, without proof or an investigation, have made the streets dangerous, burned the Quran, removed hijabs from veiled women and set fire to mosques and cars," he added, without mentioning any specific incidents. The ayatollah, who has the final say on all state matters, asserted that foreign powers had planned "rioting" because they could not tolerate Iran "attaining strength in all spheres"."I say clearly that these riots and the insecurity were engineered by America and the occupying, false Zionist regime [Israel], as well as their paid agents, with the help of some traitorous Iranians abroad."He also gave his full backing to the security forces, saying that they had faced "injustice" during the unrest.Iran Human Rights, a Norway-based group, said on Sunday that at least 133 people had been killed by security forces so far. They include 41 protesters whom ethnic Baluch activists said had died in clashes in Zahedan on Friday.State media have reported that more than 40 people have been killed, including security personnel.Ayatollah Khamenei's comments came a day after security forces violently cracked down on a protest by students at Iran's most prestigious science and engineering university, reportedly arresting dozens.The BBC's Kasra Naji says the gunfire heard around the campus of Sharif University of Technology in Tehran on Sunday night spread fear among many Iranians that authorities had decided to make an example of the students.Security forces tried to the enter the campus, but the students drove them back and closed all the entrance gates.But, our correspondent adds, a siege developed and the students who tried to leave through an adjacent car park were picked up one by one and beaten, blindfolded and taken away.In one video posted on social media, a large number of people are seen running inside a car park while being pursued by men on motorbikes. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterThe siege was lifted later in the night following the intervention of professors and a government minister. On Monday, students at the university announced that they would not go back to classes until all of their fellow students had been released from detention. The university meanwhile said it had moved classes online, citing "the need to protect students".Protests were also reported at several other universities around the country. </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Valdya Baraputri and Raja Lumbanrau in Malang, Matt Murphy in London"><Text>Football fans "died in the arms" of players during a crush at Indonesia's Kanjuruhan stadium, the home team coach has said, as the number of children killed in the tragedy rose to 32.Javier Roca said the crush at the match in Java, in which 125 people lost their lives, left him "mentally shattered". Authorities say the youngest victim of Saturday's disaster was just three. Some 18 officers are being investigated after police fired tear gas at fans who invaded the pitch when the match ended.More than 320 other people were injured as supporters were trampled on and suffocated in crushes as they fled the gas. Indonesia's deputy minister of children and women affairs said the children were aged between three and 17. An eyewitness told the BBC that police had fired numerous gas rounds "continuously and fast" after the situation with fans became "tense". Home team Arema FC supporters ran onto the pitch when the match ended in a 3-2 defeat to their rivals Persebaya Surabaya.Videos on social media show fans clambering over fences to escape. Separate videos appeared to show lifeless bodies on the floor.One witness, Chandra, told the BBC that a sea of smoke in the stands caused instant panic among spectators. "Little kids were crying, women were fainting, screams were heard everywhere, all were flocking out," he said. Another fan, Eko, said he couldn't get out of the stand's exits due to the number of people trying to escape. "I went back to the top of the stands with friends. Then I used a scarf to keep the smoke away. After that I jumped into the field and went down through the side door," he said.Ester Andayanengtyas told the BBC her 17-year-old daughter Debora suffered serious injuries, including a broken neck and swelling on the brain during the panic. "I asked her not to watch the game that day. She didn't return home, in the morning her friends were looking for her," Ms Andayanengtyas said. "We looked for her in the ER, but she wasn't there. The hospital told us to look at the mortuary. The confusion happened because my daughter didn't carry an ID." Other witnesses reported hearing parents crying out "where is my child" among the chaos, and one man told the BBC that he saw parents collapsing while protecting their children. "A mother fainted while hugging her child, next to her the boy fainted," he said. "Then some supporters picked up the mother and the boy to get out of the stadium. They were carried away unconscious - maybe because of the tear gas."Muhamad Dipo Maulana, 21, who was at the match, told BBC Indonesian that after the game had ended a few Arema fans went on the pitch to remonstrate with the home team players but were immediately intercepted by police and "beaten".More spectators then took to the pitch in protest, the supporter said."Police with dogs, shields, and soldiers came forward," Mr Dipo told the BBC. He said he had heard more than 20 tear gas shots towards spectators at the stadium.Police spokesperson Dedi Prasetyo told reporters that the officers under investigation "were responsible for holding" the weapons and said they were being questioned by an internal affairs team. A police chief has now been sacked following the investigation.He added that several other officers, including the field security team, and some officials from the Indonesian football league, were also under investigation. Indonesia's human rights commission said it will conduct its own inquiry into the disaster, and President Joko Widodo has ordered that all matches in Indonesia's top league must be stopped until the official probe has been carried out. Amnesty International said the police response amounted to "use of excessive force by the state" to control an unarmed crowd, and protesters in the capital Jakarta on Sunday night carried placards that read "stop police brutality". Indonesia's police force has been previously criticised for its frequent use of tear gas in tightly-packed stadiums.Meanwhile, Mr Roca, the Arema FC coach, told the Spanish broadcaster Cadena Ser that he thought "the police overstepped their mark" in efforts to control the crowd. The announcement of the investigation comes after world football's governing body Fifa called the disaster "a dark day for all involved in football and a tragedy beyond comprehension". Fifa's own regulations say no "crowd control gas" should be carried or used by stewards or police at matches and the body has requested a report on the incident from the Indonesian football federation. Security Minister Mahfud MD wrote on Instagram that the stadium had been filled beyond capacity, with over 42,000 tickets being sold for the game in the 38,000 capacity stadium. "It had gotten anarchic. They started attacking officers, they damaged cars," said Nico Afinta, police chief in East Java, adding that two police officers were among the dead."We would like to convey that... not all of them were anarchic. Only about 3,000 who entered the pitch," he said.Fleeing fans "went out to one point at the exit. Then there was a build-up, in the process of accumulation there was shortness of breath, lack of oxygen", the officer added.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Vanessa Buschschlüter"><Text>Brazil's election is going into a second round in which left-winger Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva will face far-right incumbent Jair Bolsonaro.With almost all the votes counted, Lula had won 48% against Bolsonaro's 43% - a much closer result than opinion polls had suggested.But Lula fell short of the more than 50% of valid votes needed to prevent a run-off. Voters now have four weeks to decide which of the two should lead Brazil.Winning outright in the first round was always going to be a tall order for any candidate - the last time it happened was 24 years ago.But President Bolsonaro and Lula had given their supporters hope that they could achieve just that.Both candidates can and will claim this as a victory, though. Lula has already said that this is a "mere delay" on his way to the presidency.For the 76-year-old former metal worker - who could not run in the 2018 election because he was in prison after being convicted on corruption charges which were later annulled - this spells a remarkable comeback.And President Bolsonaro, whom opinion polls had shown trailing far behind Lula, will rejoice in the fact that he proved the pollsters wrong, just as he had predicted he would. A race that is far from overWhy Brazil's election matters so much to the US'Our candidate isn't perfect, but he beats the alternative'This is a drama which has been years in the making. The two men are arch-rivals and spent much of the campaign trading insults.In the last TV debate before the vote, President Bolsonaro called Lula a thief, in reference to the corruption charges that put him in jail for 580 days before the conviction was annulled. Lula, who has always maintained that the charges against him were politically motivated, has labelled Mr Bolsonaro a madman.Not surprisingly, that tension has filtered down into the streets. During the nights before the vote, neighbours here in Rio could be heard shouting "Lula is a thief" and "Out with Bolsonaro" at each other.  Since the two candidates are such polar opposites, much is at stake.Lula says he will bolster measures to protect the Amazon rainforest, while Mr Bolsonaro has argued that parts of the rainforest should be opened up to economic exploitation.Deforestation and forest fires have soared during President Bolsonaro's time in office. Climate activists have warned that if he is re-elected, the area could reach a tipping point. Critics point out that Lula's environmental record during his time in office - he governed Brazil from 2003 to 2010 - was far from perfect.  But with Mr Bolsonaro counting on the agricultural sector and agribusiness for votes and support, it is Lula who is the preferred choice of climate activists. However, voters in Brazil have many other pressing concerns, such as rising food prices, which have contributed to an increase in poverty and hunger.Mr Bolsonaro acknowledged these concerns in a statement after the results were out. "I understand that a lot of the vote was down to the situation the Brazilian people are in. They are feeling the price rises, especially those of basic goods. I do understand that there's a desire for change but some change can be for the worse," he warned. Many voters also mentioned education and Brazil's high levels of inequality as issues they want the new president to tackle. Much of the campaign, however, was overshadowed by concern that Mr Bolsonaro may not accept defeat after he had said that "only God" could remove him from office. He had also cast doubts on Brazil's electronic voting system, alleging - without providing any evidence - that it was open to fraud. With the result much more favourable to him than predicted, he is now likely to concentrate more on how to sway those voters who cast their ballot for one of the other nine candidates who were eliminated in the first round.All eyes will now be on centrist Senator Simone Tebet, who came third in the election with 4%, and centre-left candidate Ciro Gomes, who came fourth with 3%. Both said that they would announce "in the coming days" who they would throw their weight behind for the run-off. Lula, who seems to thrive on overcoming obstacles, has already announced that "the fight continues until the final victory, that's our motto".</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Ben Tobias"><Text>Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov says his three sons, aged 14, 15 and 16, will soon travel to the Ukraine front line to fight with Russian forces. Kadyrov is a strong ally of Vladimir Putin, although has recently criticised Russian military leadership.On social media, he wrote that a father should teach his sons how to protect their family, people and fatherland. Russia has signed a UN treaty aimed at preventing children under the age of 18 from taking direct part in hostilities.Using children under the age of 15 to participate in hostilities is considered a war crime by the International Criminal Court. However Russia does not recognise its jurisdiction.In a long post on the Telegram messaging app, Kadyrov said his sons' military training began when they were much younger, and the time had come for them to experience a real battle. He also took aim at those "empty-worded" people who claimed the Chechen leader's loved-ones were not taking part in the military operation in Ukraine. The post was accompanied by a slickly-produced video of his sons firing various weapons at a training ground. Kadyrov has ruled the southern Russian republic since 2007, when he was named the region's president by Vladimir Putin. It has been a period of relative stability in Chechnya, which fought unsuccessfully for independence for a decade. But Kadyrov has been criticised for ruling with an iron fist, and allowing human rights violations to flourish. Kadyrov is a fierce supporter of Vladimir Putin, and Chechen forces have been fighting in Ukraine since the start of the war. However, after recent military setbacks in the Kharkiv and Donetsk regions, he criticised Russia's military leadership, describing one commander as a "mediocrity" and bemoaning a lack of basic logistics.He also called for Russia to take more drastic measures against Ukraine, including the use of a tactical nuclear weapon. The Kremlin responded that decisions like that should not be made emotionally.Kadyrov's criticism was in response to the retreat of Russian forces from the Ukrainian town of Lyman in Donetsk region - a major strategic setback for Moscow.Capturing the town is important for Ukrainian forces, because it can be used as a foothold to reach further into Russian-held parts of Ukraine. It was also being used by Russia as a logistics hub.The defeat in Lyman was also symbolic, as it happened just a day after a grand signing ceremony to annex four occupied regions of Ukraine - including Donetsk, where Lyman is situated. Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions all held so-called referendums on joining Russia last month, which were dismissed as a "sham" by Ukraine and its Western allies. On Sunday evening, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukrainian troops had also recaptured some territory in the Kherson region. Its Russian-installed head, Vladimir Saldo, described the situation there as "tense" and admitted Ukrainian forces had made breakthroughs. None of the four regions newly claimed by Russia are completely under Russian control, raising the question of how annexation will work - particularly in Ukrainian-controlled territory. The Kremlin says it will "consult" with residents of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions over where the borders should lie, suggesting that Russia may decide not to lay claim to the entire regions. In Luhansk and Donetsk the situation is different. Just before the war began Mr Putin recognised the whole of those regions as independent republics, which have now - as Moscow sees it - voted to join Russia. </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="BBC News, author unspecified"><Text>Kim Kardashian has agreed to pay a $1.26m (£1.12m) fine for advertising EthereumMax on her Instagram page.The US Securities and Exchange Commission said the reality TV star had received $250,000 for advertising the cryptocurrency, without disclosing she had been paid to do so.She also agreed not to promote crypto asset securities for three years.Her lawyer told BBC News: "Ms Kardashian is pleased to have resolved this matter with the SEC."The lawyer said: "Kardashian fully cooperated with the SEC from the very beginning and she remains willing to do whatever she can to assist the SEC in this matter. "She wanted to get this matter behind her to avoid a protracted dispute. "The agreement she reached with the SEC allows her to do that so that she can move forward with her many different business pursuits."Ms Kardashian, boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr, basketball player Paul Pierce and EthereumMax's creators were sued by investors in January.The legal action alleged they had collaborated to "misleadingly promote and sell" the cryptocurrency in a "pump and dump" scheme designed to inflate the price before selling to investors.EthereumMax disputed the allegations at the time.In spite of its name, EthereumMax has no legal or business connection with the Ethereum cryptocurrency.Anyone can create a crypto coin.All you need is a few pounds, a YouTube tutorial and a funky name.This month alone, dozens of new tokens will be launched, with creators promising their coin will be the next big thing.With little intrinsic value to the product, marketing is key - and as in many modern industries, celebrities can be the make or break. EthereumMax put a huge amount of money into snapping up celebrities such as Kim Kardashian - and at first, it seemed to be working out. But as with many crypto coins, the fall was as dramatic as the rise. Even if EthereumMax had retained the value it gained after the celebrity pump, regulators both in the US and UK were extremely uncomfortable about the marketing of the coin.The crypto industry is still largely unregulated - but Kim Kardashian joins a growing list of people and companies being punished for promoting these highly risky products.Gary Gensler, who chairs the SEC, called the case a "reminder" celebrity endorsement did not necessarily make a product worth investing in."Ms Kardashian's case also serves as a reminder to celebrities and others that the law requires them to disclose to the public when and how much they are paid to promote investing in securities," he said.Later, in a YouTube video about crypto investment, he added: "Celebrity endorsements... don't mean that an investment product is right for you or even, frankly, that it's legitimate."Even if a celebrity endorsement is genuine, each investment has its own risk and opportunities."When it comes to crypto, remember many of these are highly speculative assets. "You may be wondering if it's right for you or even if it might be a scam."</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By James Gallagher"><Text>The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine has gone to Sweden's Svante Paabo for his work on human evolution. The Prize committee said he achieved the seemingly impossible task of cracking the genetic code of one of our extinct relatives - Neanderthals.He also performed the "sensational" feat of discovering the previously unknown relative - Denisovans.His work helped explore our own evolutionary history and how humans spread around the planet. The Swedish geneticist's work gets to the heart of some of the most fundamental questions - where do we come from and what allowed us, Homo sapiens, to succeed while our relatives went extinct.He was just off to pick his daughter up from a sleepover when he got the call saying he'd won. He told the BBC: "I was very surprised and overwhelmed, I had not expected this." The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterIn the 1990s, research on working out the human genetic code was taking place at pace. But that relied on fresh samples of pristine DNA.Prof Paabo's interest was in the old, degraded and contaminated genetic material from our ancestors. Many thought it was an impossible challenge. But he was, for the first time, able to sequence DNA from a 40,000-year-old piece of bone.Those results showed that Neanderthals - who mostly lived in Europe and Western Asia - were distinct from both modern day humans and chimpanzees.His work focused on hominins - the group of modern humans that includes us, Homo sapiens, but also our extinct relatives. "By revealing genetic differences that distinguish all living humans from extinct hominins, his discoveries provide the basis for exploring what makes us uniquely human", the Nobel committee said.BBC Podcast: Svante Paabo on the difference between us and NeanderthalsFurther comparisons between Neanderthal DNA and humans from around the world showed their DNA was a closer match to humans coming from Europe or Asia. This tells us that Homo sapiens had sex and children with Neanderthals after migrating out of Africa around 70,000 years ago. And you can still see the legacy of that today. Between 1-4% of modern human DNA comes from our Neanderthal relatives and this even affects our body's ability to respond to infection.The next seismic contribution to human origins came in 2008. Scientists had found a 40,000-year-old finger bone in the Denisova cave, in Siberia.Prof Paabo was able to sequence a sample of DNA and the results showed it was a previously unknown hominin - known as Denisovans. And it turned out Homo sapiens bred with Denisovans too. In parts of South East Asia up to 6% of people's DNA is Denisovan. Some of this genetic inheritance helps the body cope with low levels of oxygen, aids survival at high altitudes and is found in present-day Tibetans. Prof Paabo only heard the news this morning when he was called by Thomas Perlmann, the secretary for the Nobel Committee for Physiology or Medicine."He was overwhelmed, he was speechless. Very happy," said Prof Perlmann.Prof Paabo is seen as one of the founders of the scientific discipline of paleogenomics. He wins the 10m Swedish kronor (£800,000) prize. He follows in the footsteps of his father, Sune Bergstrom, who won the same Nobel Prize in 1982.His work shows there were already two distinct groups of hominins (Neanderthals and Denisovans) living in Eurasia when Homo sapiens spread from Africa.Analysis suggests these now extinct populations were small and relatively inbred and may not have been able to compete with rapidly expanding modern humans.Follow James on Twitter2021 - David Julius and Ardem Patapoutian for their work on how the body senses touch and temperature. 2020 - Michael Houghton, Harvey Alter and Charles Rice for the discovery of the virus Hepatitis C.2019 - Sir Peter Ratcliffe, William Kaelin and Gregg Semenza for discovering how cells sense and adapt to oxygen levels2018 - James P Allison and Tasuku Honjo for discovering how to fight cancer using the body's immune system2017- Jeffrey Hall, Michael Rosbash and Michael Young for unravelling how bodies keep a circadian rhythm or body clock2016 - Yoshinori Ohsumi for discovering how cells remain healthy by recycling waste2015 - William C Campbell, Satoshi Ōmura and Youyou Tu for anti-parasite drug discoveries</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Jasmine Andersson"><Text>King Charles will host the first state visit of his reign next month when he welcomes the president of South Africa to Buckingham Palace.President Cyril Ramaphosa and his wife, First Lady Tshepo Motsepe, have accepted an invitation to visit the King and Queen Consort.The visit will take place from Tuesday November 22 to Thursday November 24.It is understood the trip was in the early stages of being planned before the Queen's death in September.It will be the first time a South African leader has visited the UK in an official capacity in more than a decade, with the last state visit being in 2010 when Jacob Zuma visited the late Queen.The King has visited South Africa on a number of occasions since his first tour of the country in 1997, which included stops in Pretoria, Johannesburg, Durban and Cape Town.He last travelled to the country in 2011, with the Queen Consort. It was not a state event.The Queen shared a particularly close relationship with Nelson Mandela, the first democratically elected president of South Africa. The pair were said to have enjoyed a warm friendship, and unusually, referred to each other by their first names.Mr Ramaphosa, who has been in power since 2018, is the fourth leader of South Africa since Mr Mandela. State visits are an exercise in soft power and red carpets, filled with royal ceremony and banquets, but focused on the hard-headed business of strengthening international relationships.It's the Foreign Office that advises on which countries are invited - the last being US President Donald Trump in 2019, before Covid stopped any further state visits.It's pomp with a purpose against a backdrop of pageantry, photo ops and the jangle of a royal carriage ride. Even the paintings and items on view from the Royal Collection can be changed to set the right tone.For the first time it will be King Charles who will now be the host at Buckingham Palace, proposing the toast to the South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa.Charles was a guest at the state banquet in 1996 when Nelson Mandela paid a state visit, after post-apartheid South Africa had rejoined the Commonwealth.The new King will want to build his own bridges with the Commonwealth, sending a message about supporting diversity and multiculturalism.When he arrives, Mr Ramaphosa will be given a ceremonial welcome on Horse Guards Parade, and then invited to a state banquet hosted by the monarch. He is expected to spend the rest of their trip visiting Prime Minister Liz Truss, government ministers and leaders of the main political parties. But Mr Ramaphosa's visit is clouded by allegations of money laundering.The rolling scandal, which erupted in June, has seen Mr Ramaphosa accused of covering up of a robbery that took place at his private farm in February 2020.He has repeatedly denied the allegations and insists he will stand for a second term in the 2024 national elections as ANC leader and president.

The company says it only uses sawdust and waste wood.Panorama analysed satellite images, traced logging licences and used drone filming to prove its findings. Reporter Joe Crowley also followed a truck from a Drax mill to verify it was picking up whole logs from an area of precious forest. Ecologist Michelle Connolly told Panorama the company was destroying forests that had taken thousands of years to develop."It's really a shame that British taxpayers are funding this destruction with their money. Logging natural forests and converting them into pellets to be burned for electricity, that is absolutely insane," she said.The row over the UK's largest power plantThe Drax power station in Yorkshire is a converted coal plant, which now produces 12% of the UK's renewable electricity.It has already received £6bn in green energy subsidies. Burning wood is considered green, but it is controversial among environmentalists. Panorama discovered Drax bought logging licences to cut down two areas of environmentally-important forest in British Columbia.One of the Drax forests is a square mile, including large areas that have been identified as rare, old-growth forest.The provincial government of British Columbia says old-growth forests are particularly important and that companies should put off logging them.Drax's own responsible sourcing policy says it "will avoid damage or disturbance" to primary and old-growth forest.  However, the latest satellite pictures show Drax is now cutting down the forest. The company told Panorama many of the trees there had died, and that logging would reduce the risk of wildfires. The entire area covered by the second Drax logging licence has already been cut down.  Burning wood produces more greenhouse gases than burning coal. The electricity is classed as renewable because new trees are planted to replace the old ones and these new trees should recapture the carbon emitted by burning wood pellets. But recapturing the carbon takes decades and the off-setting can only work if the pellets are made with wood from sustainable sources. Primary forests, which have never been logged before and store vast quantities of carbon, are not considered a sustainable source. It is highly unlikely that replanted trees will ever hold as much carbon as the old forest. Drax told the BBC it had not cut down the forests itself and said it transferred the logging licences to other companies. But Panorama checked and the authorities in British Columbia confirmed that Drax still holds the licences.Drax said it did not use the logs from the two sites Panorama identified. It said they were sent to timber mills - to make wood products - and that Drax only used the leftover sawdust for its pellets.The company says it does use some logs - in general - to make wood pellets. It claims it only uses ones that are small, twisted, or rotten.But documents on a Canadian forestry database show that only 11% of the logs delivered to the two Drax plants in the past year were classified as the lowest quality, which cannot be used for wood products. Panorama wanted to see if logs from primary forests cut down by logging companies were being transferred to Drax's Meadowbank pellet plant. The programme filmed a truck on a 120-mile round trip: leaving the plant, collecting piles of whole logs from a forest that had been cut down by a logging company and then returning to the plant for their delivery.Drax later admitted that it did use logs from the forest to make wood pellets. The company said they were species the timber industry did not want, and they would often be burned anyway to reduce wildfire risks. The company also said the sites identified by Panorama were not primary forest because they were near roads. But the UN definitions of primary forest do not mention proximity to roads and one of the sites is six miles from the nearest paved road.Panorama's findings come at a critical moment for Drax.The UK government is due to publish a new biomass strategy later this year, which will set out its policy for natural fuels like wood.A Drax spokesperson said 80% of material in its Canadian pellets is sawmill residuals, which would be disposed of anyway. They also said that Drax applies stringent sustainability standards to its own pellet production as well as suppliers, with verification from third-party certification schemes. "We are constantly reviewing these policies to ensure we take account of the latest science," they added.Panorama's The Green Energy Scandal Exposed is on BBC One at 20:00 on Monday 3rd October and on iPlayer afterwards</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Paul Glynn"><Text>Sacheen Littlefeather, the Native American activist who declined Marlon Brando's Oscar for The Godfather on his behalf in 1973, has died aged 75.The actress, who had breast cancer, died on Sunday, the Academy announced.Her death comes two weeks after the organisation honoured her at a ceremony in Los Angeles, publicly apologising for her treatment at the Oscars.Littlefeather, of Apache and Yaqui heritage, was booed while speaking on stage at the event 50 years ago.Dressed in full Apache attire during the first Oscars to be televised around the world, the Californian, born Maria Cruz, explained on Brando's behalf that he would not accept his best actor gong for the mafia movie in order to protest against the treatment of Native Americans by the film industry and to bring attention to the Wounded Knee protests.To whom does Wounded Knee belong? In 1973, several hundred locals, together with radical activists from the American Indian Movement (AIM), poured into the nearby village of Wounded Knee in South Dakota to protest government abuse.The protest resulted in a violent stand-off with federal agents that went on for 71 days."I went up there, like a proud Indian woman with dignity, with courage, with grace, and with humility," she remembered at the recent event."I knew that I had to speak the truth. Some people may accept it. And some people may not."Screen Actors Guild member Littlefeather struggled to get work in the industry afterwards but said it was "never too late for an apology... it's never too late for forgiveness."In a recent interview with Variety, she said she had made the Oscars speech in order to honour her ancestors and "native people everywhere"."I was met with the stereotypical tomahawk chop, individuals who called at me, and I ignored all of them," she recalled. "I continued to walk straight ahead with a couple of armed guards beside me, and I held my head high and was proud to be the first Indigenous woman in the history of the Academy Awards to make that political statement. "At that time in 1973, there was a media blackout on Wounded Knee and against the American Indian Movement that was occupying it," she went on. "Marlon had called them in advance and asked them to watch the Academy Awards, which they did."As they saw me, up on stage, refusing that Academy Award for the stereotypes within the film industry, and mentioning Wounded Knee in South Dakota, it would break the media boycott."In 2020, Littlefeather told the BBC that straight after the speech she had to leave the stage with two security guards. But, she added, it "was a very good thing" as actor John Wayne was backstage. She said he was "furious with Marlon and furious with me" and wanted to pull her off stage himself.Littlefeather featured in films like The Trial of Billy Jack, Johnny Firecloud and Counselor at Crime, but said she returned to San Francisco after being blacklisted by the industry, to continue her activism and work in health care and the theatre.Paying tribute online on Monday, Dakota/Lakota Sioux writer and biologist Ruth H. Robertson, aka Red Road Woman, pointed to Littlefeather's work with the American Indian Aids Institute of San Francisco.Lakota Man on Twitter offered: "It's with a heavy heart that I mourn the passing of Sacheen Littlefeather. I wish her a blessed journey", later adding: "Honour her".TV writer Joey Clift said: "When I talk about how our current Native storytelling movement in Hollywood is built on the shoulders of activists fighting tirelessly for decades for Native people to finally get our day in the sun, I'm talking about Sacheen Littlefeather. RIP."The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterIn announcing her death online, the Academy quoted Littlefeather, the subject of the 2021 documentary, Sacheen: Breaking the Silence, saying: "When I am gone, always be reminded that whenever you stand for your truth, you will be keeping my voice and the voices of our nations and our people alive."</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Natasha Booty"><Text>Burkina Faso's new military leader, Capt Ibrahim Traoré, has urged cabinet ministers to "move faster" to fix the country's "urgent" problems, including an insurgency by Islamist militants.The man he ousted in a coup on Friday has formally agreed to step down, religious and community leaders said.They said Capt Traoré had accepted Lt Col Paul-Henri Damiba's resignation and conditions he had set.He has gone to Togo, according to that country's government spokesman.In a recording widely shared on social media, Lt Col Damiba said he wished Burkina Faso's new leader every success. It is not known if he was alone when it was made.On Sunday Capt Traoré said the country was facing an emergency in every sector, "from security to defence, to health, to social action, to infrastructure", and it was time for government to "abandon the unnecessary red tape".He wants fast solutions to big problems, which some fear signals a turn towards Russia.Latest updates on Burkina Faso from BBC Africa LiveWhy France faces so much anger in West AfricaCoups that promised and failed to bring safetyRussia and France are engaged in a battle for influence in several former French colonies in West and Central Africa. At the weekend there were attacks on French institutions, after it was reported that Lt Col Damiba was sheltering at a French military base in the capital, Ouagadougou.France's foreign ministry said they were the work of "hostile demonstrators" who had been "manipulated by a disinformation campaign against us".Some in Ouagadougou chanted pro-Russian slogans and waved Russian flags as they greeted the new junta leader and his convoy on Sunday. He regards former colonial power France as an ally of the man he ousted, and has spoken of his willingness to work with new partners to fight Islamist insurgents - and analysts believe that could mean hiring Russian mercenaries.Russian military contractors are said to be active in neighbouring Mali, after French forces pulled out following a row with that country's military leaders. The Russians are accused by rights groups of committing abuses and massacres of civilians, which Russia has always denied.The head of the Russian mercenary Wagner group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has welcomed the takeover in Burkina Faso. Meanwhile, the Russian government said on Monday it "would like the situation in Burkina Faso to normalise as soon possible".Burkina Faso controls as little as 60% of its territory, experts say, and Islamist violence is worsening.The African Union has demanded the return of constitutional order by July 2023 at the latest, agreeing with the regional group Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) that the ousting of leader Lt Col Damiba was "unconstitutional".But Ecowas has since praised "the various parties in Burkina Faso for agreeing to a peaceful settlement of their differences", as days of power struggles came to an end without bloodshed.Lt Col Damiba formally resigned on Sunday in exchange for the new junta agreeing to respect seven conditions  - including a guarantee of his personal and family security, an agreement to continue with efforts at national reconciliation and a continued respect for the guarantee of returning to civilian rule within two years. The deposed colonel had himself ousted President Roch Kaboré in January, saying that he had failed to deal with growing militant Islamist violence.Many citizens in Burkina Faso have not felt safe for some time.The Islamist insurgency broke out in the country in 2015, leaving thousands dead and forcing an estimated two million people from their homes.This is Burkina Faso's ninth coup since independence from France in 1960.Additional reporting by Alys Davies</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Matt Murphy"><Text>Bulgaria's centre-right GERB party has won the country's parliamentary election, preliminary results show.Led by ex-Prime Minister Boyko Borissov, GERB took 25.4% of votes with 99% of ballots counted, officials said. But the 63-year-old faces a difficult task forming a working coalition, as most other parties have already ruled out working with him. Many of his opponents accuse him of overseeing government corruption during his time in office, which he denies.Mr Borissov has previously served three separate terms in Bulgaria's top job, and tackling graft became a key part of an election last November. Sunday's poll was called after the centrist government led by Kiril Petkov lost a no-confidence vote in June amid soaring inflation. The 42-year-old Harvard educated economist ran on an anti-corruption ticket and had urged voters to let him "continue the change" ahead of the vote. But he conceded defeat on Sunday evening after his We Continue to Change party took just 20.4% of the vote. Mr Petkov told reporters that "GERB has the responsibility to form a coalition and govern the country". He has already ruled out working with Mr Borissov, pledging to be an "opposition scrutinising the spending of every lev". Pundits say Bulgaria now faces an uncertain political outlook. "The situation is the same as after the last election but even more complicated," Daniel Smilov from the Centre for Liberal Strategies, told the BTV network. "Coalitions that were possible then are no longer possible now." Mr Borissov says he is willing to work with any party to form a working government, but is likely to have to rely on two pro-Russian parties and the Turkish minority MRF grouping. "What's important for us is for reason to prevail," he said on Sunday. "Believe me, right now I am the most well-meaning and open person to all parties."Whoever leads Bulgaria's next government, the EU's poorest nation faces a host of challenges. Inflation has continued to soar - hitting 15% in August - as energy prices spiral amid a dispute with the Russian state-owned gas giant Gazprom. And ministers will also face a difficult challenge managing the country's relationship with Moscow, after Mr Petkov's government turned its back on Vladimir Putin's regime in April. Bulgaria is an EU and Nato member, and Mr Borissov recently called President Putin the "clear aggressor" in Russia's war with Ukraine. Final results from Sunday's election are expected to come on Thursday after overseas postal votes are counted.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Omega Rakotomalala &amp; Farouk Chothia"><Text>Said to have been a shy but intelligent boy in school, Burkina Faso's Capt Ibrahim Traoré has become the latest military officer to seize power in a coup in one of France's former colonies in West Africa. He overthrew his former comrade, Lt Col Paul-Henri Damiba on 30 September, after accusing him of failing to fulfil his promise of quelling the Islamist insurgency that has gripped Burkina Faso since 2015.Born in 1988, this makes the 34-year-old captain the youngest head of state in Africa, joining the ranks of two other coup leaders - Guinea's charismatic Col Mamady Doumbouya, born in 1981, and Mali's bearded Col Assimi Goïta, born in 1983."I know I'm younger than most of you here. We didn't want what happened but we didn't have a choice," Capt Traoré told government officials.During Lt-Col Damiba's short time in power, attacks by militant Islamists - some of them linked to the Islamic State group and al-Qaeda - increased in Burkina Faso as they seized territory in rural areas and encircled cities, leaving the state in control of only about 60% of the country, according to some estimates. With a lack of strong democratic institutions in a country where the military has long been dominant, Capt Traoré seized power with a pledge to improve security in a nation living in fear of the militants. His coup - the second in Burkina Faso in less than nine months - is the latest sign of the epidemic of coups that UN chief António Guterres raised concern about in 2021."My appeal, obviously, is for - especially the big powers - to come together for the unity of the Security Council in order to make sure that there is effective deterrence in relation to this epidemic of coup d'états," Mr Guterres said at the time. But with global powers focused either on domestic crises - or the war in Ukraine - they have paid little attention to the instability that has wracked countries such as Burkina Faso. If anything, Burkina Faso and some other countries have found themselves increasingly embroiled in the cold war rivalry that has been reignited by the Ukraine conflict, as Russia seeks to expands its influence in the region at the expense of France, which has retained close economic, military and cultural ties to many of its former colonies in Africa. "I know that France cannot interfere directly in our affairs," Capt Traoré said, adding: "The Americans are our partners now, [but] we can also have Russia as a partner."His comments suggest that he could follow the example of his counterpart in Mali, who has allegedly brought in the controversial Russian security group, Wagner, to replace the French in the fight against jihadists, albeit with little success, as the insurgency has worsened there too since the military staged a coup in August 2020. Capt Traoré cut his teeth fighting the jihadists in Mali. He served in a UN force there, and reportedly "showed bravery" in the face of a "complex attack" by militants in the northern Timbuktu region - famous for its centuries-old buildings -  in 2018.The following year, he participated in a military operation codenamed Otapuanu in Burkina Faso's restive east for seven months. He also served in a detachment of Markoye in the northern Sahel region and took part in several operations there."Traore is close to his men, wilful and courageous. He could not do six months without going to a detachment," an unnamed source was quoted as saying on Burkina Faso's Radio Omega.But Capt Traoré  is no decorated war general, only a captain who studied at a local military academy, joined the army in 2009 and received artillery training in Morocco.He chose a military career after completing his schooling in Burkina Faso's second city, Bobo-Dioulasso, with reports describing him as "shy and rather reserved" but also "very intelligent".Now, Capt Traoré has found himself at the centre of international glare, with some going as far as drawing parallels between him and Burkina Faso's famous revolutionary, Thomas Sankara - not surprising in a nation looking for political saviours after decades of misrule."Ibrahim Traoré has taken over the leadership of the country, like a certain Thomas Sankara, [and] like him after a military coup, captain like him, 34 years old like him. Is this a twist of fate for a Burkina in search of new landmarks?" the privately-owned Wakat Sera website asked.Are military takeovers on the rise in Africa?Why African states are buying Turkish dronesHow Russia has outflanked Ukraine in AfricaWhy France faces so much anger in West Africa</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Frances Mao"><Text>Indonesians are demanding answers after a football match between two rival clubs turned into one of the worst disasters in the sport's history.On Saturday night, thousands of fans rushed onto the pitch after their home team lost a game at Kanjuruhan stadium in Malang, East Java. Police responded by firing tear gas.In the panic to escape, people were trampled and crushed at the exits. At least 125 - including dozens of children, one as young as three - were killed, the authorities say.Some fans died in the arms of the players they had come to cheer on just hours earlier, the coach of home team Arema FC revealed."I can only mention a terrifying scenario," Sergio Silva, a Portuguese star for the side said. "Police cars on fire, everything broken, corridors with blood, people's shoes."People were desperate, they had seen people die and were trying to escape," he told Portuguese sports newspaper, A Bola.Authorities on Monday launched an investigation - following allegations of heavy-handed policing. Public anger has escalated - with mourners chanting "murderers" at officials. At least 18 police officers are being investigated for their action on field.So how did this all unfold? Here's what we know so far.There had been concerns in the lead-up to the game - between Arema FC and long-time rivals, Persebaya Surabaya, another East Java-based team - as violence between fans was not unprecedented. So extra precautions were put in place - including more security "for preventive measures", Maike Ira Puspita, deputy secretary-general of the Indonesian Football Association, told the BBC.They also banned visiting Persebaya fans from coming to the match, meaning it was just a home crowd - an over-capacity attendance of 42,000 people - who roared on their team on Saturday night.The FA also deployed extra police. And during the game's first half, all was "manageable". "The security happening like usual," says Ms Puspita. "Half-time was ok."Eyewitnesses have disputed this, telling the BBC there was scuffles at half time with tensions building throughout the second half.When the game ended, Arema had lost 3-2. "And this is the point when some of the supporters ran onto the pitch. And it all just started to break out from there," Ms Puspita said.It is unclear - and in fierce contention - what exactly happened next. Authorities are unwilling to even specify a chronology of what happened on the field."I think it's better for all of us to wait for the investigation team," Ms Puspita told the BBC.But what is known is that after the final whistle blew, Arema fans moved onto the pitch, where the team's footballers were gathered in the middle. Police had already escorted Persebaya to their changing rooms, the BBC's Indonesian service reported.Sergio Silva said many of those streaming onto the field had appeared to come to "show support, not attack". But recognising the situation was escalating, the team returned to the changing rooms.At some point, police began to fire tear gas into the thousands-strong crowd, volleys aimed at dispersing them. One eyewitness told the BBC that police fired tear gas rounds "continuously and fast".Witnesses say police were unnecessarily brutal - and that along with the clouds of stinging gas, officers were beating fans with batons.The gas had an overwhelming effect - sparking a mass exodus. Fans fled down the field, heading towards the stadium's narrow exits. But with a crowd of thousands beating at each others' backs, and with many still suffering gas inhalation, it became a crush at the gates.In the scrabble to get out, people punched and clawed holes in the wall to try and pull themselves free. The weight of people pushing against the iron gates left them bent outwards. In other places, the crush left some people dying by the changing rooms.Huddled in the locker rooms, Silva said he and his teammates spent what felt like hours barricading themselves. They heard the roar of the crowd, the screams of distress in the corridors."People were desperate, they had seen people die and were trying to escape. We ended up letting in some of these people," he said.It was, he said, a scenario more reminiscent "of destruction, of war... nothing to do with football". "Fans died in the arms of players," Javier Roca, the Arema coach, told Spanish broadcaster Cadena Ser. "I'm mentally shattered. I feel a heavy burden, even a heavy responsibility." He added: "I think the police overstepped their mark."The exact death toll is yet to be confirmed. Many fans are undergoing treatment, and some of those injured are reported have suffered brain injuries.Police have characterised what happened as a riot in which two officers also died. They've accused fans of attacking officers and damaging cars - the burnt-out wreckage of vehicles can be seen in photographs. But anger against officials is rising: at vigils across the nation, protests have broken out calling for police to be held accountable. In the capital Jakarta, mourners chanted "Murderer! Murderer!" and taped signs reading "Kanjuruhan Massacre" to fences.In Malang, anti-police messages have been graffitied on the Kanjuruhan stadium.On Monday, Mohammad Mahfud Mahmodin, Indonesia's minister for political, legal and security affairs, said the government was asking police to "reveal the perpetrators involved in the crime".He said a soldier had been seen in footage carrying out an unauthorised act, without specifying what it was.Separately, the police have announced an investigation into 18 officers who were "holding the throwing weapons".Indonesia is known for violent flare-ups between rival football supporters. The country's police force also has a record of brutality - and has been criticised for frequently using tear gas, despite it being banned by Fifa, world football's governing body, as a crowd control measure."In many riots in football stadiums, police are accustomed to using tear gas - this is an abnormality that has been normalised," said Fajar Junaedi, a lecturer and football researcher at the Universitas Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta.He noted a case in 2012, where a supporter died from being tear-gassed by police and there was no follow-up investigation.Ms Puspita had earlier declined to answer the BBC's question on whether the police use of tear gas was a standard accepted procedure in the Liga.She stressed the actions organisers had taken earlier in the year to help teams manage crowds, including security workshops for first league clubs and coordination with police."At this point, it is unfair to point fingers. This is something that's a black day for all of us - a tragic and devastating incident," she said.Additional reporting by Raja Lumbanrau off BBC Indonesian</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Katy Watson"><Text>When the results came through on Sunday evening, there were cheers for Lula - as well as tears - but the atmosphere felt more like a sense of relief than outright celebration. This wasn't the first-round victory that his supporters had wished for. The polls released a day before the elections had predicted a 14 percentage point gap between Lula and Bolsonaro. They had hoped Lula could avoid a run-off but they vastly underestimated the support for the right-wing leader."I've never won an election in the first round, it's like destiny wants me to work a bit more," Lula said, trying to reassure people of his chances. "We are going to win the elections again, it's just a question of time."Lula is still the front-runner and his position is still strong. But there is no doubt this has been a blow to the Lula campaign. In the past few weeks, there had been a concerted effort by his supporters to try and encourage wavering voters to choose Lula, to end the Bolsonaro presidency promptly.Lula and Bolsonaro to face run-off in BrazilWhy Brazil's election matters so much to the US'Our candidate isn't perfect, but he beats the alternative'The show of strength from the right - not just from Bolsonaro but prominent Bolsonaristas who were also elected to congress and as state governors - has taken people by surprise."Bolsonarism is much more alive and has a further reach than people had thought and polls had captured," says Esther Solano, a political scientist and Bolsonaro expert."What we underestimated was the network of regional Bolsonarism. We have to rethink how we are failing to measure the true reach of Bolsonarism in daily life across Brazil."In his post-results speech, Bolsonaro adopted a more humble tone than in the past - a break from his often fiery politics about the left. Perhaps a conscious effort to win over those who are still undecided."I know there's a desire to change from people but there are certain changes that can be for the worse," he said. "We tried to show that during the campaign but clearly that didn't get through to the most important layers of society."Bolsonaro vowed to show people how to ensure Brazil wouldn't become Venezuela - it's a common comparison that the far-right makes when criticising the left.In the run-up to this vote, Bolsonaro repeatedly said that the polls were a lie - and to many it looked like he was just a bad loser. But reflecting on Sunday's results, there are people who think that Bolsonaro has a point. It's certainly what Bolsonaro's supporters believe."It's time for liberty, for justice," says teacher Selma Cardoso who said the polls were biased. If Lula wins she's prepared to take action. "We'll go to the streets saying people are making a mistake. It's time to change - but peacefully."But others who support the president threaten to take a more violent approach."There's going to be beautiful blood spilled in this city," Alessandro Ferreira Soares, a parachutist, told me if Lula takes the presidency. "I'm prepared to kill all the socialists and communists in the world."It's these ominous threats that make people worried. These next four weeks are going to be intense - and personal. With two powerful political foes now going head-to-head, the campaign steps up several notches.There's everything to play for in this presidential race - and everything to lose if you're on the wrong side. We saw political violence in the run-up to the first round and there's real fear there will be more of that ahead of the run-off.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Hugh Schofield"><Text>If France wants to lead Europe to a new era of military self-reliance, how come its contribution to the war effort in Ukraine is so small?That is the awkward question being posed by some of the country's top strategic thinkers, who are pushing President Emmanuel Macron to make an urgent decision on more arms to Kyiv.Recent analysis conducted on the ground in Poland and Ukraine shows that the French share of foreign arms deliveries is less than 2%, way behind the US on 49%, but also behind Poland (22%) and Germany (9%)."I was concerned about the reliability of the statistics which showed France low on the list of contributing countries," says François Heisbourg, who is perhaps France's most influential defence analyst."So I went out to the main distribution hub in Poland to see how much in tonnage was actually being delivered, rather than just promised."Unfortunately the figures bore out my fears. France is way down the list - in ninth position."The official reaction to this in Paris is: "Yes, but..." Yes, the aid statistics are unflattering, but there are other factors at work.First, defence officials say the true measure of military help is quality not quantity. Some countries are delivering masses of outdated equipment. France has given 18 Caesar self-propelled artillery units, which are now celebrated along the Ukrainian front-line.France, they add, is like other Western countries in having run down military stocks as part of the post-Cold War peace dividend.Ukraine's Caesars are fully one quarter of France's entire mobile artillery. It cannot offer much more without making itself vulnerable in regions where it is already committed, like the Sahel and the Indo-Pacific."It might look like we are behind other countries, but France has every intention of playing its part," says Gen Jérome Pellistrandi, editor of the National Defence Review.These arguments are not without merit, says Mr Heisbourg. The problem is that by not being more present in theatre, France risks writing itself out of the plot."When I was in Kyiv, everyone was very polite. I had no sense that the Ukrainians disapproved of us," he says. "In a way it was worse. I had the distinct feeling we were becoming irrelevant."For Mr Heisbourg the equation is simple. Ukraine will talk to countries who it knows are likely to deliver the weapons it needs. France at the moment is not one of them.But there is another danger for France. Its relative absence in Ukraine undermines its bid for leadership in the cause of European defence.Already many countries of eastern Europe are wary of President Macron, who they believe was far too indulgent towards Russia's Vladimir Putin in the first months of the war. A narrative has taken root according to which France still feels ambivalent about an outright Ukrainian triumph.For Pierre Haroche, who lectures on international security at Queen Mary University of London, this narrative is unfair - and is not the reason for France's low levels of arms deliveries to Ukraine.However, he is firmly of the view that France should beef up its contribution as early as possible, in order to reassure eastern European countries like Poland that "we are all on the same page". "France's goal of strategic autonomy for Europe is focused primarily on building up our defence industries via joint procurement. But if you want joint procurement, you have to demonstrate to other countries that you have the same vision about our common security," he says."In order to make our objective of European co-operation viable, we need to show eastern European countries that co-operating with France and buying the idea of strategic autonomy is not a strategic risk."Dr Haroche is calling for France to send 50 Leclerc main battle tanks. Mr Heisbourg would prefer air defence systems, which he says Ukraine is more in need of."It is like a fire extinguisher," says Dr Haroche. "If there is a fire in a neighbour's house it is better to offer your extinguisher straightaway, and not wait till the fire reaches your own home."It's not just generosity. It's also for your own protection." </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Navin Singh Khadka"><Text>Renowned US ski mountaineer Hilaree Nelson, who died in the Himalayas a week ago, was cremated on Sunday in a Buddhist ceremony in Nepal's capital Kathmandu. Fellow climbers have been telling the BBC how she was an inspirational figure to a generation of women.In 2012 Hilaree Nelson became the first woman to climb Everest (8,849m; 29,032 feet) and its neighbour, Lhotse (8,516m), within 24 hours. Six years later she was back on Lhotse, and she and her partner, Jim Morrison, became the first to ski down the mountain.On Monday 26 September, the couple were skiing down another Himalayan mountain, Manaslu (8,163m), when they triggered an avalanche that swept Hilaree Nelson over a cliff to her death, at the age of 49.Many of those paying tribute to her have noted that she was the equal of any male climber."She was doing things with top male mountain athletes, side by side," said Dave Watson, an international mountain guide who was on Mt Manaslu with Nelson and Morrison, before the couple left to climb to the summit."Her efforts were erasing the label of 'first male'/ 'first female' - it was 'first person'."She was a ground-breaking mountain sports athlete, and she did it with grace and a big smile. Hilaree's influence cannot be overstated."The 36-year-old Swedish climber and adventure athlete, Maria Granberg, who attended Hilaree Nelson's funeral, described her as a trailblazer and a "curious, committed, rare and resilient spirit" who was a role model for younger women."She led expeditions reaching out a hand to the younger generation to follow, showing the ropes, and our future selves got the memo of how to show up as an athlete and human being."In the most human way, she paved the way and shed a light on everything that we as female athletes aspire to become, by creating a life and career coloured by grace, grit and wild aspirations."Another younger climber, Melissa Arnot Reid - the first American woman to climb Everest without supplemental oxygen - met Hilaree Nelson on Everest 10 years ago, on the expedition when Nelson achieved the double of Everest and Lhotse in 24 hours. "She was so strong, so driven but had such willingness to be vulnerable," she told the BBC."As a female in this industry, it's so difficult to be vulnerable without seeming weak, but she did that perfectly and in doing so, showed me what was possible."Her mountain skills and fitness and drive were incredible, but I'm certain she will mostly be remembered for remaining exceptionally human while doing superhuman things."Hilaree Nelson carried out more than 40 expeditions in 16 countries, from the high Himalayas to one of the most remote mountains in Myanmar, and also Antarctica, where in 2020 she climbed the continent's two highest peaks - and skied down both.Billi Bierling, who heads the Himalayan database - keeping records of all expeditions on the Nepalese Himalayas - met Ms Nelson after her record-breaking ski descent from Lhotse in 2018."It was amazing to meet her, she was a great ski mountaineer," she says."The whole mountaineering scene is still very much in male hands. You do have some amazing women climbers, but Hilaree was an extreme skier too, while mountain skiing is also mainly male-dominated."Dave Watson, who was on Manaslu with Hilaree Nelson and Jim Morrison before they left for the summit, says he decided to stay put at camp three, because there were strong winds and a risk of avalanches. In fact, on the same day that the couple reached the summit there was another avalanche that killed one Sherpa and injured more than a dozen other climbers.Jim Morrison got down safely, though, after seeing Hilaree Nelson swept away, and was one of those who found her body on Wednesday.The outpouring of grief seen among the mountaineering community is a sign of how badly it has been rocked by her death, Ms Bierling says."She was a loving and a committed mother of two beautiful children."But by the same token, she fulfilled her dreams and she was beautiful and always very humble."</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Orla Guerin"><Text>As Russia's Vladimir Putin announces the annexation of swathes of sovereign Ukrainian territory, issues nuclear threats and mobilises hundreds of thousands of reservists, the response from Ukrainian forces on the eastern front is unchanged - they will fight for every last inch of soil.We travel to front-line positions in the city of Bakhmut in Donetsk - one of the four regions which President Putin is now illegally claiming as his own. Our journey is made in stages.We slow down to cross the Bakhmutovka river, speed up to cover exposed ground, then weave through a dangerous curtain of downed power lines. For the last few metres, we run. All the while, the shelling is constant - part of war's familiar soundscape.But when we reach the front-line troops, inside a battle-scarred building, we hear something else - the crackle of small arms fire. The two sides are so close they can target each other with rifles.The Russians are around 400 metres (437 yards) in front of us, and trying hard to close in. We are warned there is a Russian sniper to the rear. At his post below ground, where a ginger cat keeps him company, the unit commander is sombre and blunt. "It's pretty hard here now," says Oleksandr, a 31-year-old. "It's stressful. Everyone is under pressure. The enemy is very near, but we are standing and fighting back."He dismisses President Putin's recent referendums as "delusional" and says Ukrainians will not be dictated to at the barrel of a Russian gun. "In my view, those referendums will change nothing. We will fight Putin's army and make them withdraw from our land," he says. Oleksandr knows the cost of war - and not only from fighting his own battles."My brother died," he tells me, adding: "But I don't know where and when that happened, because he was drafted by a different drafting office from a different region. He died as well as a few of my comrades, officers who trained with me. I found out they were dead, too. So, I have lost family and friends."He has not lost his will to fight. Neither has 25-year-old Roman, who is operating a key weapon in this war - a drone.Roman is upstairs in a bombed-out room, littered with debris and broken glass, where two more cats are in residence. The screensaver on his phone is a picture of his five-month-old son Kyrylo, born since the war broke out. He has seen his only child once. "I see him in pictures and video, not in real life," he says. "It's hard, but it's also hard to imagine what the Russians could do to my family if they reach them. "I don't want them to do what they did in Bucha. I lived in Kyiv, and I understand clearly how the women feel. If we are weak, they will come for our families."There is concern here about the mobilisation in Russia. In the coming months the Kremlin will be sending many more soldiers into battle.It is unclear how well-trained or well-equipped they will be, but the Ukrainians are worried about the quantity, not the quality. They are already outnumbered. In the battle for Bakhmut they have faced a seemingly endless supply of Russian fighters. In August there were five waves in a row, according to Iryna, an army spokeswoman."They just go, and they don't stop. They don't react to firing or shelling. Some of the prisoners of war we captured were from Wagner [a Russian mercenary group]. They had better weapons," Iryna says. Troops here believe the Russians are pushing hard for victory in Bakhmut because of their recent humiliating defeats in the north-east and the south, where Ukraine reclaimed about 6,000 sq km (2,317 sq miles) of territory.For now, Bakhmut is stuck in President Putin's throat. It is an obstacle in his bid to swallow all of a mineral rich area known as Donbas - comprised of Donestk and Luhansk.  Having failed to fully capture Donbas, he has annexed both regions.As he tries to conquer Bakhmut - once home to about 70,000 people - the city has been bled of life.Downtown we see a large apartment block with the centre gouged out by an airstrike three months ago. Many of the windows are boarded up. It looks abandoned, but my colleague hears a woman's cry inside the building.We call out, and Lyudmila appears from behind the plastic sheeting that covers her window on the second floor. At first, it is difficult to hear her over the deep rumble of rocket fire."It's very hard," she shouts. "They bombard us. Yesterday a man was killed in the backyard [by shelling]. There's almost no-one left in the building. "Everything is leaking. There is water everywhere. All the walls are cracked. It is very difficult. But at least we get humanitarian aid. Every three days, they bring bread."The white-haired pensioner is living in the shattered building with her husband and a handful of others. "We can't go anywhere," she tells us. "We have no money, and I am in a wheelchair." A neighbour tells us the building has been hit five times. Lyudmila was in her kitchen when the missile struck on 1 July. "It came, out of the blue," she says. "God himself saved me."But can this city be saved?For now, the frontline is holding. Ukrainian forces are blocking the Russian advance. But here even the dead are not safe.There is an old cemetery on the city's green outskirts, in the path of incoming shells. Mounds of dark soil top the fresh graves - those killed in recent months, since the city became a battleground.As a coffin is lowered into the ground - watched by a few mourners - the silence is broken by shelling. The first launch is outgoing, but moments later an incoming round lands in the hills opposite the graveyard. Then a second strike, closer still. It is time to leave.As we race towards the edge of Bakhmut there is an explosion on the road right in front of us, between 100 to 200 metres ahead. We manage a sharp left turn and follow another route out.Many battles are still raging in Ukraine. President Putin is doubling down - and winter is coming.This is a dangerous new phase in Europe's newest war.When asked how long she thought the conflict would last, the army spokeswoman replied: "A long, long time."</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Bernd Debusmann Jr and Alexandra Ostasiewicz"><Text>For Renee Smith and her paralysed, cancer-stricken husband Christopher, evacuation was not an option when Hurricane Ian came violently bearing down on their Florida home. "It would have taken an ambulance, a stretcher, and three grown men to move him," she said of Christopher, who became paralysed just days before the hurricane as a result of prostate cancer spreading to his spine. "I had no control and it was terrifying."Without any other choices, Mrs Smith resorted to desperate measures to protect her husband. She used cable ties and gaffer tape to attach a tarpaulin to his hospital bed in a bid to keep him dry and used his wheelchair to barricade the front door from the 150mph (241km/h) winds. Even that, she feared, may have not been enough. "I'm his caretaker, so I stayed," she told the BBC from her home in Punta Gorda - one of the Gulf Coast communities hardest hit by the category four storm. "I put a life preserver around his neck, kissed him and told him I loved him."In Mrs Smith's case, the danger primarily came from the hurricane's ferocious winds. Many others were hit by a powerful storm surge. Suzie Mack, a Fort Myers resident, told the BBC that her brother's mobile home park saw water as high as 8ft during the storm. "They got on their air mattresses inside their house, because it was too late to leave, and by the time the surge got to its peak, they had about a foot of air left in their homes," she said. "Nobody died there, but it was a horrific story to hear." Not everyone was so lucky. So far, Florida officials have confirmed 44 deaths from the hurricane across the state - most of these in Lee County - with US networks reporting even higher tolls. Hurricane Ian - Maps and images showing destructionIn Pictures: Floridians take in Hurricane Ian's impactIn Ian's wake, some Florida residents have come under criticism for failing to heed repeated warnings and calls to evacuate. But for families like the Smiths and hundreds of thousands of others, logistical and financial hurdles to evacuation meant that staying was the only option. Others were simply trapped by bad luck.A woman who identified herself as Melodye, for example, fled from her home in the Tampa Bay area to Fort Myers. By the time it was clear that Ian's track had shifted south, it was too late for her to leave. "My area turned out to be safe, never got hit," she told the BBC at a mobile home park near Fort Myers. "I came down here and experienced the worst thing I've ever experienced in my whole life.""If there is another, I'm going to Chicago," she added. While for the moment the scale of Ian's destruction remains unclear, independent experts have warned that the economic impact is likely to be well into the tens of billions of dollars. Consultancy firm Milliman estimated that only 18% of people in areas under evacuation order had flood insurance, putting many residents in difficult or impossible financial situations as they seek to rebuild their homes or recover their losses. Governor Ron DeSantis - who called Ian a "500-year flood event" - said that the storm may well have "changed the character of our state".In these conditions, many Florida residents have been left wondering what their future looks like - and whether to stay in the state or to leave.  Tom, a 48-year-old resident of the town of Port Charlotte, 38 miles (61km) from Fort Myers, told the BBC that he decided to leave the morning after the storm along with his 66-year-old mother, Kathy. While the pair had already planned a move to Colorado, the hurricane prompted them to pack up and leave the morning after Ian passed. "The town is destroyed," Kathy said. So was her home for the last six years.For residents of the Sun Seekers mobile home park in North Fort Myers - many of them transplants from other parts of the US - the government may make the decision to relocate for them by declaring the property "uninhabitable". Cindy Brackett, a resident of the mobile home park, said that the prospect of being forced from her home was an additional and unwelcome trauma, just days after the violent hurricane. "With my arthritis, I can't do anything. I can't even walk out of my home. I feel so useless," Ms Brackett said. She doesn't want to leave and isn't sure where she would go if she had to.Federal officials and the American Red Cross say that about 10,000 displaced people are currently in shelters - not including people who may have taken shelter with friends, family or left the area entirely. State and federal officials have promised millions of dollars in relief funds, but many people on the ground remain sceptical of how - and whether - it will reach them. For those able - and willing - to stay, the effort to rebuild has already begun. Across damaged parts of western Florida, the BBC saw people beginning to clear debris from their homes and businesses, sweeping away palm fronds and parts of shattered houses. In some places, people were working to clear cars that had been overturned or crushed by felled trees, or boats that had been left sitting useless and far from the water."People around here are devastated," said Cal Bruno, the owner of a Fort Myers restaurant that gave away thousands of pasta meals to residents for free after the storm. "But we'll come together." Among those vowing to stay to help with the effort is construction worker Alejandro Carrera, an Argentine immigrant and 14-year resident of Fort Myers. "We will rebuild," he told the BBC, standing just feet from a shattered local marina. "I work in construction. I'm going to have a ton of work."Phoebe Gavin, a Washington-DC based native of Sanibel Island - whose aging parents fled across a causeway to nearby Fort Myer just ahead of the storm - said that she's "pessimistic" about the island's immediate reconstruction. Sanibel - which is located just off the coast and has a population of about 6,000 - was among the hardest-hit communities during the hurricane.Parts of the causeway connecting the barrier island to Florida were destroyed during the storm, severing access from the rest of the state. "I can't see it as a top priority as far as rebuilding," she said. "It would be shocking to me if we saw previous levels of road traffic within the next year."  A lack of connectivity to the mainland, she said, would be devastating to a community which survives largely on tourism. The alternative to a working causeway - a ferry - could potentially drive tourists away. "A lot of people would choose a much easier option," she said. Just across the shattered causeway in Fort Myers, pensioner Lucia Kim said that while she is confident that local communities will get back to normal sooner than later, she fears that some of the "spirit" of the area might be lost. "There is an atmosphere here," said Ms Kim, who moved from New York a decade ago attracted by the freedom and sense of community. "Just look at the 1960s architecture as well," she added, gesturing at art deco buildings in the distance. "Who knows what comes next?" After Hurricane Ian passed, Renee Smith cautiously emerged from her home to survey the damage.What she found wasn't encouraging. Her driveway remains covered in debris and detritus from nearby buildings, including some items she immediately recognised as having been ripped from a four-storey hotel blocks away. To make matters worse, Mrs Smith's front door won't shut, her chimney has collapsed and parts of her roof were blown away, leaving her and her bedridden husband partially exposed to the elements. Mrs Smith, however, sees things that may suggest that the damage in her devastated community could ultimately lead to a stronger and more resilient neighbourhood. Many of the buildings rebuilt after previous hurricanes - such as 2004's Hurricane Charley - managed to weather the storm better than the rest of the town. In any case, her husband's condition means that rain or shine, she'll be staying put. She has no choice.  For the moment, however, she is simply happy that mother nature has given her a reprieve. Since Hurricane Ian passed, the sun is back out while Florida's often oppressive heat has been replaced by more comfortable temperatures. "We're very fortunate," she said of the conditions after the storm. "It could have been a lot worse."Additional reporting from John Sudworth and Azadeh Moshiri</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Orla Guerin"><Text>Victory can look desolate. It does inside the eastern Ukrainian town of Lyman, retaken from the Russians at the weekend. The deserted debris-strewn streets are lined by boarded up or burnt-out buildings. Metal sheeting dangling from smashed roofs is buffeted by the wind. Few civilians venture out. We counted almost as many dogs as people - though the population was around 20,000 before the war.The handful of civilians we met seem shell-shocked by months of bombardment, and uncertain their ordeal is over.The only surge of life was a convoy of Ukrainian troops riding high on top of armoured personnel carriers, waving and cheering, as they headed out of town, along a road bordered by pine forest.They roared past evidence of the human cost of Russia's defeat.The bodies of five dead Russian soldiers lay near each other, now bloated, and contorted by death, but once somebody's husband or somebody's son. They were in full uniform, with boots still on, as if they might somehow return to the fight.  They appear to have been cut down together as they tried to flee. Nearby we saw a heap of discarded Russian uniforms, sleeping bags, and ration packs. There was an army backpack with a name written on it. We don't know what became of its owner. Two young volunteers from a Ukrainian humanitarian group were working carefully and quietly, numbering the bodies, and looking for anything that might identify them.   They were kneeling just metres away from mines scattered along the roadside, their dark green colour camouflaged by the grass and leaves. They are a lingering threat from an enemy that has been driven into retreat, or as Russia's defence ministry put it, was "withdrawn to more advantageous positions". That statement has a familiar ring to it after the domino of Russian routs last month in Kharkiv province in the north-east.Later the volunteers manoeuvred the remains into black body bags and drove them away - some of Russia's fallen soldiers finally leaving the battlefield.A new Ukrainian flag was flying atop a captured Russian T72  tank, parked by the roadside. "We are going to win," said the smiling young Ukrainian soldier clambering around the gun turret. "I feel very good, very great." What happened here isn't just a defeat for President Vladimir Putin. It's a complete humiliation. Just last Friday he announced to the world he was annexing four Ukrainian regions, including Donetsk, where Lyman is located. He proclaimed that they would be "Russian forever".A day later Ukrainian forces were inside Lyman, and his troops were running for their lives.Ukraine says as many as 5,000 Russian troops were encircled in Lyman, before the town fell. We don't know how many were killed or captured. The defence ministry in Kyiv said in a tweet that almost all the Russian troops deployed to Lyman had been "redeployed either into body bags or into captivity".The strategic town is a gateway to the neighbouring region of Luhansk, which is almost entirely in Russia's grip. Ukraine is hoping to advance further, using its victory here as a springboard.Lena and her 10-year-old Radion are hoping for peace, and for running water.  We met the mother and son heading for a well to refill a five-litre container."I think it will be peaceful," said Lena, who wore a black hat and a few layers of woollen jumpers, "It should be peaceful. Everyone has suffered enough. The hardest thing was to survive the shelling. We prayed as we stayed in the cellar. The situation is still tense but overall, I am happy."While deprived of school, Radion has learnt the lessons of war. His face is sombre, beneath his deep blue hat. "It was a bit scary in Lyman," he tells us "because there was a lot of bombing. War is very bad because people are dying. It's more peaceful in my heart now."Others here still seem lost in their trauma, like 66-year-old Nadia. She was alone on the streets, walking slowly, as if she could not recognise her surroundings."I hope for the best," she said "and that they [the Russians] won't come back here. It was very bad. Both sides were firing. We didn't understand anything. When it was quiet, we went outside to cook. Then it started again. We have all gone mad now."And she had a question for us. "Why am I being bombarded?" she beseeched us. "I didn't do anything bad. I didn't kill. I didn't steal. I don't understand why. Maybe you can tell me. We lived well, everything was good, we worked.  And in one moment it was turned upside down."In the streets around town pro-Russian slogans have been daubed on walls, kiosks and bus shelters. "CCCP" is daubed on a closed shop front - the Cyrillic letters for USSR, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.Much as President Putin may wish to resurrect the Soviet Union of his youth, the ruins of Lyman stand as testament to his failure.Ukraine now has momentum and knows it must move fast, Western weapons supplies permitting. Battle lines will harden when freezing weather comes. The window for reclaiming more territory this winter may close in a few weeks. </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Laurence Peter and Matt Murphy"><Text>Ukrainian troops have retaken more territory in regions illegally annexed by Russia, with Kyiv's forces advancing near the southern city of Kherson and consolidating gains in the east. Russian-installed officials in Kherson confirmed the advance, but said Moscow's forces were digging in.Ukrainian troops also moved towards Russian-held Luhansk in the east.Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said "there are new liberated settlements in several regions".Speaking during his nightly address, President Zelensky said "fierce fighting continues in many areas", but he did not give details. The progress of Ukraine's counterattacks have been closely guarded and reporters have largely been kept away from the front lines.But in the south, Vladimir Saldo, the Russian-installed leader in the Kherson region, admitted that Ukrainian forces had broken through near Dudchany, a town on the Dnipro river about 30km (20 miles) south of the previous front line. The river is called Dnieper by Russians."There are settlements that are occupied by Ukrainian forces," Mr Saldo said. Some Russian reports say the Ukrainians have now taken Dudchany.Russian defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said "numerically superior" Ukrainian tanks had "driven a deep wedge" south of Zolota Balka, a village that marked the previous front line on the Dnipro. He claimed the Russians had killed about 130 Ukrainian troops in that fighting.According to Mr Saldo, two Ukrainian battalions tried to reach the Kakhovka hydroelectric station, about 70km (44 miles) east of Kherson. The power station is in the port city of Nova Kakhovka. The Ukrainian advance is targeting supply lines for as many as 25,000 Russian troops on the west bank of the Dnipro, Reuters news agency reports.Meanwhile, in the east, Kyiv's troops have continued an advance that has made inroads into Luhansk, a province annexed by Moscow last week and previously under almost complete Russian control. On Saturday, Ukrainian forces recaptured the important hub town of Lyman in the east, near the Luhansk regional border. Russia's military had turned Lyman into a logistical base.A commander of Russia's proxy forces in Luhansk said Ukrainian troops had pushed a few kilometres into the region before being killed. The BBC cannot confirm these claims. And reports suggest that the Ukrainians are moving towards the Russian-held towns of Kreminna and Svatove in Luhansk, with some pro-Kremlin bloggers suggesting that Russian forces have again been ordered to retreat.Kherson and Luhansk are among four regions which Russian President Vladimir Putin has declared to be part of Russia, following so-called referendums denounced as fraudulent by Kyiv and its Western allies. Russia does not fully control any of the four regions.On Monday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov attracted ridicule online after he admitted that Russia was still deciding which areas it had "annexed", suggesting that Moscow does not know where its self-declared borders are. Mr Peskov claimed the entirety of Luhansk and Donetsk regions were part of Russia, but said the Kremlin would "continue consultations with the population regarding the borders of the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions". Kyiv has vowed to retake all the territory annexed by Russia, including Crimea, seized by Russian troops in 2014.The Russian defence ministry says reservists drafted under Mr Putin's mobilisation order last month are undergoing intensive combat training in the Russian-controlled Luhansk and Donetsk regions. The Kremlin plans to call up about 300,000 reservists - though Mr Putin did not set an upper limit.ANALYSIS: Who is winning the war in Ukraine?ON THE GROUND: What weapons are being supplied to Ukraine?READ MORE: Full coverage of the crisis</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By David Gritten"><Text>Schoolgirls in Iran have been waving their headscarves in the air and chanting against clerical authorities, in an unprecedented show of support for the protests engulfing the country.Videos verified by the BBC showed demonstrations inside schoolyards and on the streets of several cities.They echoed the wider unrest sparked by the death last month of a woman who was detained for breaking the hijab law.In Karaj, girls reportedly forced an education official out of their school.Footage posted on social media on Monday showed them shouting "shame on you" and throwing what appear to be empty water bottles at the man until he retreats through a gate.The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterIn another video from Karaj, which is just to the west of the capital Tehran, students are heard shouting: "If we don't unite, they will kill us one by one." In the southern city of Shiraz on Monday, dozens of schoolgirls blocked traffic on a main road while waving their headscarves in the air and shouting "death to the dictator" - a reference to the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the final say on all state matters.The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterFurther protests by schoolgirls were reported on Tuesday in Karaj, Tehran and the north-western cities of Saqez and Sanandaj.A number of students were also photographed standing in their classrooms with their heads uncovered. Some were raising their middle fingers - an obscene gesture - at portraits of Ayatollah Khamenei and the founder of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.Analysis by Rana Rahimpour, BBC PersianAfter almost three weeks of protests, it is clear that Iran's leadership is facing a serious challenge. Its opponents are no longer just politicians or people in their 20s. It is now facing teenagers - schoolgirls who are not scared of burning photos of the supreme leader.The protests have continued despite Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's warning on Monday that they were "riots" orchestrated by the West. Many of those taking part simply want a normal life. They might not understand politics, but they understand that they are not free to live their lives the way they want. Now, every school and university could potentially become a headquarters for the protesters. Every day at school, teenagers will be able to get together and exchange ideas about how to overthrow the regime. The question is whether and how the Islamic Republic will be able to stop them. The protests by the schoolgirls began hours after Ayatollah Khamenei, who has final say on all state matters, broke his silence on the unrest and accused the United States and Israel, Iran's arch-enemies, of orchestrating "riots".  He also gave his full backing to the security forces, which have responded to the protests with a violent crackdown.The unrest was triggered by the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish woman who fell into a coma after being detained by morality police on 13 September in Tehran for allegedly violating the law requiring women to cover their hair with a hijab, or headscarf. She died in hospital three days later.Her family has alleged that officers beat her head with a baton and banged her head against one of their vehicles. The police have denied that she was mistreated and said she suffered "sudden heart failure".The first protests took place in Kurdish-populated north-western Iran, where Ms Amini lived, and then spread rapidly across the country. Iran Human Rights, a Norway-based group, reported on Tuesday that at least 154 people had been killed by security forces so far. They include 63 protesters whom ethnic Baluch activists said had died in clashes in the south-eastern city of Zahedan on Friday.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Elsa Maishman"><Text>At least four people have been killed and dozens are missing after an avalanche struck a team of mountaineers high in the Indian Himalayas.The 34 trainees and seven instructors were practising navigation when they were hit on their descent from a peak in the northern state of Uttarakhand. Eight of the party are believed to have been rescued and the rest are trapped in a crevasse, rescuers say.Search efforts have been paused for the night because of rain and snowfall.Local media reports say the number of casualties may rise significantly. The group was made up of trainees from the nearby Nehru Institute of Mountaineering. It said they had been returning from Mount Draupadi Danda-2 (5,670m; 18,602 feet) when the avalanche struck. Authorities were alerted at around 09:30 local time on Tuesday (04:00 GMT), rescue workers said. "We have confirmation of four deaths out of the 33 people trapped. Around eight of them have already been rescued and the rest are trapped in a crevasse," Ridhim Aggarwal from the State Disaster Response Force told AFP news agency. Rescue efforts will continue as long as the weather allows, he said. Earlier, Uttarakhand police chief Ashok Kumar told Reuters news agency: "The Indian Air Force is doing an aerial recce of the mountain where this happened. It is not easy to reach the spot." Defence Minister Rajnath Singh wrote on Twitter: "Deeply anguished by the loss of precious lives due to landslide which has struck the mountaineering expedition carried out by the Nehru Mountaineering Institute in Uttarkashi."It comes a week after the body of famed US ski mountaineer Hilaree Nelson was found in the Nepali Himalayas. Ms Nelson, regarded as one of the greatest mountaineers of her generation, was reported to have fallen into a deep crevasse after reaching the summit of Mount Manaslu.On the same day she went missing, one person was killed and more than a dozen injured in an avalanche lower down on the same peak.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Hugh Schofield"><Text>Paris has become the latest French city to announce that it will not be setting up giant screens and fan zones for the approaching World Cup in Qatar.It cited human rights and environmental concerns in the host nation.Lille, Marseille, Bordeaux, Strasbourg and Reims are also boycotting the competition on ethical grounds.Pierre Rabadan, in charge of sport at Paris City Hall, said the fact the event was taking place in winter was also a factor in the city's decision.The movement began on Saturday after the Socialist mayor of Lille, Martine Aubry, declared that the Qatar World Cup was a "nonsense in terms of human rights, the environment and sport".Like other mayors - of both left and right - she blamed concerns over workers' rights in Qatar; the alleged high number of deaths among foreign labourers; and the environmental impact of the stadiums, all equipped with outdoor air conditioning.In Marseille, there had been plans for a giant screening if France made it to the final, but that has now been cancelled.The city's Socialist mayor, Benoit Payan, said the competition "had progressively turned itself into a human and environmental catastrophe, incompatible with the values which we expect sport - and especially football - to promote".It was unclear how many French cities were actually making preparations for outdoor venues where supporters could follow the progress of the French team, world champions in Russia 2018.The mayor of Angoulême in south-west France said his decision was as much financial as to do with human rights in Qatar.Why is the Qatar World Cup so controversial?FA criticised for 'delay' over Qatar statement"It seemed incongruous to us to risk this kind of expense at a time when we are trying to make economies to absorb the growing cost of energy," said Xavier Bonnefont, citing a giant screen cost of "several tens of thousands of euros"."In any case frankly in winter I don't think there would have been many people turning up. The public will be just as happy in a bar."Calls for a boycott of the World Cup, which takes place between 21 November and 18 December, have been growing in France, though they remain far from mainstream.The former international and Manchester United star Eric Cantona said he would not be watching any matches, adding: "Let's be honest, this World Cup makes no sense. It is an aberration."Government spokesman Olivier Véran said: "If we were to make the decision today, we would not give the World Cup to Qatar.  However when something was decided 10 years ago by 100 countries, it's difficult to say stop just a few weeks before it gets under way."</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="BBC News, author unspecified"><Text>Twitter shares have been suspended following a report that Elon Musk will proceed with a takeover of the social media platform.Mr Musk is set to buy Twitter at the original price he offered months ago before he walked away from a deal, sources told US media.Shares in Twitter were up almost 13% before trading was halted.Mr Musk was due to face Twitter in court later this month after he tried to pull out of the takeover.Mr Musk offered to pay $54.20 per share for the company in April, in a deal that valued the social media platform at $44bn.But he balked at the deal just a few weeks later, citing concerns that the number of bots on the platform was higher than Twitter claimed.Twitter denied the accusations and sued Mr Musk to force the deal to go through.The back-and-forth came amid a sharp downturn in the value of technology stocks, including Tesla, the electric car company that Mr Musk leads and is the base of much of his wealth. Twitter accused Mr Musk of wanting out because he was worried about the price.The fight between Mr Musk and Twitter, which was scheduled to go to trial 17 October, had ensnarled many of the biggest names in tech, as lawyers for the two companies demanded communications about the deal.Mr Musk, who could have paid a $1bn break-up fee to walk away from the deal, was set to be interviewed ahead of the trial this week.Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said Mr Musk's chance of winning was "highly unlikely"."Being forced to do the deal after a long and ugly court battle in Delaware was not an ideal scenario and instead accepting this path and moving forward with the deal will save a massive legal headache," he wrote in a report after the news.But he added, that Mr Musk's ownership of the platform, a top venue for politicians and journalists to spread news and opinion, would still likely to cause a "firestorm of worries and questions" in Washington and beyond.It's never dull with Musk. Elon Musk has for months now been trying to get out of this deal. In doing so he has argued that Twitter is full of bots.He has said on multiple occasions that Twitter may have many times more fake accounts than it admits to.By making these claims he has helped to tarnish the reputation of the company.Advertisers are nervous - they want to buy ads that are seen by humans, with wallets, not bots.So for Elon Musk to then offer to buy the company again, at the initial price, seems bizarre.Twitter is reportedly looking at Mr Musk's offer closely. Musk's behaviour in this deal has so far been erratic. Could this be a legal strategy to delay a court case?But if this reported offer is credible it's a massive win for Twitter's shareholders and its lawyers. Many Twitter employees, however, will be less pleased. I've spoken to several employees who are privately nervous about a Musk takeover, and what that might mean for moderation policies - and more acutely - their own job security.And as for Twitter's CEO Parag Agrawal? Well emails disclosed last week suggests he doesn't get along well with Musk.A Musk Twitter takeover would almost certainly mean a new person in charge of the company.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="BBC News, author unspecified"><Text>A Nigerian boy has been killed by his brother while testing a newly bought "bullet-proof" charm, police say.The two believed they had "fortified themselves with the protective charm", according to police in Kwara stateAbubakar Abubakar then shot at his younger brother Yusuf, 12, using their father's rifle, officers say.

He was then arrested for kicking an officer while in custody.Gilman told the court in Voronezh, south-western Russia, that he did not remember the incident but "apologised to Russia" and to the officer.After being found guilty, Gilman - 28 and from Massachusetts - said the sentence requested by the prosecution was too strict.The lawyers told TASS, the Russian state news agency, that Gilman was in Russia to study and obtain citizenship. Gilman was reportedly staying in Sochi, but headed by train to Moscow to replace his damaged passport at the US Embassy.His lawyers said they would appeal against the court's decision and contact US officials to seek a prisoner exchange.There have been several high-profile cases of Americans being sentenced to lengthy prison terms in Russia recently. This could lead to prisoner swaps, a process often seen as "hostage diplomacy", where countries try to use people as bargaining chips. Another ex-marine, Trevor Reed, was freed in April in a prisoner swap after being found guilty of violence against a police officer on a night out in Russia.And another former US marine, Paul Whelan, is serving 16 years for spying charges after a short trial was conducted entirely behind closed doors.He maintains his innocence, and describes himself the victim of "greasy, slimy Russian politics".How Brittney Griner's case throws spotlight on hostage diplomacyUS basketball star Brittney Griner was sentenced to nine years in prison on drug charges by a Russian court in August.The double Olympic winner admitted possessing cannabis oil, but told the court she had made an "honest mistake".The US claims she's being wrongfully detained.

They asked for privacy as they grieve and said a memorial would be announced later.  The singer was born Loretta Webb in a one-room log cabin in Butcher Hollow, Kentucky in 1932. She was the second of eight children.Just as she would later sing in Coal Miner's Daughter, her family eked out a living during the Depression, with her father earning a "poor man's dollar" by working all night in the coal mines, and all day in the fields "a-hoein' corn".The family made its own entertainment - her mother played guitar, with her father accompanying on banjo - and she grew up on the songs of the Carter Family."I was singing when I was born, I think," she told the Associated Press in 2016. "Daddy used to come out on the porch where I would be singing and rocking the babies to sleep. "He'd say, 'Loretta, shut that big mouth. People all over this holler can hear you.' And I said, 'Daddy, what difference does it make? They are all my cousins.'"At the age of 15, she attended a "pie social" - where local girls would bake a pie, and men would bid to win both the food and a meeting with the cook. Loretta's pie, accidentally baked with salt instead of sugar, was won by Oliver Lynn, a 21-year-old solider, who swept her off her feet. A month later, they married and moved to Custer, Washington, where they raised four children.Her husband, whom she called "Doo" or "Doolittle," urged her to sing professionally and bought her a $17 (£15) Sears guitar, with which she started a band, Loretta and the Trailblazers, that also featured her brother Jay Lee Webb.By 1960, she had signed a contract with Zero Records and released her debut single, I'm a Honky Tonk Girl. The song was inspired by a woman Lynn befriended in Washington, whose husband had left her for another woman. Lynn said she wrote the song while leaning up against an old toilet in her house, the words pouring out of her in a 10-minute burst of inspiration.She and her husband promoted the song relentlessly, driving to radio stations around the country to pester DJs into playing it, and sending out hundreds of free discs.The effort paid off. I'm A Honky Tonk Girl reached number 14 on the country charts, and Lynn relocated to Nashville, where she was quickly snapped up by Decca Records. She released her first Decca record, Success, in 1962, beginning an impressive stretch of hits that continued into the 1990s.Lynn earned her first number one with Don't Come Home a Drinkin' (With Lovin' on Your Mind) in 1966, and topped the US country charts another 15 times. She recorded 60 albums in total, and was nominated for 18 Grammy Awards, winning three.Her songs frequently depicted broken relationships and unhappy homes - but were unusual for expressing a female point of view at a time when that was unheard of in country music. Many addressed Doolittle's infidelity and alcoholism. You Ain't Woman Enough (To Take My Man) and Fist City were feisty warnings to any woman who considered approaching her husband, while 1971's I Wanna Be Free fantasised about divorce. "I'm gonna take this chain from around my finger / And throw it just as far as I can sling," sang Lynn."I've wrote every song I ever wrote about him," she told a BBC Arena documentary. "He gave me a lot of opportunities."Lynn later confessed that the relationship could turn violent - although she gave as good as she got."If he smacked me or anything, I'd stand up and be fightin' him just like I'd be fightin' the other woman," she told PBS's American Masters documentary in 2016. "He'd smack me, I'd smack him; he'd pull my hair, I pulled his hair. That's the way it was." Despite their troubles, the couple stayed together for 48 years until Oliver's death in 1996.Lynn's songs weren't just about relationships, however. Dear Sam was inspired by the women left at home during the Vietnam War, with lyrics that ran: "Don't misunderstand/ I know he's fighting for our land / I really love my country/ But I also love my man", while The Pill was a frank and funny celebration of reproductive choice. "This old maternity dress I've got is going in the garbage/The clothes I'm wearing from now on won't take up so much yardage," sang the star. "Miniskirts, hot pants and a few little fancy frills/Yeah, I'm making up for all those years since I've got the pill."Although she wasn't initially credited as a writer, it later transpired she had played a part in its composition. Speaking to NPR in 2010, the mother of six said the lyrics spoke directly to her own experiences."If I'd had [the pill] I would have used it," she said. "'Cause back when I was having all the kids, we didn't have birth-control pills. Or if we did, I didn't know anything about them."The subject matter meant her record label held the single back for several years. When it was finally released in 1975, many country radio stations refused to play it, keeping it from hitting number one. But it still reached the top five, and became Lynn's biggest crossover pop hit.By that time, Lynn had begun a professional partnership with country star Conway Twitty, with whom she scored hits like After the Fire Is Gone, Louisiana Woman, Mississippi Man and As Soon As I Hang Up The Phone. The musicians were named vocal duo of the year by the Country Music Association for four consecutive years from 1972 to 1975.Lynn published her autobiography, also called Coal Miner's Daughter, in 1976, and it was turned into a film in 1980, earning Sissy Spacek an Oscar for best actress.The musician's output slowed in the 1980s and she announced her retirement in the 1990s - although she still managed to release a handful of albums, including 1993's Honky Tonk Women, a collaboration with fellow country music trailblazers Dolly Parton and Tammy Wynette. In the meantime, she turned her attention to food, launching a restaurant called Loretta Lynn's Kitchen, and a series of cookbooks that mixed recipes with stories from her life.She also opened the Loretta Lynn Ranch in Tennessee - Lynn's equivalent to Parton's Dollywood - which hosts a museum and campsite, and stages regular music events. In 2004, her career was resurrected by super-fan Jack White, who encouraged her back into the studio for an album that combined his abrasive rock sound with Lynn's penchant for pedal steel and banjo.The album showed that her narrative power was undiminished (one song, Ms Leroy Brown, told of a bored housewife who stole her husband's savings to rent a limousine and go on a bender) and gained her a new audience at the age of 72, as well as the Grammy Award for best country album.In 2013, Lynn was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honour in the United States, by President Barack Obama.Later albums included Full Circle, a mix of new songs and remakes of old standards, and 2021's Still Woman Enough, which saw her duet with Margo Price and Tanya Tucker.Lynn stopped touring in 2017 after a stroke, and suffered a broken hip after falling over at home the following year. But she continued to perform and record, and forcefully denied tabloid reports at the time that her health was failing."Through the years they've said I'm broke, homeless, cheating, drinking, gone crazy, terminally ill, and even dead! Poor things can't ever get it right," she wrote on Facebook. "I guess if those old pesky tabloids are harassing me then they're giving someone else a break... but I'm about an inch from taking 'em to Fist City!"It was that down-to-earth gutsiness that endeared her to fans over the last six decades, and one that ensures her music still feels relevant."I like real life, because that's what we're doing today," she said 2004. "And I think that's why people bought my records, because they're living in this world and so am I. So I see what's going on, and I grab it."Lynn is survived by four of her six children: Clara, Ernest and twins Peggy and Patsy, as well as 17 grandchildren and four step-grandchildren.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Jean Mackenzie, Yvette Tan &amp; Rupert Wingfield-Hayes"><Text>North Korea has fired a ballistic missile over Japan, in what appears to be a deliberate escalation to get the attention of Tokyo and Washington.The missile travelled 4,500km (2,800 miles) before falling into the Pacific Ocean - far enough to hit the US island of Guam if it took another trajectory.It is the North's first missile launch over Japan since 2017. Japan issued an alert to some citizens to take cover.The US, Japan and South Korea conducted their own military drills in response.South Korean and US aircraft fired at a mock target on an uninhabited island in the Yellow Sea, while the US and Japan also jointly carried out drills over the Sea of Japan.The UN prohibits North Korea from testing ballistic and nuclear weapons. Flying missiles towards or over other countries without any warning or consultation also contravenes international norms. Most countries avoid doing it completely as it can easily be mistaken for an attack. While it is not as big as a nuclear test - which could be next - it can be considered hugely provocative.People in the north of Japan, including Hokkaido island and Aomori city, reportedly woke up to the noise of sirens and text alerts which read: "North Korea appears to have launched a missile. Please evacuate into buildings or underground."As the missile flew overhead, they were warned to look out for falling debris. Many remained calm, though, with one video showing Tokyo commuters walking normally as loudspeakers blared out warnings. But others were more shaken. "If a missile hit, I was worried it would be a big problem not only here but also nationwide," Aomori resident Kazuko Ebina told the Asahi Shimbun newspaper.Officials later said the intermediate-range ballistic missile fell into the Pacific Ocean far from Japan, and there were no reported injuries.It had covered the longest distance ever travelled by a North Korean missile, and reached a height of around 1,000km - higher than the International Space Station. Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida described the launch as "violent behaviour", while defence minister Yasukazu Hamada said Japan would not rule out any options to strengthen its defences including "counterattack capabilities". US President Joe Biden reinforced Washington's "ironclad commitment" to Japan's defence during a phone call with Mr Kishida, while the two leaders jointly condemned the missile test, a White House statement said.They confirmed they would work closely with South Korea and the international community to coordinate an immediate and longer-term response to the threat posed by the North, it added.Last week, the three countries conducted naval exercises together for the first time since 2017. Such drills have long antagonised Pyongyang leader Kim Jong-un, who views them as proof that his enemies are preparing for war. Following the combined exercises in 2017, North Korea fired two missiles over Japan in response. A week later, it conducted a nuclear test.Recent intelligence has suggested that North Korea is getting ready to test another nuclear weapon.It is expected that North Korea would wait until after China - its main ally - holds its Communist party congress later this month.But some experts are now asking if it could come sooner than expected - they believe Tuesday's launch shows that North Korea is preparing the ground for a nuclear test.N Korea missile tests: What does Kim Jong-un want?What missiles does North Korea have?North Korea tests banned intercontinental missile The missile launch is the fifth carried out by Pyongyang in a week. On Saturday, two rockets came down in waters outside Japan's exclusive economic zone. Many of North Korea's missile tests are conducted on a high, lofted flight path - reaching a high altitude, avoiding flights over its neighbours.But firing over or past Japan allows North Korean scientists to test missiles under circumstances "that are more representative of the conditions they'd endure in real-world use", analyst Ankit Panda told news agency Reuters.These actions have contributed to enduring tensions between North Korea and Japan, rooted in Japan's colonisation of Korea from 1910 to 1945 and the North's abduction of Japanese citizens in the past.Earlier this month, North Korea passed a law declaring itself to be a nuclear weapons state, with leader Kim Jong-un ruling out the possibility of talks on denuclearisation. Pyongyang conducted six nuclear tests between 2006 and 2017, incurring widespread sanctions. The East Asian state regularly defies the ban on nuclear and missile tests, saying it needs to bolster its defences.Additional reporting by Nathan Williams. </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="BBC News, author unspecified"><Text>North Korea has fired a missile over Japan, which travelled about 4,500km (2,800 miles) before falling into the Pacific Ocean.It has been conducting regular missile tests as part of its weapons programme, but this is the first launch over Japan since 2017.North Korea has carried out more than 30 missile tests this year - using some with a long enough range to reach the US. These include ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and hypersonic missiles.Hypersonic missiles fly at several times the speed of sound and at low altitude, to escape radar detection. The latest missile tested over Japan is thought to be an intermediate-range Hwasong-12, which has a range of 4,500km - far enough to hit the US island of Guam from North Korea."North Korea has been testing missiles with longer and longer ranges," says Joseph Byrne, research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute."This is the longest-range missile it's ever fired over Japan. It could be the precursor to it testing another nuclear warhead, which has been predicted for some time." North Korea has also been testing the Hwasong-14 ballistic missile.This has a range of 8,000km - although some studies have suggested it could travel as far as 10,000km, making it capable of reaching New York.It is the first of North Korea's intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). The Hwasong-15 missile is believed to have a range of 13,000km, putting all of the continental US in its sights.In October 2020, North Korea unveiled the latest of its ballistic missiles - the Hwasong-17. It is believed to have a range of 15,000km or more.It could possibly carry three or four warheads, rather than only one - making it harder for a nation to defend itself.The unveiling of the new missiles appeared to be a message to the Biden administration of the North's growing military prowess, say experts.In March 2021, it carried out a launch of what it called a "new-type tactical guided projectile", which it said was able to carry a payload of 2.5 tons - so capable of in theory of carrying a nuclear warhead. Analysts at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies told Reuters that it appeared to be "an improved variant" of a previously tested missile, the KN-23. The last time North Korea tested a nuclear bomb was in 2017. The explosion at its Punggye-ri test site had a force, or "yield", of between 100-370 kilotons. A 100 kiloton bomb is six times more powerful than the one the US dropped on Hiroshima in 1945.North Korea claimed this was its first thermonuclear device - the most powerful of all types of atomic weapon.However, North Korea may now be aiming to test a smaller type of nuclear warhead with similar explosive force, according to Mr Byrne. "It seems they are now testing a new capability - a miniaturised warhead that can be fitted onto a range of missiles, including short-range missiles" he says. Six underground tests have previously been carried out at Punggye-ri. However, in 2018 North Korea said it would shut the site down, because it had "verified" its nuclear capabilities.Some of the tunnels into the site were subsequently blown up in the presence of foreign journalists. However, North Korea did not invite international experts to verify if it had been put beyond use.Satellite images released earlier this year suggest work to renovate Punggye-ri had started.Any future nuclear testing at the site would breach resolutions from the United Nations Security Council.In 2018, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un made a promise to then-US president Donald Trump that North Korea would destroy all its nuclear material enrichment facilities.However, the UN's atomic agency says satellite images suggest that North Korea had restarted the reactor which makes its weapons-grade plutonium.The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has also said that North Korea's nuclear programme is going "full steam ahead," with work on plutonium separation, uranium enrichment and other activities.Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questions</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Nadine  Yousif"><Text>Former US President Donald Trump nearly fired his daughter and routinely flushed documents down the toilet.These explosive details and more are revealed in New York Times journalist Maggie Haberman's highly-anticipated book Confidence Man, which is released on Tuesday. The book follows Mr Trump from his time as a New York businessman to his life after the presidency. It draws from interviews with more than 200 sources, including former aides as well as three interviews with Mr Trump himself. The former president has attacked Haberman, writing on his social media platform that the book contains "many made up stories with zero fact checking".Here are eight of Confidence Man's biggest revelations:At a meeting with then Chief of Staff John Kelly and then White House counsel Don McGahn, Haberman writes that Mr Trump was close to tweeting that his daughter, Ivanka, and son-in-law Jared Kushner - both senior White House aides - were leaving their positions. He was stopped by Mr Kelly, who advised him to speak with Ivanka and Mr Kushner first before sending the tweet. Mr Trump never spoke with them, and they both remained White House aides until the end of his presidency. The book also reveals that Mr Trump frequently talked down on his son-in-law, and once commented that Mr Kushner "sounds like a child" after hearing a public speech he gave in 2017. Mr Trump has denied ever wanting to fire Ivanka and her husband. "Pure fiction. Never even crossed my mind," he said.Haberman writes that Mr Trump raised the prospect of bombing Mexican drug labs several times - a suggestion that stunned former US Defence Secretary Mark Esper. The idea stemmed from a conversation that Mr Trump had with Brett Giroir, a public health officer and an admiral with the US Public Health Service Commissioned Corps.Mr Giroir walked into the Oval Office wearing a dress uniform - as is customary for public health officers in the corps - and said to Mr Trump that facilities producing illegal drugs in Mexico should be handled by putting "a lead to target" to stop illicit substances from coming over the border.Mistaking Mr Giroir for a military officer, Mr Trump then suggested bombing the drug facilities. In response, the White House asked Mr Giroir to stop wearing his uniform. When Mr Trump fell ill with Covid-19 in October 2020, his condition at the White House was worsening and he was fearful of dying.  At one point, his deputy chief of staff, Tony Ornato, warned the president that if his health deteriorated further he would have to set in motion procedures to ensure the continuity of government. This fear existed despite several attempts by Mr Trump to minimize the pandemic, as he worried the virus was negatively impacting his image and political motivations. Haberman writes that he asked aides around him to take off their masks, and that he advised then New York governor Andrew Cuomo to not talk about the virus on TV. "Don't make such a big deal out of this," Mr Trump said to Mr Cuomo, according to the book. "You're going to make it a problem."Haberman's book details several encounters between Mr Trump and world leaders. For instance, in his first meeting with then UK Prime Minister Theresa May, Mr Trump spoke about abortion, saying "some people are pro-life, some people are pro-choice. Imagine if some animals with tattoos raped your daughter and she got pregnant?"He then changed the subject in a conversation on Northern Ireland to discuss how to block an offshore wind project from being set up near his property. When it became apparent that Mr Trump was losing the 2020 election to US President Joe Biden, he called former New York City mayor and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani."Okay, Rudy, you're in charge. Go wild, do anything you want. I don't care," Mr Trump said, after other lawyers refused to go as far as he has requested in his bid to overturn the election results. "My lawyers are terrible," he said to Mr Giuliani, according to the book. He also frequently berated White House counsel Pat Cipollone. The book reveals that at the time, Mr Trump was enamoured with conspiracy theories and sought out lawyers that his own advisers felt were deluded.On a plane while campaigning in 2016, Mr Trump was asked by his campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and his press secretary Hope Hicks to address his refusal to release his tax returns - an issue they saw as a problem for Mr Trump's White House bid.Haberman writes that Mr Trump responded by leaning back before snapping to a sudden thought: "Well, you know my taxes are under audit, I always get audited," he said. "So what I mean is, well I could just say, 'I'll release them when I'm no longer under audit. 'Cause I'll never not be under audit." Since Richard Nixon, every US president has voluntarily released their tax returns. A 2020 New York Times investigation has since revealed that Mr Trump paid $750 (£662) in federal income taxes the year he became president. When Mr Trump was in office, White House staff periodically discovered that the toilet was clogged with printed paper and believed he had flushed documents.He also allegedly tore up documents, which contravenes the Presidential Records Act - a law that says documents created or received by a president are the property of the US government and are to be handled by the US National Archives once the presidency ends.The details are revealed amid wider allegations of missing documents from Mr Trump's White House levelled by the National Archives. Mr Trump also faces a criminal investigation by the Department of Justice for keeping government records at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida after leaving office.At a congressional meeting shortly after his 2017 inauguration, Haberman writes that Mr Trump turned to a racially diverse group of Democratic staffers and asked them to fetch canapes, mistaking them for waiters.The book details that Mr Trump made the remarks to staffers for Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Nancy Pelosi. Haberman also documents a history of homophobic remarks allegedly uttered by Mr Trump. </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="BBC News, author unspecified"><Text>Four women have been selected to run the world's most remote post office and count penguins in Antarctica.Clare Ballantyne, Mairi Hilton, Natalie Corbett and Lucy Bruzzone beat a record number of applicants to become the team responsible for managing historic site Port Lockroy, on Goudier Island.The team will travel 9,000 miles from the UK to reopen the bay for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic.They will spend five months without running water or a flushing toilet.Newlywed Ms Corbett, in charge of running the gift shop at the site's museum, will leave behind her husband for the trip, which she dubbed a "solo honeymoon".The 31-year-old from Hampshire said she could not resist the opportunity to work on the island."Who wouldn't want to spend five months working on an island filled with penguins in one of the most remote places on the planet?" she said.As well as dealing with sub-zero temperatures and almost constant daylight, the women will share the island with a colony of gentoo penguins, which Ms Hilton will be in charge of monitoring."This will be my first time in Antarctica and I'm very excited to set eyes on the white continent. I have no idea what to expect when we get there - how cold it will be, will we have to dig our way through the snow to the post office?" Ms Hilton, from Bo'ness, near Falkirk in Scotland, said."I'm a conservation biologist, so personally I can't wait to see the penguins and other wildlife like seabirds and whales."The four women were among 6,000 people who expressed an interest in the roles, which were advertised by the UK Antarctic Heritage Trust (UKAHT) charity.Newly appointed postmaster Ms Ballantyne, from Lincolnshire, has just completed a masters in earth science at Oxford University.The 23-year-old will deal by hand with approximately 80,000 cards, which are mailed each year from the site to more than 100 countries.Ms Bruzzone will be base leader, managing the team and coordinating all ship visits to the island.The scientist, who has already spent three months in the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard on an Arctic expedition, described the opportunity as a "lifelong dream".The women will be joined for the first 10 weeks by 42-year-old Vicky Inglis, from Aberdeenshire, who was a UKAHT general assistant in the 2019/20 season.

It takes less than five minutes to get there, but the last 50 metres must be covered on foot through thick, spiky vegetation, some of it chest-high.  The two men flee as the unit approaches, leaving behind them the half-prepared boat, the fuel and motor, and two sacks of life-jackets."The vegetation works against us," General Frantz Tavart told me. "The smugglers know this and stash the boats here on purpose."The UK drones are valuable, he says, because they spot even well-hidden sites like this one."The drone caught this," he said. "The [surveillance] plane passed over beforehand and didn't spot it, because it was hidden by the trees."This 160km stretch of coastline has sucked in resources, year after year. France and the UK have invested in more patrols, better technology and different kinds of vehicles. And still the numbers crossing the Channel keep growing.Britain's new home secretary, Suella Braverman, will give a speech at the Conservative's party conference later where she's expected to restate her determination to crack down on the arrivals.French patrols say they're stopping around half of all crossing attempts, but more than 30,000 people have still made it to the UK so far this year.And it's not just migrants who are finding this route increasingly attractive. New smuggling networks have been reported this summer too.A senior French official with good knowledge of the situation told us that dedicated Albanian smuggling networks are now operating across the Channel, separately from the main Kurdish and Iraqi networks."[The Albanian networks] are more efficient than the others," he told us. "40% of those we intercept on this side of the Channel are Albanian; but they make up 60% of those who arrive on the other side.""Our hypothesis is that they're a lot more experienced than the others in terms of criminal activity, and more used to organising themselves and avoiding the police. We find the prices are higher for Albanian networks than for the others."General Tavart says he can't confirm whether the new Albanian smuggling routes are being run by established criminal groups, perhaps based in the UK, but he says it would make sense."With the price of a crossing around 4,000 euros (£3,482), and around 40 people in one boat, do the maths," he said.  "It's extremely lucrative, even more so than drug trafficking, and the criminal charges are lighter."Some have suggested that shortages in the labour market post-Brexit are adding to the 'pull-factors' attracting both smugglers and their clients.Larger numbers of Albanians have been seen at the main migrant camp in Dunkerque, but most seem to stay in hotels around the area, or in Paris or Brussels.At one hotel in Dunkerque, the landlady confirmed she now had a large number of Albanian clients passing through.  The owner of a bar across the street from the station said that on some days half his customers are Albanian."I wonder if there's anyone left in Albania," he said, "seeing how many of them are coming through here."The rise in migrants crossing the Channel, and the appearance of new smuggling networks, seems to challenge the government's strategy of deterrence.For months, the UK government has been promising to send some of those who arrive in small boats to Rwanda, where their asylum claims will be processed, and where they will be expected to settle if their claim is successful.On the road outside Calais, in the small hours of the morning, we met 17-year-old Sikunder and his friends, wrapped in survival blankets that glinted like pieces of silver in the dark.They are all from Afghanistan, they said, and had just been rescued from a sinking boat by the French police.I asked Sikunder whether he was aware that the UK might send him to Rwanda."I have heard about it," he replied, "but some of my relatives in the UK told us the plan was finished, and we can come to the UK."It was his second attempt at crossing; he's determined it won't be his last.The UK government is currently fighting a court battle over the legality of its Rwanda policy. In the camps around Calais, almost everyone is aware of the risk, and almost everyone finds a way to rationalise it away.Biniam is a softly-spoken 28-year-old man from the Tigray region in Ethiopia. In fluent English, he told me he had a Masters degree in manufacturing, and that he wanted to claim asylum in the UK because he had seen how the British government had spoken out strongly against the violent conflict in Tigray."The UK understands the situation in my country," he told me. "So that's why I will go."I ask him how afraid he is of being sent to Rwanda."100% afraid," he said. "If they return me to Africa, it will be easy for the government of Ethiopia to take me."More than one person here told me how the change of prime minister would mean the policy would be scrapped.There's little sign of that UK Prime Minister Liz Truss has so far been very supportive of it.Jess Sharman of Care4Calais says people are risking their lives to get to the UK, because they can't claim asylum while in France, and can't cross the Channel via official routes."They shouldn't be here, and it's only because of government policies that they are," she said. "And that could change overnight if Liz Truss could make it safe and legal for them to [claim asylum]."A lot can change overnight here in Calais.Camps are systematically destroyed by police units; violent conflicts erupt between smuggling gangs; security patrols race migrants for miles along the scrubby coastline; and - very often - as dawn breaks, another boatload of people from around the world end up on Britain's shores.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Rajini Vaidyanathan"><Text>The United Nations has issued a new appeal for more than $800m (£700m) for flood-hit Pakistan. The funds, a five-fold increase on the previous request, would help families and children battle malnutrition and infection in what is now a public health emergency. It comes as the country struggles to cope after more than 2,000 hospitals and health centres were damaged or destroyed in recent floods, which left almost 1,700 people dead. Doctors like Ammara Gohar are on the front lines of the crisis as the UN launches a fresh appeal for the world to send more aid."It's very difficult for us. We attended to patients during Covid, but this is tougher because it involves environmental hazards," says Dr Ammara, a gynaecologist four years into her medical career.  She is working out of a school in rural Sindh province, the area worst affected in the floods, which has temporarily become the headquarters for the district health office after it was submerged. Here, Dr Ammara and her team load a van with boxes of medical supplies - everything from bandages to malaria tablets, hepatitis test kits to oral rehydration salts."We're taking this to people who've been completely cut off since the floods," she explains. Pakistan flood survivors battle rising tide of diseasePakistan floods: Images show huge scale of devastationWith around 75% of districts in Sindh province still flooded - and many roads underwater -  the only way people in isolated communities can access medical help is if it travels to them.So after an hour's drive, we reach the banks of a huge lake which a few months ago was fertile land that fed people in this area. Having swallowed their crops, it's now stagnant water where mosquitoes multiply, and a breeding ground for disease.Across the vast expanse live villagers who've been stranded for weeks."These people cannot survive without support in disaster-hit areas," Dr Ammara tells us.Her team of government doctors take to wooden boats to reach them, their efforts supported by the United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef). "This is a medical crisis," Unicef's Aadarsh Laghari tells us, as the medical team headed to a village needing help. "Access is one of the biggest problems - every day the medical needs of these communities are rising."In the first three weeks of September alone, more than 140,000 cases of malaria were reported in Sindh, health officials say. But with many people in far-flung areas unable to get tested, it's likely the true scale is much higher.And that's why mobile medical units are so urgently needed.After we reach the shore, the team set up a health camp under the shade of a tree on the edge of the village, where cows had earlier been taking shelter from the sun.A banner is hung from the branches to advertise the clinic; supplies which had been carried here by land and by water, are now being unpacked and laid out on plastic tables.As a tannoy announces the arrival of the medical staff, a steady stream of villagers arrive, many of them women carrying young children. The village of Noor Shah was already impoverished but the floods have pushed people right to the edge.As patients line up, a nurse measures the arm of baby Saima, with Dr Ammara looking on. The tape wound around her tiny arm moves to the red area of the scale, indicating that Saima is perilously thin."There are so many people like this baby," Dr Ammara says. "At just nine months old she's severely malnourished."Many families are sleeping in the open in flimsy tents next to homes which were washed away, or have crumbled to rock.Marooned for weeks, they're finally getting much needed medical help - but many say they're still waiting to get food and access to clean water to drink and wash with.At another village close by, three-year-old Gulbahar is examined by Dr Ammara. He has scabs on his face and body and is weak -  the result, Dr Ammara says, of drinking and washing with contaminated water.The UN says a lack of toilets has left people with no choice but to defecate in the same water, leading to outbreaks of illnesses. "Because of the floods we are seeing so many young children with these skin infections," Dr Ammara says, opening Gulbahar's mouth to examine his diseased gums.She hands his mother some medicines, but concedes her supplies will soon run out.While diseases spike, Pakistan's already overwhelmed healthcare system lacks the resources to help all those who need treatment. Boats are also in short supply, as are doctors - meaning efforts like this remain limited.Many people we met in these remote communities blame the government for not doing enough. Dr Azra Afzal Pechuho, the Sindh health minister, said: "It's like fighting a war which has no end to it. Until the water recedes, which is going to take another two, three months, we will still be seeing a lot of health issues."She has called for doctors to volunteer extra hours. "Ten days, three days, four days - whatever they feel they can give to the flood-affected areas," she told the BBC.Dr Ammara and her team are already working around the clock.  Without the camps, Dr Ammara fears people won't be able to survive."It hurts, it really hurts, I can't see people like this," she says. "I feel bad that we can't do more."</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Nduka Orjinmo"><Text>Jane Toku sheds no tears as she recalls the moment when she saw the smouldering remains of her son's corpse on the morning he and three of his friends were lynched 10 years ago.The four students had run into a local vigilante group at dawn in Aluu, a community behind the University of Port Harcourt in southern Nigeria's oil capital.There had been a spate of robberies in the area and at that time of the morning, people became suspicions. Accused of being petty thieves, the four - Llody Toku, Ugonna Obuzor, Chiadika Biringa and Tekena Elkanah - were given a mock trial and found guilty.Their punishment was handed out immediately: they were stripped, marched around the community, brutally beaten and set alight by the mob as thousands watched and filmed."When I arrived, I forced my way through the crowd and knelt before my son's corpse."His friend Tekena was barely breathing, I watched his chest heave with his last breaths," Mrs Toku said.Such mob killings are not uncommon in Nigeria but this was the first to go viral on social media, causing widespread outrage, protests and debates about the country's judicial system, and questions about a society where people resort to such levels of violence."One is tired and sick of coming here to lament after these dastardly acts," a lawmaker said at the time when the incident was discussed at the National Assembly."It is important for 'jungle justice' to be stopped - it is bad," said radio host Yaw, as celebrities condemned the incident.But despite the shock and anger over the killing of the students, now known as the Aluu Four, and the sentencing of three men including one police officer, for their roles in the lynching, mob attacks continue to happen in Nigeria. There have been 391 mob killings in Nigeria since 2019, according to SBM Intelligence, a Lagos-based think-tank, with at least five this year alone. That begs the question why the outrage over the killing of the Aluu Four didn't lead to a national reckoning over lynchings."The failure of the criminal justice system is one very important reason for this," said Dr Agwanwo Destiny, a criminologist at the sociology department of the University of Port Harcourt.He pointed to instances where criminal suspects handed over to the police were released without investigation and ended up seeking revenge on those who had given them up."Such incidents erode trust in the judicial system, so when people are alleged to have committed a crime, people are quick to pass judgement and vent their frustrations," Dr Destiny said.It is an argument also made by activist Annkio Briggs, who led demonstrations in Port Harcourt to demand justice for the students and their families, because she "couldn't trust the system to do what was right," she told the BBC.Perpetrators of mob killings in Nigeria are rarely arrested and prosecuted.Two suspects arrested in May after the lynching of a Christian student on allegations of blasphemy in Sokoto have still not been brought to trial, while the police said the main culprits are still at large.It was one of four reported cases of mob killing in that month alone:Two men were burnt to death by a mob in the Ijesha area of Lagos over alleged theft of mobile phonesOne man was murdered in Lugbe, Abuja on allegations of blasphemyCommercial motorcyclists lynched a sound engineer identified as David Imoh in the Lekki area of Lagos.Suspects have been charged in all cases, the police said. But it might be years before there are any verdicts because of the slow pace of justice in Nigeria.Two years ago, Nigeria's anti-corruption agency, the ICPC, said the judiciary was the most corrupt arm of government in the country. It said that more than nine billion naira ($21m; £19m) was offered and paid as bribes in the sector. Such reports indicating that justice is for sale to the highest bidder erode trust in the system, said Dr Destiny.It has never been determined what the four students were doing when they were stopped by the vigilante group in Aluu.One version said they were thieves, another said they were members of a violent gang but neither allegation was proved in court."He was not a perfect child but he was humble and he was our confidant."He was close to us because we had our second child 11 years after him," Mrs Toku said of her son.The four students, best friends, were in their late teens and early 20s and came from middle-class homes.Ugonna, 18, and his friend Lloyd, 19 - known as Tipsy and Big L - were budding musicians in Port Harcourt's rap scene.One of their three unreleased songs Love In The City could almost be a prophesy of what befell them.Growing up in the city like PH where Ra was made to sing rightWe embrace the street life cosThere's no love in the heart of the cityHow can the seeds grow when the garden is wearyIt used to be very cool but the oil crude brought violence"There can be no justification, no reason why anybody should die like that," said their friend Gloria During, who lived in the same Hilton hostel in Aluu as both musicians.Aluu is popular for its private apartments that are rented by students who can't find accommodation at the university's insufficient hostels.At the time it was a small village with many undeveloped plots and a population that were mostly farmers. Today, Port Harcourt's sprawling metropolis has caught up with the fringes of Aluu - most of the land has been built on by Pentecostal churches and more hostels have sprung up.But in the centre of the community remains two barren plots, the playground where the students were first held and death pronounced on them, and the burrow-pit, several hundred yards away, where they were marched to, beaten and killed.Despite the nationwide shock when the incident happened, time has allowed most of Nigeria to move on.But for a mother, time is a keen reminder of the loss of a beloved first son with a bright future ahead of him. "He had a bright career in music, he would have gone far by now," Mrs Toku said. </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="BBC News, author unspecified"><Text>Celebrated Indian filmmaker Mani Ratnam's new film Ponniyin Selvan:1, a Tamil-language epic period drama, has taken the box office by storm. Sudha G Tilak on what makes the film a hit.Ponniyin Selvan, based on one of India's greatest emperors, is widely considered by many to be the finest novel ever written in Tamil.It was the name conferred by the loyal subjects on Rajaraja Chola - whose name means 'king of kings' -  of the Chola dynasty, which ruled Tamil land from 9th Century to 13th Century.Rajaraja was not the first of the Chola dynasty but he took their empire to its zenith - from a relatively small kingdom to the dominant empire in India. Their political influence extended across Sri Lanka, Maldives, Sumatra, parts of Thailand and Malaysia, and they had diplomatic ties with China.Rajaraja Chola: Cults of the ImaginationVenice film award for director Mani RatnamHistorian Sunil Khilnani wrote that Rajaraja "pulled off something that no Indian ruler before him seems to have done: he'd commandeered trading boats, timber sailed craft and launched maritime expeditions, bringing far flung wealth back home". The star-studded film, which cost $70m (£62m) to make, revolves around Ponniyin Selvan's ascendency to the throne as his father, the ailing king, retreats from royal duties. The kingdom is embroiled in palace intrigues and an impending coup. Rival members of the royal clan plot to usurp the throne, and enemy kings conspire assassinations. Leading the stratagem is a powerful and enigmatic noblewoman Nandini (played by Bollywood star Aishwarya Rai Bachchan) on a vengeful path to destroy her former lover and the prince-in-waiting (played by award-winning actor Vikram). Her rival is princess Kundavai (played by leading Tamil actress Trisha) who wants to defeat the plots, protect her brothers, and see that her rightful sibling ascends the throne. Row over Bollywood director in Indian Big BrotherActor Karthi plays the part of the colourful Vandiyathevan, a swashbuckling warrior and loyal friend of the princes. He is a musketeer-like figure, charming women, averting disasters, and thwarting plots with clever antics.  Ponniyin Selvan is a fictional literary record of the glory of the Cholas, whose cultural contribution remains visible in modern-day Tamil Nadu. The king's imprint can be seen in the stunning sculptures and inscriptions in a towering granite temple in the city of Thanjavur, which was the seat of the Cholas. The story of Ponniyin Selvan was serialised in Kalki, a Tamil magazine, by writer and journalist Kalki Krishnamurthy in 1955. The sprawling historical fiction, running to nearly 2,000 pages, has been published in several editions and translated into English. Comic books for children based on the novel and theatre productions have kept the epic alive in popular imagination."The novel has a cult following across generations of Tamils. It will be interesting to see how a 21st-Century audience reared on Game of Thrones and homegrown fantasy movies like Baahubali responds to this film based on 10th Century dynastic Tamil politics, royal intrigue, and chicanery," says Chennai-based film scholar Pritam Chakravarthy.Director Mani Ratnam, described as "India's top pop-film auteur", said in an interview that he wanted Ponniyin Selvan to be an "immersive experience" for the audience.Why Bollywood is struggling to beat pandemic bluesThe south Indian films winning on Bollywood's turfScenes of bloody battles and warring soldiers, horseback and elephant chases and dances with actors in regalia captivate audiences. A beachfront invasion, the king battling the savage seas and the sinking of a ship are a nod to the maritime escapades of the Cholas. The dialogue is in medieval Tamil, but written to be accessible to a contemporary audience.  The film's music, a blend of Western chords, folk drum beats, monkey chants and Sufi strains is led by Oscar-winning composer AR Rahman.Critics have appreciated Mani Ratnam for his deft adaptation of a five-part novel into two parts - the second part is due for release next year. Despite the pandemic, the director managed to wrap up filming both the parts of the movie, each running to nearly two-and-a-half hours, in 150 days.Ponniyin Selvan opened to a thunderous reception at the weekend. Cinema halls in the southern city of Chennai saw people queue up for special shows that opened after midnight to accommodate the huge volume of ticket sales. Scenes of fans dancing to folk drumbeats outside cinema halls celebrating the release of the movie were seen across Tamil Nadu.'Struggling' Bollywood's online hate problemThe frenzy over the film has spilled over with fans forming groups to travel across the former kingdoms and villages across Tamil Nadu ruled by the Cholas as mentioned in the novel. The first part ends with a cliff-hanger. And fans say they are waiting with a bated breath for the second part next year.Sudha G Tilak is an independent journalist and writer based in DelhiRow over Bollywood director in Indian Big BrotherThe problem of 'dirty money' in Indian politics Why India's abortion ruling is a huge step forwardAn Indian maharaja and a 'mystery' willNostalgia as cinema returns to Kashmir after 23 yearsMoonlighting debate divides Indian firms and workersWhy is India raiding this Islamic group?Unanswered questions in India sisters' hangingThe Indian state getting a bad rap over stray dogs</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Simon Fraser"><Text>An ex-policeman has killed at least 37 people, most of them children, in a gun and knife attack at a childcare centre in north-east Thailand.Police say he then killed himself and his family after a manhunt following the attack in Nong Bua Lamphu province.Children and adults are among the casualties at the nursery - police say the attacker shot and stabbed his victims before fleeing the scene. The former officer, aged 34, was sacked in June for drug use, police said.A teacher who survived told Thailand's Thairath TV that the attacker used to drop off his child at the nursery and had seemed polite. A motive remains unclear.At least 22 children were among the dead in the mass killing in the town of Utthai Sawan. Some victims aged as young as two were attacked as they slept. A dozen people who were injured have been taken to Nong Bua Lamphu district hospital.Follow our live coverage"The shooter came in around lunchtime and shot four or five officials at the childcare centre first," a local official, Jidapa Boonsom, who was working nearby, told Reuters news agency. One of them was a teacher who was eight months pregnant."At first people thought it was fireworks," she said, adding that the man then forced entry to a locked room where children were sleeping.'It's shocking' - witnesses describe nursery attack horrorVideos shared on social media appear to show the tears and distress of parents and relatives of those killed, as they gathered at a shelter outside the centre.Police officers arriving after the attack were confronted with horrific scenes, the bodies of adults and children, some of them very young, lying inside and outside the building. Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha described the incident as "a shocking event".Police named the attacker as Panya Kamrab, a local man who had been a police lieutenant colonel before he was dismissed last year for drug use. He is understood to have appeared in court on Thursday on charges related to the use and possible sale of methamphetamine. The verdict was scheduled to be delivered on Friday.Armed with a shotgun, a pistol and a knife, he stormed the nursery at about 12:30 local time (05:30 GMT). The details of what followed are still emerging, but after the killing spree the attacker fled the scene in a white four-door Toyota pick-up truck with Bangkok registration plates, according to police, who launched a search for him and warned locals to keep indoors for their own safety. Eyewitnesses were quoted saying the attacker had driven into bystanders and opened fire at some of them, injuring several people as he made his escape.The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterPolice say Kamrab returned home, killing his wife and son before taking his own life.Mass shootings in Thailand are rare, although gun ownership rates are relatively high for the region. Illegal weapons are also common in the south-east Asian country, according to the Reuters news agency. The nursery attack comes less than a month after an army officer shot dead two of his colleagues at a base in Bangkok.In 2020 a soldier killed 29 people and injured dozens more in the city of Nakhon Ratchasima.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Paul Adams in Zaporizhzhia and  Yaroslav Lukov in London"><Text>At least one person has been killed in a series of Russian rocket attacks on Ukraine's southern city of Zaporizhzhia, local officials say.They say the rockets hit residential buildings before dawn and then again several hours later.

Her uncle was also seen on TV speaking against the unrest, as someone seems to whisper to him: "Say it, you scumbag!"The source told BBC Persian that these were both "forced confessions" that came "after intense interrogations and being threatened that other family members would be killed".Atash and Nika's uncle, Mohsen, were detained by authorities after Atash posted messages online about her niece's death and spoke to the media. The televised statements were recorded before they were released, according to the source.The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterAtash told BBC Persian prior to her arrest on Sunday that the Revolutionary Guards had told her that Nika was in their custody for five days and then handed over to prison authorities.The judiciary has said that on the night she disappeared Nika went into a building where eight constructions workers were present, and that she was found dead in the yard outside the next morning.Tehran judiciary official Mohammad Shahriari was cited by state media as saying on Wednesday that a post-mortem showed Nika suffered "multiple fractures... in the pelvis, head, upper and lower limbs, arms and legs, which indicate that the person was thrown from a height".He declared that this proved her death was nothing to do with the protests. However, a death certificate issued by a cemetery in the capital, which was obtained by BBC Persian, states that she died after suffering "multiple injuries caused by blows with a hard object".Nika's Instagram and Telegram accounts were also deleted after she went missing, according to Atash. Iranian security forces are known to demand that detainees give them access to the social media accounts so that the accounts or certain posts can be deleted.Wednesday night's state TV report also featured footage in which Atash was seen confirming that her niece's body was found outside the building mentioned by the judiciary, even though that contradicted previous statements made by her and other members of the family.The family have said they located Nika's body at the mortuary of a detention centre 10 days after she went missing, and that they were only allowed by officials to see her face for a few seconds in order to identify her. Atash said before she was detained that she did not go to the mortuary.Nika's family transferred her body to her father's hometown of Khorramabad, in the west of the country, on Sunday - on what would have been her 17th birthday.A source close to them told BBC Persian that the family agreed, under duress from authorities, not to hold a public funeral. But, the source said, security forces then "stole" Nika's body from Khorramabad and secretly buried it in the village of Veysian, about 40km (25 miles) away.Hundreds of protesters later gathered in Khorramabad's cemetery and chanted slogans against the government, including "death to the dictator" - a reference to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei.Nika is not the only young female protester to have been killed during the unrest that erupted last month following the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman who was detained by the morality police for allegedly violating the Islamic Republic's strict hijab law.The family of Hadis Najafi, 22, have said that she was shot dead by security forces while protesting in the city of Karaj, west of Tehran, on 21 September. Officials allegedly asked her father to say that she died of a heart attack.Another 16-year-old girl, Sarina Esmailzadeh, died after being severely beaten on the head with batons by security forces during protests in Karaj on 23 September, Amnesty International cited a source as saying. The source also told the human rights group that security and intelligence agents had harassed the girl's family to coerce them into silence.  Several videos made by Sarina before her death have now been posted on social media. In one recorded after finishing some school exams, she says: "Nothing feels better than freedom."  </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Paul Kirby"><Text>At least 17 people have died and another 15 people are missing after a migrant boat sank off the Greek island of Lesbos on Wednesday night.The Greek coastguard said the dinghy had left the Turkish coast carrying 40 people in very high winds.Elsewhere in Greece dozens of migrants were rescued when their boat hit rocks near the southern island of Kythira.Coastguard video showed a group of people trapped beneath a cliff as rescuers pulled them to safety.Both boats went down within hours of each other on Wednesday night and early on Thursday, hundreds of kilometres apart.Volunteers joined rescue officials at the top of the cliff face on Kythira, an island off the Peloponnese region of southern Greece. The migrant boat broke up close to the island's eastern harbour at Diakofti in winds of up to 70km/h (45mph) and according to Greek reports one of those on board raised the alarm when it got into trouble."We could see the boat smashing against the rocks and people climbing up those rocks to try and save themselves," local resident Martha Stathaki told the Associated Press news agency. Eighty of the 95 people on board are said to have been rescued on the Kythira coast. Greek reports say they had originally come from Iran, Afghanistan and Iraq and included 55 men and 18 children.Mayor Stratos Harhalakis said the boat had arrived at the worst possible point on Kythira as a gale-force winds pushed  it on to treacherous rocks. He described seeing five people drown as they were swept away. Their small boat was big enough for 15 to 20 people, rather than almost 100, he said. Meanwhile, on Lesbos, authorities said the bodies of 16 young women of African origin and a young boy had been recovered after their boat went down near Thermi. Ten women were rescued and taken to the local hospital at Mytilini. Lesbos was also hit by powerful winds as the coastguard searched for survivors.Local officials said the boat had left the Turkish port of Ayvali and Greek Migration Minister Notis Mitarachi called on Turkey to take "immediate action" to put an end to irregular migrant crossings in harsh weather. "Already today many lives lost in the Aegean, people are drowning in unseaworthy vessels. EU must act," he tweeted.While Lesbos is a short distance from the coast of western Turkey, Kythira lies some 400km (250km) west of Turkey's coastline on the Aegean Sea and is on what has become known as the smugglers' "Calabrian" route, named after their destination in southern Italy.Last month two migrant boats landed on Kythira carrying almost 100 people, mainly from Afghanistan. More and more crossings are being made from Turkey to the Italian coast, bypassing Greece.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Helen Bushby and Ian Youngs"><Text>French writer Annie Ernaux has won the Nobel Prize in Literature, for what the panel said was an "uncompromising" 50-year body of work exploring "a life marked by great disparities regarding gender, language and class".The prestigious accolade is awarded by the Swedish Academy and is worth 10 million Swedish kronor (£807,000).She said it was "a great honour".Professor Carl-Henrik Heldin, chair of the committee, said the 82-year-old's work was "admirable and enduring".He said she used "courage and clinical acuity" to tell semi-autobiographical stories that uncover "the contradictions of social experience [and] describe shame, humiliation, jealousy or the inability to see who you are".The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterHer books, including A Man's Place and A Woman's Story, are considered to be contemporary classics in France.Ernaux is the first French woman to win the literature prize, and told Swedish broadcaster SVT it was "a responsibility"."I was very surprised... I never thought it would be on my landscape as a writer," she said. "It is a great responsibility... to testify, not necessarily in terms of my writing, but to testify with accuracy and justice in relation to the world."Jacques Testard, from Fitzcarraldo Editions which publishes English translations of her work, told BBC World Service Radio's Newshour she is an "exceptional and unique" writer. "She's a very important feminist writer, I would say, also a very important working class writer - both of those themes I think very clearly visible in her work," he explained. Dr Ruth Cruickshank, who specialises in contemporary French fiction at Royal Holloway, University of London, said: "When a woman wins the Nobel Prize for Literature it is always great news. Thirteen dead and two living white French men have been Nobel laureates since 1901."She explores memories of life experiences - both extraordinary and relatable - a backstreet abortion; failed affairs whether with a lover in Russia or a man 30 years younger; the death of her parents; breast cancer."Ernaux was born in 1940 in Normandy, where the setting for her early life was "poor but ambitious", Prof Heldin said.Her parents ran a café and grocery shop, and when she encountered girls from middle-class backgrounds, she experienced the "shame of her working-class parents and milieu for the first time," according to her website.That would later feed into her novels. Her official biography said the main themes of her work were "the body and sexuality; intimate relationships; social inequality and the experience of changing class through education; time and memory; and the overarching question of how to write these life experiences".Ernaux studied literature, having worked as an au pair in London, and was married with two children and teaching in a French secondary school when her first book was published in 1974.Cleaned Out was a fictionalised account of the illegal abortion she had in 1964, which she kept secret from her family.She revisited that trauma 25 years later for the book Happening, in which she "sifts through her memories and her journal entries dating from those days". It was turned into a film that won the top prize at last year's Venice Film Festival.Prof Heldin added: "Annie Ernaux manifestly believes in the liberating force of writing. Her work is uncompromising and written in plain language, scraped clean."The writer got divorced in the early 1980s, and in 2000 she retired from teaching to devote herself to writing.Another of Ernaux's books, The Years, won the Prix Renaudot in France in 2008 and the Premio Strega in Italy in 2016, while a year later she won the Marguerite Yourcenar Prize for her life's work.In 2019, The Years went on to be shortlisted for the Man Booker International Prize, whose judges called it a "genre-bending masterpiece".Booker said at the time that "autobiography is given a new form, at once subjective and impersonal, private and collective".The New Yorker wrote in 2020 that over her 20 books, "she has been devoted to a single task: the excavation of her own life".The Nobel Prizes, awarded since 1901, recognise achievement in literature, science, peace and latterly economics. Last year's literary prize was won by Tanzanian novelist Abdulrazak Gurnah.Other winners have included novelists such as Ernest Hemingway, Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Toni Morrison, plus poets such as Louise Gluck, Pablo Neruda, Joseph Brodsky and Rabindranath Tagore, and playwrights including Harold Pinter and Eugene O'Neill.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Jessica Parker"><Text>The leaders of more than 40 European countries are having talks in Prague, at a historic first meeting of a new political forum of nations.As he arrived, France's Emmanuel Macron spoke of building a "common strategy" in response to Russia's war in Ukraine.UK Prime Minister Liz Truss joined leaders from the EU, Turkey, Norway and the Balkans, as Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky spoke via video link.Germany's chancellor said the gathering was a great innovation.The summit, billed as a European Political Community beyond the EU, has been championed by Emmanuel Macron, who told reporters on Thursday it sent a "message of unity". But there is scepticism, even within the EU, about the new forum. Ahead of the meeting, Ms Truss made clear it was "not an EU construct or an EU alternative". Nevertheless, her decision to take part could mark a new phase in the UK's post-Brexit relations with Europe. The leaders were discussing energy, migration and security, with a particular focus on the war in Ukraine. Officials said Ms Truss spoke of the need for stronger, more resilient economies and energy supplies, while stressing the need for freedom to succeed.Ukraine's president told the summit: "You and I are now in a strong position to direct all the possible might of Europe to end the war and guarantee long-term peace for Ukraine, for Europe, for the world."EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said in a blog that in the wake of Russia's invasion, there was a need to "rethink and reform the wider European order, beyond the work of the EU and Nato", but he added that the summit would be no more than an initial exchange.As well as the UK, non-EU members Switzerland, Turkey, Norway, Iceland, Georgia, Azerbaijan and western Balkan countries are among those taking part in the first gathering of the EPC.Germany's Olaf Scholz pointed out that all the countries attending the summit knew that Russia's war was "a brutal violation of the security and peace order that we have had in Europe over recent decades".Critics see it as a vague regurgitation of old ideas and its exact role has yet to be made clear. When he proposed the idea this year, President Macron said it would "offer a platform for political co-ordination" for countries, both those in the EU and those not. Russia's invasion of Ukraine gave new impetus for co-operation among nations beyond the EU's 27 member states. What is the new European Political Community?Truss pledges billions to support Ukraine in 2023But the new EPC has no institutions or dedicated staff. That has led to questions about how any decisions would be implemented. So it's an unprecedented effort to bring leaders together from across the continent to discuss areas of shared interest. If it proves to be a success, it may continue to take place up to twice a year. If it's a failure, it could fizzle out.Ms Truss had been hostile to the EPC project, so what changed?Some observers point out it was never likely she would voice passionate enthusiasm for a French-led European meet-up while vying for the Tory leadership.But once in power, she appeared to warm to the idea, although Downing Street is reluctant to accept suggestions that Mr Macron won her over.It might prove to be a "modest" turning point in EU-UK relations, says the director of the Centre for European Reform, Charles Grant.While a row about post-Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland remains unresolved, talks are restarting this week."Neither side is trying to push that issue to the brink at the moment," says Mr Grant. "So this summit could be a sign of a modest rapprochement."The official line was that the PM was taking part because she wanted to "shore up" support for Ukraine and "galvanise" collective action on energy security and migration.Downing Street said Ms Truss would call on leaders to keep oil and gas interconnectors open this winter while taking part in talks on joint projects to develop new nuclear and offshore wind capacity.Another draw for the UK was the presence of Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan, as well as the participation of Norway, a key supplier of energy to the UK.The UK has been less keen to talk about security, with jitters that the EPC could be seen as somehow cutting across the Nato military alliance.If the EPC does prove short on solid outcomes, then expect it to be long on messages about support for Ukraine and condemnation of the Kremlin.But not all those attending are of one mind on the conflict."One of the measures of success will be, does it persuade Serbia, Azerbaijan and Turkey to lean a bit more to the West and less towards Russia?" says Mr Grant.Turkey has talked of a "balanced" approach to Russia and has not signed up to Western sanctions."When first proposed by Macron, the EPC was supposed to be a club with shared democratic values, but it's now more about making sure Europe as a whole isn't Russia's friend," says Mr Grant.A sign of the uncertainty about what the EPC is really for is that there have been far clearer messages about what it is not.It's not a substitute for Nato or the G7, we're told. It's not a slightly comfier "waiting room" for countries eager to join the EU. Nor it is a forum that will be dominated by EU institutions.That's despite invites having been issued by the president of the European Council, Charles Michel, while the meeting itself has been tacked on to the front of an EU summit.Brussels insists it has merely been facilitating the forum - it's not "the EU plus plus", insisted one senior official.The next EPC, in either six months or a year's time, is likely to be held in Moldova.If the project survives, the UK is currently fourth in line to host a summit. But British officials are keen to play it cool on the EPC, insisting they will walk away if it evolves in an undesirable direction.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="BBC News, author unspecified"><Text>Oscar-winning actor Kevin Spacey has gone on trial in New York over an allegation he sexually assaulted a boy 36 years ago.Mr Spacey is facing a civil lawsuit brought by Anthony Rapp, who says the actor inappropriately touched him at a party in 1986 when he was aged 14.Mr Spacey, 63, is separately facing five charges of sexual assault in the UK.The House of Cards actor has denied the allegations against him. Both Mr Rapp, now 51 and also an actor, and Mr Spacey were in the Manhattan federal courthouse when the trial opened with jury selection on Thursday.Mr Rapp says that Mr Spacey was around 26 or 27 years old when he met him at a party at his Manhattan apartment. In a Buzzfeed article from October 2017, Mr Rapp said that Mr Spacey had picked him up, placed him on a bed and lay down partially on top of him."I was aware that he was trying to get with me sexually," Mr Rapp said.His lawsuit says the alleged encounter lasted no more than two minutes and "there was no kissing, no undressing, no reaching under clothes, and no sexualized statements or innuendo".The legal action was filed in September 2020 and accuses Mr Spacey - whose real name is Kevin Spacey Fowler - of battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress.Mr Rapp is reportedly seeking $40m (£35m) in damages.The judge assigned to the case, Lewis A Kaplan, previously dismissed a charge of sexual assault, ruling the statute of limitations had expired. One day after the Buzzfeed article was posted five years ago, Mr Spacey took to social media to say he had no memory of what Mr Rapp described. "If I did behave then as he describes, I owe him the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior," he wrote."And I am sorry for the feelings he describes having carried with him all these years."In a video deposition he filmed with lawyers in January, Mr Spacey denied that the incident ever took place, according to news website Law &amp; Crime.  Mr Rapp's account "couldn't have been true", he said, because "I am not interested in boys and I do not touch people inappropriately".Mr Rapp stars in Star Trek: Discovery on Paramount+ and was previously in the Broadway musical Rent. Separate sex assault charges - alleging that Mr Spacey groped an 18-year-old at a restaurant in Nantucket, Massachusetts, in 2016 - collapsed in 2019 after the actor's lawyers argued the accuser had manipulated text messages on his phone.In August, a judge ruled that Spacey must pay $31m to the producers of House of Cards for the costs they incurred after firing him from the show. In July, he entered a not guilty plea in London to criminal charges of sexually assaulting three men over a decade ago. That trial is due to begin in June 2023.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="BBC News, author unspecified"><Text>A global alert has been issued over four cough syrups after the World Health Organization (WHO) warned they could be linked to the deaths of 66 children in The Gambia.

The four products had been identified in The Gambia, but "may have been distributed, through informal markets, to other countries or regions", the WHO added, in the alert published on its website.It warned that their use may result in serious injury or death, especially among children.The WHO's intervention came after medical authorities in The Gambia - a popular tourist destination - detected an increase in cases of acute kidney injury among children under the age of five in late July.The Gambia's government has since suspended the use of all paracetamol syrups and has urged people to use tablets instead.The number of deaths has declined since the ban but two more have been recorded in the past two weeks, Gambia health services director Mustapha Bittay told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme.He said that The Gambia did not currently have a laboratory capable of testing whether medicines were safe and so they had to be sent abroad for checking. Mr Bittay added that The Gambia was in discussions with the World Bank to get funding for a quality-control laboratory.The WHO said that laboratory analysis of samples of the products "confirms that they contain unacceptable amounts of diethylene glycol and ethylene glycol as contaminants".The substances were toxic, and their effects "can include abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhoea, inability to pass urine, headache, altered mental state and acute kidney injury which may lead to death," it added. Mr Bittay also said that traces had also been found of E.Coli, a bacteria which can cause diarrhoea and vomiting.The Gambia's health officials said last month that dozens of children had died, without giving an exact number.Speaking in Geneva on Wednesday, WHO chief Tedros Ghebreyesus said: "The loss of these young lives is beyond heart-breaking for their families." The WHO said that India's Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation indicated that the manufacturer may have only supplied the contaminated medications to The Gambia, AFP news agency reports, quoting an email from the UN health agency.But the WHO said that "global exposure" was possible as the "manufacturer may have used the same contaminated material in other products and distributed them locally or exported" them, the agency reports. </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Alex Therrien"><Text>A top chess player accused of cheating has insisted he is "not going to back down" after making his first comments on the scandal in nearly a month.On Tuesday, a Chess.com investigation claimed it was "likely" Hans Niemann cheated in more than 100 games online.The 19-year-old American rising star had already been accused of cheating by world champion Magnus Carlsen.Speaking on Wednesday after winning his US Championship game, Niemann said his victory was "a message to everyone". In a news conference following a convincing win against 15-year-old grandmaster Christopher Yoo, Niemann was asked about the "elephant in the room" - a reference to the cheating scandal that has gripped the chess world.Without addressing the allegations directly, Niemann said: "This game is a message to everyone. This entire thing started with me saying 'chess speaks for itself' and I think this game spoke for itself and showed the chess player I am. "It also showed I'm not going to back down and I'm going to play my best chess here regardless of the pressure."Niemann then cut the interview short after less than 60 seconds.The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on Twitter"You can leave it to your own interpretation, but thank you, that's it", he said when the interviewer tried to ask more questions."That's all I can say, because it was such a beautiful game I don't even need to describe it," he concluded.  Niemann, who was playing in the first round of the US Championship in St Louis, then walked out of the interview, prompting commentator Yasser Seirawan to laugh and say: "What? That's it? Ok." Until the interview Niemann had not spoken about the scandal since 7 September when he admitted to cheating in informal games when he was younger but strenuously denied doing so in competitive games.Niemann added that he was willing to play naked to prove his innocence and accused Carlsen and Chess.com of trying to ruin his career. The cheating row that's blowing up the chess worldWorld's top chess player accuses opponent of cheatingChess player 'likely cheated' in 100 games - reportThe scandal began last month after 31-year-old Carlsen, considered by many to be the greatest player of all time, was defeated by Niemann at the Sinquefield Cup in a major upset. The Norwegian made veiled accusations of cheating against Niemann at the time before openly accusing him last week. Then on Tuesday, a Chess.com investigation claimed it was likely Niemann had cheated "much more often" than he had admitted to, including in prize money events and against highly-rated "well known" figures in the game. Chess.com also noted "anomalies" in Niemann's rate of improvement, which has seen him soar up the rankings in classical chess from around 800 in the world to the top 50 in less than two years.The site said this rise was the fastest in "modern recorded history" and had occurred "much later in life than his peers".But it found no evidence he had cheated in his game against Carlsen or in any other over-the-board games.A separate statistical analysis of Niemann's over-the-board games by Prof Kenneth Regan, widely regarded as the world's leading expert on cheating in chess, has also found no evidence he cheated.Not since 2006's "Toiletgate" has chess faced a cheating scandal at the elite levels of the game. Back then, world championship challenger Veselin Topalov's team accused the champion Vladimir Kramnik of cheating during his "strange, if not suspicious" trips to the bathroom. Prof Regan also found no evidence Kramnik had cheated.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Nathan Williams"><Text>Gunmen have shot dead the mayor of a small town in western Mexico, and at least 17 others, officials say.Police say gunmen stormed the San Miguel Totolapan town hall at 14:00 (19:00 GMT) on Wednesday. Photos online show it riddled with bullet holes.Mayor Conrado Mendoza Almeda's left-wing PRD party condemned his "cowardly" assassination and demanded justice.The attack has been blamed on the Los Tequileros criminal gang, which is linked to a powerful drug cartel.Police officers and council workers were also killed in the massacre, with graphic images of bloodied bodies lying on the ground circulating on social media. Mr Mendoza Almeda's father, former mayor Juan Mendoza Acosta, was also killed - in his home - before the attack moved to the town hall.A highway in the state of Guerrero, where San Miguel Totolapan lies, was reportedly briefly blocked by large vehicles to prevent security forces from getting into the city.Even by the violent standards of Guerrero state, this was a shocking attack, reports the BBC's Mexico correspondent, Will Grant.San Miguel Totolapan lies in the heart of a region known as Tierra Caliente, a violent part of drug cartel-controlled western Mexico. Various groups battle for control of the lucrative drug routes north along the Pacific corridor, our correspondent adds. The region is a hotspot for the growing of opium poppies and the production of heroin.In a preliminary report seen by local media, Guerrero's attorney general said that as well as the 18 people who were killed, three others were wounded.It is not yet clear what the motive behind the attack may have been but killings of local officials are not uncommon.In 2018, at least three dozen mayors, former mayors and mayoral candidates were killed. The number has dwindled to single figures in recent years but those who hold local office remain at risk from armed gangs, which often want to be the only authority in town.Following the attack, the defence ministry said it was deploying army and navy units to the area to find the gunmen.  Guerrero Governor Evelyn Salgado Pineda tweeted to say she deeply regretted the deaths.Shortly before the attack, alleged members of Los Tequileros released a video on social networks announcing its return to the region, where they had been fighting a rival drug gang.The criminal group devastated Guerrero between 2015 and 2017 - and was known for threatening mayors of the region - until its leader Raybel Jacobo de Almonte was assassinated.De Almonte was known as El Tequilero - the Tequila Drinker - and his gang took their name from him.Additional reporting by Tiffany Wertheimer</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Tessa Wong"><Text>I'm stuck at home taking care of a sick child, when a familiar feeling suddenly hits - a craving for durian.But there's no need to head out to a durian stall or supermarket to buy the tropical fruit, lug it home, and wrestle open its spiky husk.I just whip out my phone, open an app called Grab, and make a few taps.Forty-five minutes later, there's a knock on my door. A deliveryman hands over a bag: it's my durian, freshly shucked and sealed in plastic tubs, ready to eat.From ordering cabs and food, to paying our bills and booking holidays, super-apps like Grab offer a mindboggling array of services. They don't exist yet in the West - Elon Musk is thinking of creating one called X - but in many parts of Asia they've already been a vital part of our everyday lives for the past few years. I mostly use Grab to get a ride home after a night out, or order Thai takeaway when I haven't got the energy to cook dinner for the family.But many in Singapore also use it to send parcels and documents, or shop online - one colleague just purchased a home karaoke set.     Other extensions allow you to book bus and ferry tickets, make hotel reservations, and even arrange for someone to come to your home and do a professional Covid swab test.These can be paid for through the app's finance system. There's an e-wallet linked to your bank account or credit card, or you can set up instalment plans, or pay with points which you earn with every activity done through the app. It can also be used for cashless payments - you pay for items at a shop by scanning a QR code with the app, or you can get a physical card linked to your account.But Grab is not the only player in town.There are super-apps aplenty from Indonesia's GoJek to India's PayTM and they allow you to do even more, such as book a manicure, order fuel for your motorbike, pay your traffic fine and purchase gold. They have caught on in a region of digital natives - in South East Asia alone, about three-quarters of our population use the internet, and of that group, 88% own a smartphone.Elon Musk, Twitter and the mysterious X app Then, there's China's WeChat - the original Asian super-app said to be the inspiration for Mr Musk's X.It's a messaging and social media platform that's evolved into one of the region's biggest apps in terms of its range of services and number of users. At last count it's estimated to have 1.29 billion users in China alone. WeChat is also one of China's biggest payment networks, with consumers using it to pay for goods and services and to send money to each other. Some research suggests that a Chinese user spends as much as a third of their waking life on WeChat alone.Much has been written about how its ubiquity in Chinese everyday life, operating in a society tightly controlled by the government has seen WeChat become a tool of surveillance and censorship.Messages, posts and even accounts are routinely blocked for content deemed politically sensitive, and there are concerns of how it could contribute to the various controversial "social credit" schemes in China, where citizens' lives can be restricted based on their bank credit scores or social behaviour. In 2020, WeChat introduced its own scoring system where users get extra privileges if they have good in-app credit records.The example of WeChat highlights the main concern about super-apps - with everyone doing practically everything on just a few platforms, these apps end up collecting a vast trove of data on people, and could wield some power over our daily lives.WeChat and the Surveillance StateHow such data is treated and to what extent governments should have access to it will be part of the debate in societies where privacy is particularly prized. Mr Musk's X super-app - if it does come to fruition - may be seen by some with suspicion as a double-edged Swiss Army knife.For others though, the convenience and simplicity of living life on one app is an easy trade-off to make. There's always the option of scaling back their use, for those with deep concerns about privacy.And in open markets, specialty apps will continue to vie for users' attention, reducing the likelihood of most of the data ending up in the hands of just one or two companies - one reason for WeChat's dominance in China is because some apps like Twitter and WhatsApp are blocked there.Here in Singapore, I don't do everything on Grab. It's not because I distrust it, but I prefer using specialty apps to do other things like grocery shopping and buying clothes as they're just better at it.So I'm fine with Grab humming away in the recesses of my phone because it doesn't know everything about me, just some things - like the fact that I love delivery durian.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Ashley Lime &amp; Carolyne Kiambo"><Text>A school dormitory in western Kenya burned down a few weeks ago and several students were arrested on suspicion of arson - just the latest instance of a devastating criminal pattern that has dominated the country's education system for more than 30 years. Last year saw a particular spike in the number of boarding school arson attacks by the pupils, which students blamed on an intensified curriculum following time lost to the Covid lockdown. The second half of the year saw an average of three a week. The BBC has spoken to students whose schools have been set on fire to investigate what lies behind the regular attacks.The names of the students have been changedIt was about 16:30 on a Sunday afternoon when someone on the school field spotted the fire. At first, Lillian wasn't too worried. It was just the matron burning rubbish, someone said. But before long, screaming students began streaming out of the school building. Smoke was pouring out of Lillian's dorm. Lillian [not her real name], 15 at the time of the attack last October, was terrified. She knew her good friend was in the building having a nap."People were crying, they were traumatised… [I could see] smoke had covered the entire dorm."They watched as students at Buruburu Girls High School - in the capital Nairobi - began jumping from the windows to escape. Lillian doesn't know for sure what provoked the arson attack. But she claims that students were deeply unhappy about the amount of academic pressure they were under in the run up to national exams."We're usually in class by 4.30am every morning," Lillian told the BBC last November. Independent study then continued to 22:00, she said. Boarding schools are the main educators of secondary school-aged children in Kenya - seen as a way of getting good quality subsidised education, and places where children can concentrate on their studies.Another student, Mary, 16, confirmed that there had been no extra curricular activities last year, and said the academic schedule had been intense."We had to add more lessons to cover the syllabus in time… it was quite challenging." The terrors of Kenya’s school fire epidemic Her mother confirmed that her daughter had complained of long hours and poor student-teacher relations. The BBC asked Buruburu Girls High School to comment but it did not respond. Kenya's boarding schools are educationally demanding, admits Dr Newton Mwangi, a former principal of Passenga Secondary School who retired last year."Nowadays a child who does not make a good score to take him or her to university is like a condemned child," he says.Arson attacks are not a new issue in Kenyan boarding schools - the deadliest Kenyan school arson took place 20 years ago, killing 67 students in Machakos County, south-east of Nairobi.The fires are particularly dangerous because they are usually lit in dormitories, as was the case in Lillian's school. Although her friend finally emerged through the fire exit unscathed, 59 of the girls were reported by local media to have received hospital treatment for smoke inhalation, minor burns, and fractures.  Such attacks have historically been debated only behind closed doors - the government refuses to share data with the media on the number of school arson attacks, or discuss the issue. But in November 2021, the Ministry of Education issued a response to a parliamentary committee which had requested more information on the school arson crisis and revealed that there were 126 arson cases between January and November last year. It revealed that 302 students had been arrested in connection with those incidents and of those, 41 had appeared in court accused of arson and destruction of property.We don't know how many of those 41 were found guilty, because Kenyan courts restrict reporting on crimes involving children, children's lawyer Paul Muchiri told the BBC. One of the few convictions we are aware of took place earlier this year. An 18-year-old was found guilty of manslaughter for starting a fire that resulted in the death of 10 students at Moi Girls High School in Nairobi in 2017 when she was 14. The student, only identified as TWG, was handed a five-year prison term. The Ministry of Education statement issued in November listed what it believed to be the reasons behind the arson epidemic, which included: overcrowding, poor teacher-student relations, drug abuse, and inadequate counselling services within schools. It suggested however that the fault did not just lie with academic institutions, remarking that parents were "overprotective" of their children when accused of misbehaviour, and that the law hindered teachers' ability to discipline pupils. Its recommendations included recruiting professional school counsellors - but it also suggested "critically" examining the role of boarding schools in Kenya's education system. Lillian not only missed nine days of school as a result of the destruction, but all students' families were asked to pay collective damages, a common policy according to local media reports. Lillian's mother shared a letter from the school with the BBC dated 5 November - five days after the fire - requesting 1,500 Kenyan shillings [£10] "for damages incurred". The family lives in a slum and she says this was a huge amount of money for the family to find.The Ministry of Education did not respond to the BBC's request for an interview. School arson is not unique to Kenya, says Elizabeth Cooper, a Canadian academic and anthropologist who has spent years in Kenya studying the issue.But she says what is remarkable is its frequency, severity and collective nature. "Many students participate, sometimes planning in advance, sometimes being coerced to participate by other students… [which] points to… this idea that there could be some consensus around the logic of using arson," she told the BBC.Dr Cooper believes this might be because students feel as though setting fire to their schools is working to an extent, and that it might be time to consider a different approach to education in Kenya, which currently relies on "trying to strong-arm [students] into compliance". The potential to shift thinking on this might lie with teacher training colleges, she says, but parents, governors and politicians would all need to be brought on board, meaning it will take time "to try shifting the culture of how education is done".</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Jonathan Beale"><Text>The war in Ukraine has underlined the growing importance of space to armies on the ground. In an interview with the BBC, the head of the US Space Force, General Jay Raymond, describes it as the "first war where commercial space capabilities have really played a significant role". It's also the first  major conflict in which both sides have become so reliant on space.Gen Raymond - whose service is the newest branch of the US armed forces - avoids giving precise details of how the US and its allies have been helping Ukraine. But he gives a clear indication of what it's been doing. "We use space to help strike with precision, we use space to provide warnings of missiles, of any threat that could come to the United States or to our allies or partners," he says. There are already more than 5,000 satellites in space - most are operated for commercial purposes. But among them are hundreds of dedicated military satellites - the US, Russia and China having the largest number. Ukraine has none. But it has received significant help from the West in a number of ways. The first is providing intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance - or ISR. Ukraine has had access to unprecedented amounts of commercial satellite imagery. At a recent conference, the director of the US National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency said it had more than doubled the commercial imagery available over Ukraine in the run-up to the war.  Air Vice-Marshal Paul Godfrey, who heads the UK's Space Command, says that along with commercial and civilian ISR provided to Ukraine "there's an awful lot of nations with military capabilities in space - they're looking at Ukraine as well".Space ISR helped identify the initial build-up of Russian forces before the invasion on 24 February and the movement of troops and military hardware ever since. Satellites have been used to track Russian warships in the Black Sea, including the cruiser Moskva which was sunk by Ukraine.  Early warning radar - like the giant one at RAF Fylingdales in North Yorkshire - have also been able to track the launch of ballistic missiles.Air Vice-Marshal Godfrey says ISR satellites have also been essential for "telling the truth" about the war. He gives the example of the massacre in Bucha, near Ukraine's capital Kyiv. He says Russian claims that the bodies of dead civilians were already on the streets when they arrived were contradicted by time-stamped satellite imagery showing otherwise. Media organisations, including the BBC, have also had unprecedented access to commercial satellite imagery - which can be used to corroborate claims on the ground. That includes identifying mass graves or Ukraine's recent attack on a Russian airbase in Crimea, a southern Ukrainian peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014. Early warning radar have also been able to track the launch of ballistic missiles. The US is also now in detailed  discussions about installing more giant radar in the UK to keep an eye on what's happening in space.And recently Ukrainian volunteers have fundraised enough money to buy an entire satellite to help the country's military in detecting Russian targets.The Sar (Synthetic Aperture Radar) satellite of the Finnish company ICEYE has proved to be extremely effective - in just the first two days of its usage the Russian military damages exceeded $16m - more that the cost of the satellite purchase, Ukrainian officials say.Space has also been crucial to communications throughout the war. At the start of the war Russia conducted a series of military strikes and cyber-attacks to take out Ukraine's key communication nodes. Air Vice-Marshal Godfrey credits Elon Musk with "essentially getting the internet back up and running in Ukraine" - helped by an appeal on Twitter by the Ukrainian Minister of Digital Transformation, Mykhailo Fedorov.The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterElon Musk has sent thousands of Starlink internet kits to Ukraine giving access to SpaceX's constellation of satellites in orbit. They've been essential to providing Ukraine's military with secure communications and situational awareness throughout the war. I've seen them being used from Ukrainian command bunkers in the country's eastern Donbas region.  Both Russia, and more recently Ukraine, have been relying on space-based positioning, navigation and timing (PNT) to conduct precision strikes on key targets, with Russia's cruise missiles using its own Glonass positioning satellites to find their targets. For Ukraine, the addition of US-supplied precision weapons to its arsenal have been key to its recent advances. Himars rockets - which have a range of up to 50 miles (80km) and are guided by GPS - have been used to destroy key targets, such as ammunition dumps and command centres well behind the frontline. More recently, the US has supplied Ukraine with GPS  guided Excalibur artillery shells - more accurate than so-called dumb ammunition. Precision has made a difference. The increasing reliance on space raises concerns that conflict could spread beyond land, sea and air. Russia and China have both conducted tests to destroy their own satellites, and Admiral Tony Radakin, the UK's Chief of the Defence Staff, has recently warned that Russia could carry out attacks on Western targets in space.  Gen Raymond says "there's a full spectrum of threats we're concerned about". He lists GPS and communications jamming, direct energy weapons like lasers, or missiles fired from the ground which could be used to target satellites. He says the US and its allies want to make sure that there's always safe and responsible behaviour in space - but adds "what worries me is not everybody shares that view". In reality, the militarisation of space is well under way.

But it's a move with other Scandinavian precedents.In 2019, Sweden's monarch, King Carl XVI Gustaf, removed royal status from five of his grandchildren.It was again with a nod towards the public mood of not wanting too many royals getting taxpayers' funding.Danish Queen 'sorry' over stripping of royal titlesSwedish King removes grandchildren's royal statusHow is the Royal Family in Britain funded?It might also be seen as an inevitable consequence of the hereditary and dynastic principle of monarchy. Family trees are often going to get bigger, with widening branches of children, grandchildren and relations.So, like clipping back a royal garden, every so often there will have to be a careful pruning of those defined as having royal status.This reduced-scale approach in Denmark might be in tune with public opinion, with more than three-quarters supporting the monarchy.This is also a country where the level of public funding for the royal family - currently about £11m per year for the queen, her residences and staff - is linked to the pay index of Denmark's state-sector employees.But could this be an example for the British Royal Family, with King Charles III long associated with calls for a "slimmed-down" monarchy?This has never been very specifically defined, but has been interpreted as a plan to focus more tightly on a smaller group of royals - sending a message of purposeful frugality.It's like the wedding photograph with just the main participants rather than the group shot of whoever was there at the time.This slimming down might have already happened by default, with Prince Andrew, Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex no longer carrying out royal duties or receiving public funding. Buckingham Palace now uses the concept of "working royals" for a smaller group who carry out the round of visits, ceremonies and constitutional duties, distinguishing them from a wider range of royal relatives.The working royals include the King, Queen Consort, Prince William and Catherine, the Princess of Wales; Princess Anne; Prince Edward and Sophie, Countess of Wessex; Princess Alexandra and the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester.Last year there were 2,300 official engagements carried out. Princess Anne on her own carried out almost 400.At the Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations earlier this year, the distinction between working and non-working royals was visibly played out on the symbolic platform of the Buckingham Palace balcony.Prince Harry and Meghan, and Prince Andrew were not on the balcony to wave to the crowds. There were 18 royals on view - presenting much less of a crowd scene, when on occasions in the past there have been more than 40 people on the balcony.The reign of the new King has only just begun, but there are likely to be questions about how he might want to re-shape the monarchy and how the royal households will be run.Close to the issue of the size of the monarchy will be its cost to the public.The public funding of the Royal Family in Britain comes via the Sovereign Grant, which is based on a proportion of the profits from the independently-run Crown Estates.This pays for the running costs of the monarchy and its working royals - such as staff, travel, overseas visits, the upkeep of buildings, with £86m received last year, with extra costs from renovating Buckingham Palace pushing up overall spending to £102m.The Prince of Wales also has an income from the Duchy of Cornwall and the monarch has a private income from the Duchy of Lancaster.Although slimming down the number of cash-hungry royal buildings, rather than the number of people, could be the biggest financial question. Repairs and refurbishments to Buckingham Palace alone cost £54m last year, more than half the total of expenditure.However, the new King can look to the future with a sense of rising popularity, according to YouGov polling last month, which showed 70% now having a positive view of him, up from 54% earlier in the year and before he took to the throne.But there are big underlying generational differences in attitudes towards the monarchy, according to YouGov. While about two-thirds across all ages back the monarchy, it's below half for 18-24 year olds.Monarchies have always had to adapt to survive. As Queen Margrethe said about her own slimming-down plans, she had to "ensure that the monarchy always shapes itself in keeping with the times".</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Nadine Yousif"><Text>For humans, staying warm in the winter often means swapping out flimsy tank-tops for thick parkas. For Alaskan bears, it means eating a jaw-dropping 500lb (225 kg) of fresh salmon. These bulking creatures are the focal point of Fat Bear Week - a highly anticipated online bracket that pits the portly mammals at Alaska's Katmai National Park against one another, with voters crowning the fattest of them all.  The competition is stiff this year: Otis, a large adult bear with the record for most Fat Bear Week wins at four, is back to defend his title. He once ate 42 salmon in one sitting, and his fishing skills and patience are hard to beat. But Bear 747, winner of Fat Bear Week 2020, might give Otis a run for his money. He is one of the largest bears on earth, weighing as much as 1,400lb (635kg). Most bears know they can't compete with him. The winner of Fat Bear Week 2022 remains to be seen. Voting is open until 11 October - Fat Bear Tuesday - when the champion will be crowned. Until then, people can watch their favourite bears via livestream and follow their journey as they pile on their gains for the winter and feast at Alaska's Brooks River, located in Katmai National Park's sprawling eight million acre reserve.  Organisers of the "extremely popular" Fat Bear extravaganza say viewers tune in from almost every country in the world, and have taken quite a liking to the charismatic creatures. "It's fairly rare to get to know wild animals on an individual level," said Mike Fitz, founder of the inaugural Fat Bear Week in 2014 and the resident naturalist with explore.org, which operates the bear livestreams. Each bear has a unique story, Mr Fitz said, and some have developed quite the fan base. For example, Otis has a loyal following who enjoy his poise and calm in stressful hunting conditions. "[Otis] goes to his spot, he sits there, he waits for his meals to come to him, and it is a very successful strategy," Mr Fitz said. "He's the most patient bear that I have ever seen."Others marvel at the steadfastness of mother bears who are devoted to keeping their cubs safe and fed before they are forced to seek shelter from the cold. Fat Bear Week also teaches onlookers how North American brown bears prepare for the winter - by getting fat to survive. Bears emerge from their hibernation in the summer months weary and thin. They then spend their time hunting enormous amounts of fish. By October, they've put on so much weight that some are almost unrecognisable. In November, the bears start heading towards their dens where they will hibernate for six months. In that time, they don't eat, drink water, or pass urine or faeces."They're surviving at that time just on their body fat," Mr Fitz said, adding that they remain healthy throughout.Like its ursine* stars - [*definition: 'of, or to do with bears'] - Fat Bear Week seems to have hit its peak. Mr Fitz said votes on the first day, 5 October, had already surpassed last year's. As for who his favourite hefty hibernator is, Mr Fitz said he has officially endorsed Bear 747. "I think he is the fattest bear so he deserves the vote, but other people are welcome to disagree - and they often do," he said.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Andrew Harding"><Text>Young children are dying in growing numbers in Somalia amid the worst drought to hit the country in 40 years. Government officials say that an even greater catastrophe could sweep the country within days or weeks unless more help arrives.The tears tumbled down 11-year-old Dahir's hunger-hollowed cheeks. "I just want to survive this," he said quietly. Seated beside the family's makeshift tent, on the dusty plain outside the city of Baidoa, his weary mother, Fatuma Omar, told him not to cry."Your tears will not bring your brother back. Everything will be fine," she said. Fatuma's second son, 10-year-old Salat, died of starvation two weeks ago, shortly after the family reached Baidoa from their village, three days' walk away. His body is buried in the rocky earth a few metres from their new home - the grave already covered in litter and increasingly hard to spot as new arrivals set up camp around them. "I cannot grieve for my son. There is no time. I need to find work and food to keep the others alive," Fatuma said, cradling her youngest daughter, nine-month-old Bille, and turning to look at six-year-old Mariam as she gave a rasping cough.On the other side of the dirt road that loops to the south-east, towards the coast and Somalia's capital, Mogadishu, other displaced families told more grim stories of long treks across a drought-parched landscape in search of food.  A new survey has shown that almost two-thirds of young children and pregnant women in the camps are suffering from acute malnutrition, which, along with a high death rate, could indicate that a localised declaration of famine is already overdue."I saw my daughter [three-year-old Farhir] die before me and I could do nothing," said Fatuma, who had walked for at least 15 days with her nine children from a village called Buulo Ciir to reach Baidoa."I had been carrying her for 10 days. We had to leave her by the side of the road. We had no strength to bury her. We could hear the hyenas closing in," she continued. "I've brought nothing with me. There is nothing left at home. The cattle are dead. The fields are dry," said Habiba Mohamud, 50, clutching a piece of twine in one hand, and acknowledging that she will never return to her village.A succession of droughts, turbo-charged by climate change, is now threatening to end a pastoral way of life that has endured for centuries across the Horn of Africa.Like other new arrivals, Habiba was busy erecting a tent for her family from branches, twigs, and scavenged scraps of cardboard and plastic sheeting, hoping to finish it before the chill of night. Only after that could she turn to finding food and medical help for some of her five children.On the admissions ward in the city's main hospital, Dr Abdullahi Yussuf moved between beds, checking on his tiny, emaciated patients. Most were children between two months and three years old. All were severely malnourished. Some had pneumonia and many were battling a new outbreak of measles too. Few infants had the strength to cry. Several had badly damaged skin, broken by the swelling that sometimes accompanies the most extreme cases of hunger. "So many die before they even reach a hospital," said Dr Abdullahi, watching his team struggling to connect an intravenous tube to the arm of a moaning two-year-old.Although Somali officials and international organisations have been sounding the alarm for months about an impending famine in this south-western region, Dr Abdullahi said his hospital was already short of basic items including nutritional supplements for children."Sometimes we lack supplies. It's terrifying, actually, because people are dying, and we can't support them. Our local government is not handling this well. It has not been planning for the drought or for the arrival of displaced families," he said, with visible frustration.A local government minister conceded there had been failings."We need to be faster than we are, and we need to be accurate… and more effective," said Nasir Arush, Minister for Humanitarian Affairs for South West state, on a short visit to one of the camps around Baidoa. But more international support, he insisted, was key."If we don't receive the aid we need, hundreds of thousands of people will die. The things we're doing now we needed to do three months ago. In reality we are behind. Unless something happens [fast] I think something catastrophic will happen in this area," he said.The process of formally declaring a famine can be a complicated one, reliant on hard-to-pin-down data, and, often, political considerations. Britain's ambassador in Mogadishu, Kate Foster, described it as "essentially, a technical process". She pointed out that during the 2011 drought "half of the 260,000 deaths happened before famine was declared".The presidential envoy leading Somalia's international effort to secure more funding thanked the US government, in particular, for recent new funding, saying it "has given us hope".But Abdirahman Abdishakur warned that without more help, a localised crisis in one part of Somalia could quickly spin out of control."We were raising the alarm… but the response of the international community was not adequate," Mr Abdishakur said."Famine is projected. It happens [already] in some places, some pockets, in Somalia, but still we can prevent the catastrophic one," he continued, speaking by phone during a stopover in Toronto, Canada.Although estimates vary, the population of Baidoa has roughly quadrupled in the past few months, to around 800,000 people. And any visitor will quickly notice one striking fact: almost all the new adult arrivals are women.Somalia is at war. The conflict has endured, in different guises, since the central government collapsed three decades ago, and it continues to affect almost every part of the country, tearing men away from their families to fight for an array of armed groups.Like most of those arriving in Baidoa, Hadija Abukar recently escaped from territory controlled by militant Islamist group al-Shabab."Even now I'm getting calls on my phone from the rest of my family. There is fighting there - between the government and al-Shabab. My relatives have run away and are hiding in the forest," she said, seated beside her sickly child at a small hospital in Baidoa.Other women spoke of husbands and older sons being blocked from leaving areas controlled by the militants, and of years of extortion by the group. Baidoa itself is not quite surrounded by al-Shabab, but it remains a precarious place of refuge. International aid organisations, and foreign journalists, require heavy security to move around, and any travel beyond the city limits is considered extremely risky."We're looking at populations that are under siege. Sometimes it feels quite hopeless," said Charles Nzuki, who heads the UN children's fund, Unicef, in central and southern Somalia.According to some estimates, more than half the population affected by the current drought remains in areas controlled by al-Shabab. Strict US government rules blocking any assistance from benefitting designated terrorist groups have complicated efforts to reach many desperate communities. But international organisations, and the Somali authorities, are working with smaller local partners to increase access and are now planning air drops into some contested territories. Still, one aid worker, speaking off the record, acknowledged that it was almost impossible to guarantee that no food or funds were reaching al-Shabab."Let's not be naïve, [al-Shabab] taxes everything, even cash donations," they said. Over the years, the militant group has established a reputation not just for violence and intimidation but for delivering justice in a country with a hard-earned reputation for official corruption. In at least four villages close to Baidoa, al-Shabab runs a network of Sharia courts that are routinely used by the city's residents and, reportedly, by people in Mogadishu and beyond, to settle business and land disputes. Further to the north-east, a sudden uprising against al-Shabab has seen local communities and clan militias - now heavily backed by the central government - drive the group out of dozens of towns and villages in recent weeks. The military successes have prompted a surge of optimism, but it is not clear if that will help in the fight against famine, or simply distract the Somali government."It might, or it might not [help]. I think it may create more [civilian] displacement. Or the government might liberate more areas and people might have more access [to aid]. So, we're looking at it from all sides," said local minister Nasir Arush.In Baidoa itself - a busy city of narrow, cobbled streets scarred by decades of conflict and neglect - the prices of basic goods, like rice, have doubled in the past month. Many residents blamed the drought, but others also looked further afield."Flour, sugar, oil - they've all risen by about the same amount. Sometimes we have to skip meals. I heard about the war between Russia and Ukraine. People say that is the root cause of these problems," said Shukri Moalim Ali, 38, walking over to her dry well, and barren vegetable patch.While the fight to ward off a deeper, spreading famine is the immediate focus in this region, Somalia's new government is also looking ahead, seeking to address more existential questions about the future."It is a challenging task, to respond to the drought, to fight against al-Shabab, and to campaign to access [international] climate justice finance," Abdirahman Abdishakur said."We have a young population, an enormous diaspora, and vibrant entrepreneurial skills. So that gives us hope. It's challenging, but we don't have an alternative."</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Katty Kay"><Text>The upcoming midterm elections for US Congress, the first nationwide vote since Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol nearly two years ago, have many Americans on edge. The BBC's Katty Kay has been finding out why.Karen and Steve don't want to take up arms. But if Republicans lose in November this elderly Arizona couple say a civil war is coming and, yes, they will fight. They have discussed it between them, and feel that taking up arms is their best option. It was at this point that our conversation grew a little dark and my faith in the strength of American democracy grew a little shaky. I met the Slatons at their Trump paraphernalia store in Show Low, Arizona. It was one of the first stops on a month-long road trip that I took around America this summer, a journey to understand why the upcoming elections feel so consequential, perhaps even a little ominous.The couple were delightful hosts. They were funny and generous. They took me on a tour of their extensive stock of whacky Trump merchandise and explained that, yes, there really are people who want a $100 life-size cut-out of the former president dressed as Rambo to put in their living rooms. Quite a lot of people actually. Trump as Rambo is one of their best selling items. We talked about history, the economy and even abortion. But it was only when I questioned their belief that the 2020 election was stolen that things got tense. Wasn't it possible, I asked, that millions of Americans just didn't like President Trump and so Joe Biden won the election? It was Karen who responded, with a distinctly steely glint: "If you're a crazy liberal, we're just not interested. The central news, let me call them, I'm not going to call them fake news, but it is fake news to say that America doesn't like Trump. America loves Trump."The BBC is not fake news, but I let that pass. The idea of war, however, demanded clarification. "It will start on a small scale, it will be like town against a town, state against a state," Steve had clearly thought this through. People have been tossing this idea of a second American civil war around for a couple of years now, ever since the 2020 election, ever since the violence of the Capitol Riots on 6 January, 2021. I find it hard to believe - maybe I lack imagination - but the idea of Americans going to war over a lost election still seems implausible. But that's Steve's take on what happened last time: "When Lincoln won, that triggered the South." That's not the only view of the origins of the American Civil War, but this wasn't the moment for a history debate; it's the present that needs attention. As I said goodbye to the Slatons, Steve threw out a warning. It was said with a habitual American friendly smile, but it was chilling nonetheless: "This could turn really nasty." Just how nasty was what I was trying to find out. You can watch Katty's hour-long film in the UK on iPlayer.In the US and Canada, it is available on BBC Select.And it will be broadcast on BBC World News on 8 and 9 October. Click on the links for details.Americans cast their ballots for control of Congress every two years. The congressional elections that fall in years when they aren't voting for president are called midterms. Because the White House isn't up for grabs, midterms generally don't get much attention and turnout hovers around 40%, lower than the 50-60% that vote in presidential elections. But this year feels different. This is the first national election since the storming of the Capitol and will test whether America can hold an election without violence. And, to be clear, the war talk from Americans like the Slatons is not normal pre-election rhetoric. In two and a half decades in America I've covered 10 US election cycles, I have never heard voters talk about politics in this violent way.Karen and Steve's views are not fringe views either. The belief that the 2020 election was stolen has seeped into the mainstream like a virus that now infects the entire democratic process. Polls since the election suggest that about 70% of Republicans believe Joe Biden is not the legitimate president. That's about one third of the American electorate, or more than 50 million people - not far off the population of Britain. This summer on a tour of Arizona, Wyoming, Georgia and Pennsylvania, I spoke to dozens of voters who are convinced Joe Biden is not America's legitimate president. If you felt an election had been stolen from you, you'd be angry too. Indeed, maybe you'd feel it was something worth fighting for. The problem is there is no evidence to support the stolen election claim. More than 60 lawsuits were brought by Trump's lawyers claiming election fraud. All but one was dismissed for lack of evidence. Some of the suits were even heard by Trump appointed judges, and they, too, tossed the cases out. Key Republican election officials in battleground states, like Arizona, and Georgia, also said the election process had been fair and accurate. There is no evidence of fraud that would have overturned Joe Biden's win. That hasn't stopped the fraud conspiracy virus from spreading. Trump may have launched it, but it has now spread across the country and taken on a life of its own. It is different from policy issues like gun rights or taxes. People have strong beliefs about those things too - Steve and Karen Slaton certainly did. But disagreements on those issues have facts that both sides can debate. The "election was stolen" is not a debatable issue. There are no facts on that side of the argument. In that way it's more like an unshakable belief system, and from my interviews I'm not sure the faithful would change their minds even if Trump himself were to suddenly say Biden won fair and square. The impact of this conspiracy on the US voting system was made clear to me in Georgia, in the election offices of Paulding County, where public officials are gearing up for the midterms with some trepidation. Deirdre Holden is an unelected civil servant with the job of Supervisor of Elections and Voter Registration. She is in charge of the mechanics of voting, making sure polling stations operate smoothly, ballots are collected safely and counted accurately. Holden doesn't tear up easily, but when she rereads the threat letter she received after the 2020 election she chokes, for just a second. "This election is effing rigged," it reads. (Deirdre is exceptionally polite, she has that wonderful Southern gentility, and she wants to spare me the profanities.) "Detonations will occur at every polling site in this county. No one at these places will be spared. If you think we're bluffing, eff-ing try. You've been warned. We will end you all." Deirdre puts down the letter and wipes her eye. If I got that message, I'd be afraid to come into work, but what I'm seeing isn't fear, it's anger. "I never was scared. I was mad. Mad that someone tries to threaten us, to threaten the people that just want to cast their vote. That didn't sit very well with me," Deirdre says. When her office in Paulding County (which by the way voted for Trump, though that really shouldn't matter) received that threat after the 2020 election, they passed it onto the FBI. Agents told her she ought to start parking her car outside her office window; it would help limit the force impact of an explosion, they explained. Deirdre wasn't the only election official to be targeted after that vote. The select committee investigating the Capitol Riot interviewed several witnesses who had been threatened, along with their families. After Al Schmidt, Philadelphia's elected Republican city commissioner, defended the election's integrity and confirmed Biden's win, he got one text that read, "You lied. You [are] a traitor. Perhaps 75 cuts and 20 bullets will arrive soon." The Brennan Center for Public Justice examined the aftermath of the 2020 election and concluded that threats against both elected and unelected election officials reached unprecedented levels. According to their findings, one in three election officials said they felt unsafe doing the job. Little surprise that large numbers quit after 2020. The question is why so much mistrust and anger now? Americans have been polarised for decades and this is not the first conspiracy theory to take hold here. But we haven't seen a storming of the US Capitol before, nor so many threats to election officials, nor so much attention paid to trying to change the election rules. How will new voting laws affect the election?Tracking Trump's 'extraordinary' endorsement spreeJoe Biden says Trump ideology threatens US democracyThe answer, most political observers suggest, is a confluence of events that allowed the election denying conspiracy to spread, thereby weakening the whole system. First, Trump started saying the vote would be rigged against him, long before the election even happened. He undermined trust before a single ballot was cast. Then, election rules changed in 2020 to accommodate Covid restrictions. Election deniers say those changes, which included more early voting and more postal votes, left the system open to widespread fraud (though there's no evidence of that.) The Brennan report also points to the impact of social media. "In 2020, political actors ramped up the lies about election processes, often on social media" the report found. "This disinformation has indelibly changed the lives and careers of election officials." Almost 80% of election officials, according to the report, say the rise of misinformation has made their jobs more difficult. Over a half say it has made them more dangerous. "People just have lost their trust. And that's what breaks my heart," says election official Deirdre Holden. And like the Slatons, she leaves me with a warning - November's midterms are going to be worse. Deirdre is non-partisan. I spent a few hours with her and I can honestly say I have no idea how she votes. That's exactly as it should be. The running of democratic elections should be in the hands of officials who have no bias. The people who organise the voting, count the ballots and certify the results should not inject their own politics into the process. When they do, trust is lost. And in this respect, the dispute over 2020 has shown the American system to be uniquely vulnerable. The US is the only Western democracy where the senior election officials are not civil servants. At the state level, it is the post of secretary of state that runs the election. And that person is elected, as a Democrat or a Republican. This November there are some 200 Republicans on the ballot who say they believe the 2020 election was stolen. In at least seven states there are election deniers on the ballot who could have a direct impact on voting systems. In a close election in 2024, those people could be key in deciding who wins the White House.One of those critical posts is a state's secretary of state. In the past it was a post that got very little attention in election campaigns. It was almost an afterthought and certainly not a position that would get national or even international press attention. So the fact that I found myself flying over the desert in a private plane interviewing Arizona's candidate for secretary of state this summer, is a telling indication of how this midterm election is different. In a world where election results are contested, the secretary of state suddenly becomes very important. They have the ability to change the way people are allowed to vote and even change the rules around the count. Trump fully understands the significance of this post - on 2 January 2021 he famously called Georgia's Secretary of State, Brad Raffensperger, and urged the Republican to "find" him an extra 11,780 votes so that Trump could win the state. Raffensperger denied Trump's request. Now the former president wants to make sure that he has allies in the job of secretary of state, so that if he runs in 2024, he can count on them to help him out. In the run-up to the midterm elections, money and attention, from both parties, is pouring into the secretary of state races in half a dozen battleground states. Which is why I spent the day, and a terrifyingly bumpy plane ride, with Mark Finchem. And also why he had a private jet at his disposal in the first place. Joe Biden won Arizona by a mere 10,000 votes. Finchem is a staunch election denier who believes Trump was robbed in the state and would like to overturn the 2020 result. If he's elected this November, he plans to ban voting by mail (the preferred choice of 80% of Arizona's electorate), ban early voting, and do away with electronic voting machines - all by 2024, the next presidential contest. He says he just wants to eliminate any chance for fraud.Inflation might get her to vote Trump againMeet the BBC's 'undercover voters'His critics say Finchem is a threat to democracy who wants to control the voting process in a way that could swing the vote in Republicans' favour. One Republican state representative has even broken with Finchem and is backing his Democratic opponent in the race. Finchem has a mix of charm and vehemence that is disarming. He told me he doesn't believe Democrats could ever win Arizona, not in 2020, not in 2022 and not in 2024. He is running against Democrat Adrian Fontes and appears well positioned to win the race. In September, a poll by OH Predictive Insights showed Finchem leading Fontes 40%-35%. So, a man who says the last election was rigged and who also doesn't believe Republicans can lose the state could well end up in charge of running elections. It's not hard to see where this could go. If Finchem, and other candidates like him around the country, change the voting system in ways that make it almost impossible for their side to lose, then, come 2024, Democrats, with some reason, won't trust the results either. They will say they were robbed of victory. It won't be many voting cycles before no one trusts election results here. As I travelled thousands of miles across the country it was clear both sides believe America's democracy is in peril, for very different reasons. Each side blames the other.There's no obvious solution to this spiral of mistrust. Across the nation I heard anger, anxiety, even talk of violence. We are watching these midterms so closely, in part because of the attack of January 6th and in part because they will help set the stage for whether Donald Trump runs again. 2024 is just around the corner. It is likely to be a tumultuous couple of years. </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Alexandra Fouché in London &amp; Hugo Bachega in Kyiv"><Text>A large fire on the only crossing between the occupied Crimean peninsula and Russia was caused by a lorry explosion, Russian officials say.A blast on the road section led to oil tankers on the rail section catching fire, before the road collapsed.Crimea was annexed in 2014 by Russia, which now uses the bridge to move military equipment into Ukraine. The official Twitter account of the Ukraine government responded to the fire by tweeting: "Sick burn."An adviser to Ukraine's President Zelensky, Mykhailo Podolyak, did not directly claim Ukrainian responsibility, but wrote: "Crimea, the bridge, the beginning."Everything illegal must be destroyed, everything stolen must be returned to Ukraine, everything occupied by Russia must be expelled."Meanwhile, the Ukraine defence ministry compared the bridge explosion to the sinking of Russia's Moskva missile cruiser in April."Two notorious symbols of Russian power in Ukrainian Crimea have gone down," it tweeted. "What's next in line?"The Russian foreign ministry said "the Kiev regime's reaction towards destruction of civilian infrastructure is a testament to its terrorist nature".LIVE UPDATES: Blast causes only Crimea-Russia bridge to collapseExcitement and fear in Ukraine after bridge blastIt is hard to exaggerate the significance, and symbolism, of seeing the bridge on fire. Opened by President Putin in 2018, it was meant to symbolise that Crimea was Russian.Russia has used the bridge to move military equipment, ammunition, and personnel from Russia to battlefields in southern Ukraine. As such, Ukrainian authorities said it was a legitimate target, as they vow to retake the peninsula.Any attack on Crimea, where the Russian army has a massive presence, will be seen as another massive humiliation for the Kremlin.     The bridge is particularly hated by Ukrainians. Social media in Ukraine erupted in celebration on seeing the fire - one day after Russian President Vladimir Putin turned 70. Road and rail traffic across the bridge has been suspended. Local authorities in Crimea say they will organise a ferry service between the Russian mainland and the peninsula.Russia's National Anti-Terrorism Committee said: "At 06:07 Moscow time today [03:07 GMT], an explosion was set off at a cargo vehicle on the motorway part of the Crimean bridge on the side of the Taman peninsula, which set fire to seven fuel tanks of a train that was en route to the Crimean peninsula. "Two motorway sections of the bridge partially collapsed."Crimean parliamentary speaker Vladimir Konstantinov blamed the explosion on "Ukrainian vandals, who have finally managed to reach their bloody hands to the Crimean bridge".He added the damage to the bridge would be "promptly restored, since it is not of a serious nature".President Putin has been briefed about the "emergency" on the bridge and has ordered a government inquiry, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, in comments quoted by Interfax news agency.A criminal investigation is also under way.The 19km (12-mile) bridge across the Kerch Strait, which cost £2.7bn to build, was opened by President Putin four years after Moscow illegally annexed Crimea. It is the longest bridge in Europe, and was hailed by Russian media as "the construction of the century". Russian officials previously claimed it was well protected from threats from air, land or water.The crossing is more than 100 miles from Ukrainian-held territory. One explosives expert told the BBC the fire was probably not caused by a missile."The lack of obvious blast / fragmentation damage on the road surface suggests that an air-delivered weapon was not used," he said.He said it was possible that "a well-planned attack from below may have been the cause"."I suspect explosives on the road bridge and train deck were initiated near simultaneously using coded radio command," he added.Ukraine claimed responsibility last month for a series of air strikes on Crimea over the summer, including an attack on Russia's Saky military base.Kyiv has the momentum in this conflict. The army has reclaimed large swathes of territory, forcing Russian troops to abandon long-held positions. Amid the losses, Moscow has begun a chaotic military mobilisation - which led to rare anti-war protests in Russia, and a huge exodus of military-age men.On Russian TV talk shows, presenters and studio guests have been expressing increasing doom and gloom about the situation. </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Hugo Bachega and John Simpson"><Text>Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky says Russian officials have begun to "prepare their society" for the possible use of nuclear weapons, but added he does not believe Russia is ready to use them. In an interview with the BBC, President Zelensky denied having urged strikes on Russia, claiming that an earlier remark had been mistranslated. "You must use preventive kicks," he said, referring to sanctions, "not attacks".In recent weeks, the Ukrainian army has recaptured large swathes of territory in a successful counter-offensive that has forced Russian troops to abandon long-held positions. In what Kyiv describes as Moscow's response to its defeats, President Vladimir Putin has incorporated four partially occupied regions of Ukraine.The annexations, widely dismissed as illegal, have raised fears of a possible escalation in the seven-month war. President Putin and other senior Russian officials have suggested that nuclear weapons - possibly smaller, tactical weapons - could be used to defend those areas, although Western officials say there has been no evidence Moscow is prepared to do so.Speaking in English at the president's office in Kyiv, President Zelensky said: "They begin to prepare their society. That's very dangerous. "They are not ready to do it, to use it. But they begin to communicate. They don't know whether they'll use or not use it. I think it's dangerous to even speak about it."Then, in Ukrainian, he said through a translator: "What we see is that Russia's people in power like life and thus I think the risk of using nuclear weapons is not that definite as some experts say, because they understand that there is no turning back after using it, not only the history of their country, but themselves as personalities." However, he denied having called for strikes on Russia during an online event on Thursday, saying the Ukrainian word he had used had been misunderstood. The initial comment was denounced by Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as "an appeal to start yet another world war", while Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said it demonstrated why Russia was right to launch its operation in Ukraine."After that translation," President Zelensky said, "they [the Russians] did their way, how it's useful for them, and began to retranslate it in other directions."The interview happened hours after US President Joe Biden said that the Russian threat to use nuclear weapons had brought the world closer to "Armageddon" than at any time since the Cuban Missile Crisis during the Cold War.President Zelensky said action was needed now, as Russia's threats were a "risk for the whole planet". Moscow, he claimed, had "made a step already" by occupying the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe's largest nuclear station which President Putin is trying to turn into Russian property.   Around 500 Russian troops were at the plant, he said, although the Ukrainian staff still operate it."The world can stop urgently the actions of Russian occupiers," President Zelensky said. "The world can implement the sanction package in such cases and do everything to make them leave the nuclear power plant."Empowered by sophisticated Western-supplied weapons, the Ukrainian army has made significant advances in the east and the south, reclaiming towns and villages even in areas the Kremlin claims are now part of Russia. President Zelensky said Russian forces were putting up a "good enough fight", but that Ukraine had received weapons - "I won't say we have enough now" - and soldiers were motivated to push forward.The Russian military's setbacks, a major embarrassment for President Putin, have sparked unusual criticism of the country's military.Amid the losses, President Putin announced the mobilisation of hundreds of thousands of reservists, which led to rare anti-war protests in Russia and to a huge exodus of military-age men.President Zelensky urged Russians to "fight for your body, rights and soul", saying: "Those mobilised kids now, they come with nothing. Without guns or armour. They are being thrown here like cannon fodder... If they want to be kebabs - fine, let them come. But if they are people after all and think that this is their lives, they have to fight. "Everything Putin is afraid of, and it's not the nuclear hit, he is afraid of his community," he said. He's afraid of his people. Because only those people are capable of replacing him nowadays. Take away his power. Give it to someone else."Asked whether President Putin could survive in an eventual Ukrainian win in the war, he said: "I don't care."</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Paul Adams"><Text>Ukraine is exploding with excitement this morning.Videos of the damaged Crimean bridge have spread like wildfire on social media; this is already being compared to the sinking of the Russian warship Moskva in April."The guided missile cruiser Moskva and the Kerch bridge - two notorious symbols of Russian power in Ukrainian Crimea - have gone down," tweeted Ukraine's ministry of defence."What's next in line, Russkies?" it went on.Ukraine's inventive social media activists are gleefully pumping out memes to celebrate the occasion. And Ukraine's second largest bank, Monobank, says it has already issued a new debit card design featuring the collapsed bridge.Oleksii Danilov, Secretary of Ukraine's National Security Council, wasn't the only one noting that the attack came just a day after Vladimir Putin's 70th birthday, tweeting a video of the damaged bridge next to Marilyn Monroe's famous performance of Happy Birthday, Mr President from 1962.The sense of excitement is palpable.Coming on the back of weeks of mostly good news from the battlefront, where Ukrainian forces continue to take back territory seized by Russia back in February and March, the sight of the crippled, burning bridge is a massive additional boost to morale.Bridge explosion 'the beginning', says Zelensky adviserHow was this done? Any number of theories are doing the rounds - from a Ukrainian special forces operation to the work of partisans in Crimea, a missile strike, or even a suicide bomb."This is a masterpiece of clandestine sabotage," a former senior British army explosives expert told me. "A well-planned attack from below may have been the cause," he said. "With structural demolition, you always plan a 'collapse mechanism' which lets the weight of the structure do the majority of the work."Ukrainian officials are giving little away, happy to apply the same level of ambiguity that followed a mysterious attack on the Russian airbase in Crimea in August.But the attacks on the Saky base and the bridge are all part of the same wider effort: to undermine Russia's ability to use Crimea as a launch pad for its war in southern Ukraine. The road and railway bridges are vital links in Russia's supply chain. Without them, Moscow will find it even harder to send troops and equipment to repel Ukraine's offensive north of Kherson.Kyiv is also saying to Moscow: Crimea is ours and eventually we are going to take it back. For all the giddy delight ricocheting across social media, some Ukrainians are anxious.This morning, we left the city of Zaporizhzhia, which is still in shock after Russian missile attacks on Thursday, which left at least 17 civilians dead.People there suspect that they are being punished by Russia as Moscow lashes out after its recent military failures. They fear the coming days may bring more. </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Merlyn Thomas"><Text>Haiti has asked for foreign military support to curb its gang violence crisis which has paralysed the country.The Haitian government authorised Prime Minister Ariel Henry to request armed help due to "the risk of a major humanitarian crisis". The US meanwhile urged its citizens in Haiti to leave due to the insecurity.A group of powerful gangs have blocked the country's main fuel terminal since September, crippling its basic supplies like water and food.It is not clear to whom the request for intervention has been sent to, and in what form the help would be given.The UN said it had not received an official request from Haiti's government."That being said, we remain extremely concerned about the security situation in Haiti, the impact its having on the Haitian people, on our ability to do our work, especially in the humanitarian sphere," said UN spokesperson, Stephane Dujarric.The US is also considering a request for a humanitarian corridor to restore fuel distribution within Haiti, according to state department spokesperson Vedant Patel.Mr Patel did not say where the troops to support this would come from.Varreux fuel terminal has been controlled and blockaded by a coalition of powerful gangs since last month, which has ground the whole country to a halt. Some hospitals have shut, while businesses and transport services stopped working in protest of destitution. Civil unrest escalated since Mr Henry announced an end to government fuel subsidies on 11 September, which sent petrol and diesel prices skyrocketing.Since then, protests and looting have intensified, with the capital, Port-au-Prince, at the heart of it. Food aid warehouses have been targeted, with an estimated $5m (£4.6m) worth of food aid lost in repeated attacks, according to Haiti's UN envoy. It is unclear whether the Haitian government request for foreign military intervention would mean the return of UN peacekeeping troops, after leaving five years ago. The UN's presence has left a mixed legacy in Haiti: its peacekeepers accepted partial responsibility for sparking a cholera epidemic more than a decade ago which killed about 10,000 people. Haiti's government said eight people had died on Sunday from cholera, for the first time in three years - raising concerns over the potential for a health crisis too. Of the many supplies that have been blocked by the country's gangs, clean water is a vital one - especially as cholera is spread via contaminated water. Haiti is one of the poorest countries in the world and has suffered a number of recent crises, most notably the assassination of its president, Jovenel Moïse, in July 2021 and a massive earthquake that left more than 2,200 people dead just a month later.Deaths are frequent, with more than 200 people killed in gang violence in Port-au-Prince in the space of just 10 days in July, according to figures from the UN.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Merlyn Thomas"><Text>Ukraine says two mass burial sites have been found in the recently-recaptured eastern town of Lyman, after Russian retreated.The Ukrainian governor of the Donetsk region, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said one burial site had about 200 individual graves containing civilian bodies.It was unclear how many bodies the second site held, but it may contain both soldiers and civilians, he said.The time and cause of death for the deceased is yet to be determined. The BBC was not able to independently verify the claims. Mr Kyrylenko, writing on Telegram, said officials had begun investigating both burial sites. He also asked people not to speculate on the details until the investigation was completed.Russia withdrew its troops from the strategic town of Lyman, in a significant setback for its campaign in eastern Ukraine. Lyman is in Donetsk - one of four partially-occupied Ukrainian regions which Moscow declared it was annexing. Ukraine and its Western allies have dismissed the move as an illegal land-grab.Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has previously accused Russia of deliberately killing civilians in other locations in Ukraine.Mr Zelensky said that mass graves were found this spring in Bucha, near the capital Kyiv, and also near Mariupol - the key south-eastern Ukrainian port now occupied by Russia since its invasion of Ukraine in February.Investigators and journalists found what appeared to be evidence of the deliberate killing of civilians in Bucha and other nearby areas.Ukrainian forces said they found mass graves and evidence that civilians had been killed after their feet and hands were bound.Hundreds of graves were also found outside the eastern city of Izyum days after Russian troops retreated, according to Ukrainian authorities. It is unclear what happened to the victims, but early accounts suggest some may have died from shelling and a lack of access to healthcare. </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Omar Wally"><Text>A red toy motorbike sits in the corner of Mariam Kuyateh's home gathering dust.It was meant for her 20-month-old son, Musa, but he passed away in September. He is one of the 66 children in The Gambia who are thought to have died after being given a cough syrup that had been "potentially linked with acute kidney injuries", according to the World Health Organization.No-one in the family touches Musa's toy - a reminder of what has been lost.His 30-year-old mother, who has four other children, was in tears remembering what had happened to her son.Sitting in her home in a suburb of The Gambia's largest city, Serrekunda, she explained that his sickness started as a flu. After he was seen by a doctor, her husband bought a syrup to treat the problem."When we gave him the syrup, the flu stopped, but it led to another problem," Ms Kuyateh said. "My son was not passing urine."She returned to the hospital and Musa was sent for a blood test, which ruled out malaria. He was given another treatment, which did not work, and then a catheter was fitted, but he did not pass urine.Finally, the small child was operated on. There was no improvement."He couldn't make it, he died."Earlier this week, the WHO issued a global alert over four cough syrups in connection with the deaths in The Gambia.The products - Promethazine Oral Solution, Kofexmalin Baby Cough Syrup, Makoff Baby Cough Syrup and Magrip N Cold Syrup - were manufactured by an Indian company, Maiden Pharmaceuticals, which had failed to provide guarantees about their safety, the WHO said.The Indian government is investigating the situation. The firm has not responded to a BBC request for comment.There is a lot of anger in The Gambia over what has happened. There are growing calls for the resignation of Health Minister Dr Ahmadou Lamin Samateh, along with the prosecution of the importers of the drugs into the country."Sixty-six is a huge number. So we need justice, because the victims were innocent children," Ms Kuyateh said.Five-month-old Aisha was another victim.Her mother, Mariam Sisawo, realised one morning that after having taken the cough syrup, her baby was not passing urine.On an initial visit to the hospital, the 28-year-old was told that there was nothing wrong with her daughter's bladder. It took two more trips there on consecutive days before Aisha was referred to a hospital in the capital, Banjul, which was 36km (22 miles) away from their home in BrikamaBut after five days of treatment there, she died."My daughter had a painful death. At a certain time when the doctors wanted to fix a drip on her, they could not see her veins. Myself and two other women in the same ward, we all lost our children."I have two sons and Aisha was the only girl. My husband was very happy to have Aisha and he still can't come to terms with her death." The Gambia does not currently have a laboratory capable of testing whether medicines are safe and so they have to be sent abroad for checking, Gambia health services director Mustapha Bittay told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme.But Ms Sisawo believes the government should be more vigilant."This is a lesson for parents, but the greater responsibility is with the government. Before any drugs get in to the country, they should be properly checked if they are fit for human consumption or not," she said.Isatou Cham was too distressed to talk about the death of her two-year-and-five-month-old son, Muhammed.She left the living room of their home in Serrekunda crying with her two other children.Muhammed's father, Alieu Kijera, explained what had happened to his little boy.He said he was taken to hospital when he had a fever and was unable to pass urine. But the doctors were treating Muhammed for malaria and his condition was getting worse.The medics then said he should be treated in neighbouring Senegal, where the health service is thought to be better, but while there was some improvement, it still did not save him.Mr Kijera is angry that his country does not have a good enough health system and he was forced to travel abroad. "If there was equipment and the right medicine, then my son and many other children could have been saved," he said.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="BBC News, author unspecified"><Text>The school district in Uvalde, Texas, has suspended its entire police force following protests by parents of children killed in a shooting there. The suspension will be indefinite, the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District (UCISD) said in a statement.Recent developments "have uncovered additional concerns with department operations", it added. Nineteen children and two teachers died in the attack at Robb Elementary School on 24 May.Police have been accused of botching the response to the fatal shooting.A July investigation into the shooting by the Texas legislature found "systemic failures and egregiously poor decision-making" by those involved in the response.The UCISD is responsible for supervising the security of schools in the Uvalde area, including Robb Elementary.The school district's police force consisted of five officers and one security guard, according to its website.Their officers were among the first of nearly 400 police to respond to the attack by a rifle-wielding 19-year-old gunman, who was eventually shot and killed by a border patrol agent.State troopers have been asked to help provide security for the school district, the UCISD statement said.There are still two ongoing investigations into the police response to the school shooting. It recently emerged that a police officer newly hired by the Uvalde school district is being looked into for her conduct on the day of the shooting, while she was working as a state trooper. Officer Crimson Elizondo was fired from the force on Thursday. Also on Friday, the acting district police chief was placed on administrative leave while the director of student services of the Uvalde school district announced his decision to retire.Parent of the shooting's victims have been camped outside school offices for days. They praised the district's decision to suspend the entire police force."They don't know how to hire people, they don't know how to vet officers," mother Kimberly Rubio, told ABC News, adding that the move to suspend the entire force is "what we've been asking for - it's more than we've been asking for".The former head of the police department for the school district, Pete Arredondo, was fired in August. He was one of the first officers on the scene that day, and received much of the blame for the botched response. The Texas Department of Public Safety has said that Mr Arredondo wrongly told officers under his command to treat the situation as if they were dealing with a barricaded gunman rather than an active shooter, which would have prompted a more urgent enforcement reaction. </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="BBC News, author unspecified"><Text>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has declared a state of emergency to address a "crisis situation" over an influx of migrants.More than 17,000 have arrived in the city from the southern border since April.Republican states like Texas, Arizona and Florida have been sending migrants to Democratic areas in recent months. It's part of a row with the White House as unprecedented numbers of people arrive at the US-Mexico border.Since September, an average of five to six buses have been arriving in the city each day, Mr Adams said at a press conference on Friday. He said that one in five people in the city shelter system is currently an asylum seeker. Many of those arriving are families with school-aged children and are in serious need of medical care, he said. The influx is on track to cost New York $1bn (£900m) this fiscal year, and the mayor is calling for federal and state funding to help with the costs. "New Yorkers are angry," said Mayor Adams. "I am angry too. We have not asked for this. There was never any agreement to take on the job of supporting thousands of asylum seekers."He added: "The city is going to run out of funding for other priorities. New York City is doing all we can, but we are reaching the outer limit of our ability to help."The city's social services are "being exploited by others for political gain", he added.Three states - Texas, Arizona and Florida  - have transported migrants to Democratic-led areas, focusing on self-proclaimed "sanctuary" cities that limit their co-operation with federal immigration authorities.Why are migrants being sent to Democrat-run areas?Republican officials in border states say the tactic is aimed at mitigating the impact of migration flows.They have also said the measure is designed to increase pressure on the administration of President Joe Biden to do more to reduce the number of migrants crossing the southern US border, which has hit a record high this year.The Democratic-run city of El Paso, Texas, has been offering migrants free rides to New York City and Chicago as a means of alleviating the strain on city resources. El Paso alone has transported more than double the number of migrants - nearly 9,000 - to the two northern cities than have been sent by the Texas governor.El Paso officials say the rides are voluntary, and that they co-ordinate with the destination cities to help the migrants upon arrival. As part of his emergency declaration, the New York mayor issued an executive order that allows the city to dedicate resources to support the asylum seekers and expedite any response efforts. A spokeswoman for Texas Governor Greg Abbott dismissed the declaration by the mayor on Friday."The true emergency is on our nation's southern border where small Texas border towns are overrun and overwhelmed by hundreds of migrants every single day as the Biden administration dumps them in their communities," said Renae Eze.Ms Eze said that, as of October, Texas had sent around 3,100 migrants arriving in the state to New York on more than 60 buses.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Patrick Jackson"><Text>A tractor is one of the odder gifts for Vladimir Putin, as Russia's president, a pariah in the West since his invasion of Ukraine, turns 70.It was given him by his Belarusian ally, Alexander Lukashenko, whose country boasts a tractor works.Mr Lukashenko confirmed the news as he visited his fellow strongman's home city, St Petersburg, for talks.Mr Putin was hosting other leaders of ex-Soviet states as the war fanned by his invasion raged.Faced with successful Ukrainian counter-attacks, he hinted at problems this week, describing the situation in regions he recently annexed as "restive".But on Friday, his allies lavished praise and gifts on the man who has led Russia, whether as president or prime minister, for more than two decades.Mr Lukashenko, Europe's self-styled "last dictator" who has been in power even longer than the Russian leader (since 1994) and whose administration is also under Western sanctions, came to St Petersburg with a gift certificate for the Belarusian-made vehicle.Belarus, Ukraine, Russia activists win Nobel prizeThe Minsk Tractor Works is the flagship of Belarusian industry.It was not immediately clear how Mr Putin responded to the big-wheeled gift, which had to compete with mountains of melons and watermelons from Tajikistan's President, Emomali Rahmon.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterHowever, it is a fact that Mr Putin has been frequently seen in tractors for some years now.Along with the gifts came praise for Mr Putin for "transforming the image of Russia, strengthening its sovereignty and its defence capability, and protecting its national interests", in the words of the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill."The number one patriot in the world" was how Ramzan Kadyrov, Chechnya's Moscow-backed leader, put it.Further afield, but dealing with similar international isolation, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un congratulated the man in the Kremlin for "crushing the challenges and threats of the United States".Mr Putin's enemies used the occasion of his birthday again to depict him as a war criminal trying to destroy another country while ruining his own.Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov called on Russia's military to reject him and refuse to fight his war, saying Mr Putin was "hiding in a bunker rather than standing" with his soldiers.Some social media users noted the irony of Mr Lukashenko's gift to Mr Putin: the humble tractor became an early symbol of Ukrainian resistance to the Russian invasion after farmers were seen towing away abandoned military vehicles.     In the Czech capital, Prague, demonstrators mocked Russia's president with a giant dummy depicting him as a naked emperor sitting on a golden toilet.  </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="BBC News, author unspecified"><Text>A jailed Belarus activist and two groups from Ukraine and Russia have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for championing human rights and democracy.The decision to honour Ales Bialiatsky, Russia's Memorial and the Ukrainian Centre for Civil Liberties (CCL) is a rebuff to two authoritarian leaders.Russia forced Memorial to close last December, ahead of Vladimir Putin's decision to invade Ukraine.Bialiatsky was imprisoned amid protests against Belarus's Alexander Lukashenko.Ukraine's CCL has monitored political persecutions and crimes against humanity in areas of the country occupied or annexed by Russia.Norwegian Nobel Committee head Berit Reiss-Andersen told reporters that all three had made "an outstanding effort to document war crimes, human right abuses and the abuse of power".Asked whether the committee was sending a signal to Russia's leader on his 70th birthday, she pointed out that the Nobel prize was always awarded "for something and to somebody and not against anyone".Belarus's long-time ruler is a close ally of President Putin. After a re-election in 2020 that was widely condemned as rigged, he brutally cracked down on protesters and then allowed Russian forces to use his country as a launchpad in its war against Ukraine.ANALYSIS: Putin's dream of victory slips away in UkraineAles Bialiatsky, 60, founded Belarus rights group Viasna, which means spring, in 1996, two years after Mr Lukashenko came to power. He was first jailed in 2011, then last year, he was detained again without charge. He is one of 1,348 people who Viasna says are currently held as political prisoners in Belarus.Exiled opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya praised the Nobel committee's "recognition for all Belarusians fighting for freedom and democracy" and Bialiatsky's wife Natallia Pinchuk said she was "overwhelmed with emotion".A foreign ministry spokesman in Minsk said Alfred Nobel was "turning in his grave" following the decision to hand Bialiatsky the Nobel Peace Prize.Memorial is one of the oldest human rights groups in Russia. Led initially by another Peace Prize laureate, Andrei Sakharov, in the late 1980s, its work uncovered the true scale of Joseph Stalin's repression in the form of Gulag camps of forced labour, where tens of millions of people are thought to have died.But it went on to document more recent human rights abuses, including kidnappings and torture in the Russian republic of Chechnya. The head of its Chechen branch, Natalia Estemirova, was murdered in 2009. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterIn December 2021, Russia's Supreme Court liquidated Memorial, although it continues to operate in a harsh climate where criticism of the war in Ukraine is considered a criminal offence.The head of International Memorial, Elena Zhemkova, told the BBC that the Nobel prize would help their work: "We always said at Memorial that memory of the past and human rights have no boundaries. To understand the Soviet past demands joint efforts. No country can privatise the memory about the war and repression."However, officials in Moscow were less impressed. The head of Russia's human rights council, Valery Fadeyev, urged Memorial to reject the prize, describing it as completely discredited, Tass news agency reports.Although a Ukrainian organisation was jointly awarded the peace prize, there was some annoyance in Kyiv that it was shared with representatives of Belarus and Russia. "Neither Russian nor Belarusian organisations were able to organise resistance to the war. This year's Nobel is 'awesome'," tweeted presidential adviser Mikhailo Podolyak sarcastically.Ukraine's Centre for Civil Liberties has in recent months turned its attention to abuses committed by Russian forces, after spending the previous years documenting political persecution in Russian-annexed Crimea and crimes in areas of eastern Ukraine run by Russian-backed separatists.The centre's head, Oleksandra Matviychuk, said she was delighted they were sharing the prize with "our friends and partners at Memorial and Viasna". In order to give the hundreds of thousands of victims of war crimes a chance of justice, she said an international tribunal should be created to "bring Putin, Lukashenko and other war criminals to justice". </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Mark Lowen in Rome and Elsa Maishman in London"><Text>Central heating will be restricted in Italy this winter, as it becomes the latest country to take action on European gas supply shortages sparked by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Under a new government decree, buildings will face an extra fifteen days without central heating. Italians will also be told to turn their heating down by one degree, and off for an extra hour a day. Some buildings will be exempt, including nurseries and hospitals.The move comes as governments across Europe look to reduce demand and shore up energy supplies ahead of winter. Many were dependent on gas from Russia, which has been restricted following the war in Ukraine. Before February's invasion, Italy was the second-largest importer of Russian gas in the EU, with imports making up 40% of its total supply. This is now down to just 10%, as Rome has turned to other sources of energy and liquified natural gas. The country normally restricts the use of central heating in warmer months, with its use determined by regional governments. With bills already soaring, reactions from Italians have been mixed."For old people who will stay at home a lot of time, probably it will be a problem for them," one told the BBC."It's probably needed, but it's hard. Now that this crisis is affecting us personally, it could lead more people to change their view on still backing sanctions on Russia," said another.How are countries tackling energy bills? EU leaders consider how to cap gas pricesHow can the world cope without Russian oil and gas?Many European governments have announced similar energy-saving plans. In France, homes and offices will be heated to a maximum of 19C, there will be no hot water in public buildings, and the temperature in swimming pools and gyms will also be reduced. A ban on doors being left open in heated or air-conditioned shops, which was previously in effect in some areas, has been extended nationwide. Spain has also previously mandated that heating not rise above 19C, as well as ordering that doors should be closed so as not to waste heat and that lights in shop windows must be turned off after 22:00.And Germany has stopped lighting up public monuments and buildings for aesthetic reasons, and warned heating may be turned off in the entrances, corridors and foyers of public buildings. At an EU summit in Prague on Friday, leaders are discussing capping wholesale gas prices to protect consumers.Many individual states have already introduced national caps on the price consumers pay for units of energy. Other measures have already been agreed across the bloc, including windfall taxes on surplus profits made by fossil fuel companies, and a levy on excess profits made by non-gas electricity producers.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Nathan Williams"><Text>A fire has damaged the enigmatic statues on Easter Island, with some of the charring said to be irreparable. An unknown number of the stone-carved statues have been affected by the blaze, Chile's cultural heritage undersecretary said.Easter Island has nearly 1,000 of the megaliths, known as moai. They have oversized heads and generally stand about 4m (13ft) high. They were carved by a Polynesian tribe more than 500 years ago. The fire, which broke out on Monday, affected nearly 60 hectares (148 acres), cultural heritage official Carolina Perez Dattari tweeted.It is reported to have been started deliberately, and is centred around Easter Island's Rano Raraku volcano - which is a Unesco World Heritage Site.Easter Island lies 3,500km (2,174 miles) off the coast of Chile. It relies on tourism and reopened just three months ago following its closure during the Covid-19 pandemic. The site has now been closed again while a conservation team examines the extent of the damage.The island's Mayor, Pedro Edmunds, told local media: "The damage caused by the fire can't be undone." The are some 1,000 giant stone statues and carvings on Easter Island, the largest of which weigh 74 tonnes and stand 10m tall.The figures were carved by the indigenous Rapa Nui people sometime between the years of 1400 and 1650, and positioned to form a ring around the island, facing inland.They were figures of spiritual devotion for the Rapa Nui, embodying the spirit of a prominent ancestor. Each one was considered to be the person's living incarnation.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Guy Hedgecoe"><Text>Spanish prosecutors are investigating a group of male university students filmed chanting obscene misogynistic abuse at female students in Madrid.Videos have circulated for days of abuse being hurled from the windows of an all-male student building late on Sunday at women in the block opposite.Spanish PM Pedro Sánchez criticised the "macho, inexplicable, unjustified and absolutely repugnant behaviour". It has drawn political condemnation and triggered widespread debate. One student shouted: "Whores, come out of your holes, bunnies. You are a load of nymphomaniac whores."Then, in a choreographed move, fellow students across the Colegio Mayor Elías Ahuja building pulled opened their blinds and started shouting and making animal noises. As Sunday night's video of students from Complutense University went viral, there was an immediate backlash from politicians across the spectrum.Socialist party prime minister Mr Sánchez said: "We should not give any excuse for these behaviours which surely don't represent the general feeling of Spanish society."I think it's important that all political parties and the media express a clear 'no' to these macho behaviours, and do not give a take a single step back on real equality between men and women."The leader of the conservative opposition Popular Party, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, called for society "to finish with these intolerable sexist attitudes".  Madrid's public prosecutor has opened an investigation to decide whether the incident amounts to a hate crime. The scandal has left the Elías Ahuja residence under national scrutiny. In a statement it said the episode had been "incomprehensible and inadmissible" and "contrary to the ideas and values" of the institution. It has expelled the alleged ringleader and said that others involved will attend a course on gender equality.  However, some of the residents of the Santa Mónica all-female building, which was the target of the abuse, have apparently defended the male students implicated and claimed that the incident has been blown out of proportion.  A statement attributed to residents of the Santa Mónica accommodation said: "Despite the seriousness of their words, this is a practice which is a tradition between university residences, which has created an impression of hate and sexism which could not be further from reality."It was not clear how many female residents supported the statement, which was posted on social media. And others have given a very different view. Ángela Ruiz, a former resident of Santa Mónica, wrote: "I was one of those 'Mónica whores' and I heard these kinds of shouts EVERY DAY for the two years I was at the residence."  This affair comes as Spain's coalition government has been making efforts to promote gender equality and eliminate violence against women. In May, congress approved legislation, known as the "Only yes means yes law", making it easier for victims of sexual violence to prosecute their assailants by emphasising the importance of consent.  A study last year found that one in five young Spanish men did not believe that gender violence existed, instead seeing it as an "ideological invention". Meanwhile, another disturbing video apparently of the Elías Ahuja residence from several years ago has been circulating. In it, students are shown making what appears to be a Nazi salute as they sing the words "Sieg Heil". </Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="BBC News, author unspecified"><Text>In our series of letters from African journalists, Ismail Einashe meets some Kenyan musicians with a cult following who are challenging the status quo.Crystal Axis, a five-piece Afro-punk band, has established itself as one of the leading group on Kenya's burgeoning rock music scene. I find them rehearsing in a recording studio at the International Trade Fair Grounds, on the outskirts of the Kenyan capital, Nairobi.One of the guitarists plays distorted riffs on his instrument with a scratchy, heavy sound as the drummer energetically beats his drums. The group is made up of Ahmed Bulhan, known as AB, on vocals, Djae Aroni and Fox Elijah on guitar, Doug Kihoro on bass and Dan Gichia on drums and percussion.Their origin lies in Nairobi's late noughties alternative music scene, which had a number of bands performing everything from indie rock and punk to heavy metal. At the time Aroni was at school when one night he snuck out of home to see a post-hardcore band, Jack the Hammer. The lead singer and guitarist happened to be Elijah. Seeing Elijah rocking it out on stage in his black skinny jeans, classic Vans and fierce punk attitude had an impact - and the next day Aroni went to school and told his friends he wanted to start his own rock band. Shortly afterwards in 2009 he set up Crystal Axis and was soon joined by AB, with Elijah and Kihoro joining in 2017 and Gichia last year.Growing up as teenage rockers and performing while still in secondary school posed its problems, says Aroni.They had to dodge bouncers at clubs who demanded to see their IDs: "We literally had to bribe our way into our own gigs."Unlike most young Kenyans who are into Afrobeats or hip-hop, the raw energy of punk rock was their inspiration.For Aroni it came from watching US group Green Day's live film Bullet in a Bible and seeing lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong holding his crotch while gyrating wildly on stage. He thought to himself then: "This is what I want to do."His bandmate Kihoro was inspired by listening to Scandinavian death metal, while drummer Gichia honed his musical skills in his teens playing in a local Christian rock band. In 2017 the band released their first major EP, Leopold - a commentary on the mass colonial atrocities committed by King Leopold II of Belgium in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo. Since then they have released three more EPs that have garnered them a devoted following in Kenya and internationally - people drawn to their bold, infectious and distinctly punk rock sound. Their lyrics, in English and a smattering of Swahili, are highly political and delve into everything from colonial history and corruption to racism. "[We want to] tell African stories from an African perspective," Aroni says.Their hit single Nyayo House addresses the legacy of Daniel arap Moi, Kenya's longest-serving president, who led what became known as the "Nyayo regime". The raging lyrics shine a light on a harrowing aspect of Kenyan oppression and are an indictment of an era when there was no freedom of expression in the East African nation.Nyayo House is a high-rise government building in central Nairobi infamous for its torture chambers used for opponents of Moi, who was in power from 1978 to 2002. "We are dissidents… Nyayo is sickening," scream the lyrics of the song, which AB says is about "generational trauma" and the need for Kenyans to speak about this history. In August Crystal Axis released their latest EP, Black AF, a celebration of contemporary African identities.It draws on their own experiences as young black Africans who contend with various challenges such as corruption, but is also a celebration of their strength, talent and creativity. The band also wants to use the power of punk rock music to create a space for young Kenyans to make this music on their own terms.Another aspiration is to reclaim punk rock history, which they say has been "whitewashed" and the contribution of black punk artists often forgotten. Aroni gives the example of black pioneers like Death, a proto punk band founded in Detroit in 1971, which tends not to be credited for its development of the early punk sound.In the late 1970s punk heyday other black bands also played an important role in the explosive growth of the genre with groups such as Pure Hell, formed in Philadelphia in 1974, and X-Ray Spex, formed in London in 1976 by the Somali-British punk pioneer Poly Styrene.As part of their efforts to challenge the image of punk rock music as a genre dominated by white, male bands, Crystal Axis was meant to play at the Decolonise Fest in the UK last month.The festival celebrates punk music by people of colour, but the band members were denied visas to enter the UK - much to their outrage and disappointment as they had sold out shows in Leeds, Manchester and London. But this has not dented their ambition - and they see punk rock as a powerful means to channel their rage, intellectual curiosity, joy and hopes.In the recent Kenyan elections the majority of the band members did not vote, with Kihoro saying Kenyan politics is "full of old men".Aroni agrees, adding that most young Kenyans feel powerless to alter the political landscape: "We are disenfranchised. There's nothing we can do."Yet Crystal Axis' lyrics are a warning that young people should not be ignored.Their 2020 song Take The Throne about "over policing" in Kenya and the violence of the state explodes with words: "Send your soldiers, send your mob. We're 50 million, and we're tenfold strong."Rip it down! We'll build again from scratch.

It focussed its attention on two permanent members of the UN Security Council: China and Russia.The Human Rights Council is the world's top human rights body. Its mandate is to promote human rights everywhere, to condemn violations everywhere, without fear or favour.The council has done some excellent work. Its commission of inquiry for Syria has produced painstaking, forensic reports several times a year since that long conflict began in 2011. The fact-finding mission for Myanmar reported in graphic detail the suffering of the Rohingya community, and made it clear that Myanmar's ruling junta were responsible.Of course, no country, big or small, likes sitting on the council's naughty step, and they all try to avoid it. But some succeed, and others do not.  This week, China succeeded, to the bitter disappointment of human rights groups.In August, minutes before she left office, the outgoing UN Human Rights Commissioner Michelle Bachelet finally published her report on violations against Uyghur Muslims in China's Xinjiang province. As many rights activists had predicted, it contained evidence of widespread abuse, from arbitrary detention, to forced labour, to torture. Abuse which could amount, Ms Bachelet said, to crimes against humanity.Torture claims against China Uyghurs credible - UNWho are the Uyghurs? 'Don't turn a blind eye to Uyghur suffering'The logical next step after a report like that is a debate at the Human Rights Council, the appointment of a special expert to monitor the country concerned, or even a full-blown commission of inquiry. Western diplomats, led by the US and the UK, took a minimalist approach and asked only for a debate, and they lost.China lobbied hard, especially among African countries which have benefitted from Beijing's investment. Its ambassador suggested most of the world was weary of the west's "political manipulation". It's us today, he told developing nations, it will be you tomorrow. When the votes were counted, just 17 member states supported a debate, 19 rejected it, and 11 abstained. Just one African country - Somalia - said yes. Most, from Mauritania, to Senegal, to Ivory Coast and Cameroon, backed China.The vote reflects China's position as a global superpower, able to influence smaller UN member states who may rely on it for economic support. But it also, as the next vote about Russia showed, reveals deep divisions about what human rights are, and who should be defending them.Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Moscow's diplomats, who once strode purposefully from meeting to meeting at the United Nations in Geneva, have been increasingly isolated. Russia was ousted from its seat on the Human Rights Council last March, and can now only participate as an observer. When this week's resolution to appoint a UN special rapporteur to monitor human rights in Russia came up for discussion, Western diplomats and rights activists were confident it would be approved.The crackdown on dissent in Russia has become ever more brutal, with mass arrests, beatings and the suppression of independent media. Russian human rights groups bravely continuing their work were looking to the UN for support.Like the resolution on China, the proposal on Russia went to a vote, and this time it was passed. "Happy 70th birthday, Mr Putin," tweeted one jubilant Western diplomat. But examine the votes, and there really is not much for the West to celebrate. Just 17 council members voted in favour, six said no, and a staggering 24 abstained. Again and again countries who abstained - India, Pakistan, Mexico, Armenia, Honduras - argued that finger pointing was not constructive. Dialogue please, they said, not blame. Sovereign countries need to deal with these issues themselves, it was suggested, without unwanted interference from do-gooders in the West.These arguments have been taking place at the UN Human Rights Council for years, but never have they been so stark. Human rights, or so the declaration of 1948 says, are supposed to be universal. The Human Rights Council is mandated to uphold, promote and defend them, and to call out violations. The member states on the council are supposed to work together, the common aim of universal human rights for all is supposed to take precedence over national interests, and geopolitical differences.Increasingly, that idea, created by those who had endured the horrors of World War Two, including Russia and China, looks like a fantasy. Powerful countries can use their power to avoid scrutiny, less powerful ones will join together to argue that they don't need any outside interference. The losers, rights groups say, will be not only the thousands of people who suffer repression and abuse, but all of us.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Sam Cabral"><Text>US cannabis policy has been thrust to the fore after President Joe Biden issued a blanket pardon for Americans federally convicted of possessing small amounts of the drug.Mr Biden also urged governors to do likewise on state offences and called for a review on whether cannabis should be listed as a less serious drug.Federal law currently classifies cannabis as a Schedule I controlled substance, meaning it has "no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse".As one White House official noted, that's "the same schedule as for heroin and LSD, and it's even higher than the classification for fentanyl and methamphetamine - the drugs that are driving [America's] overdose epidemic"."It makes no sense," Mr Biden said on Thursday, as he directed his attorney general and health secretary to oversee a review."Too many lives have been upended because of our failed approach to marijuana. It's time that we right these wrongs."The news came as a surprise to many, but it has set cannabis stocks ablaze. Advocates say the move is a first - albeit overdue - step to bringing a $33bn (£30bn) industry out of the shadows and providing relief to those impacted by a "war on drugs" that began in the 1970s."It's a welcome conversation starter," said Kassandra Frederique, executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance non-profit."We've been waiting for some action around cannabis reform federally, so we welcome the opportunity to use it for a much broader conversation about reform."As the White House itself has noted, Mr Biden's pardons - for "simple possession" - are limited in scope. Only about 6,500 people with federal convictions and some District of Columbia (DC) residents are eligible for the relief.That's because, while nearly 29 million Americans have been arrested for cannabis-related violations since 1965, nobody is currently in federal prison solely for possession. In addition, most convictions for possession are at the state and local level, and presidential pardons only apply to federal charges.Ms Frederique argues, however, that the president's actions have "put teeth behind" efforts to relieve the perceived harms of cannabis prohibition.Organisations like hers are calling on the president to de-schedule the drug - that is, repeal cannabis from the US Controlled Substances Act of 1970 and regulate it in the same way as alcohol or tobacco."Without de-scheduling, people are going to keep facing criminal charges and be denied federal benefits; marijuana research will continue to face hindrances; veterans won't be able to access medical cannabis programmes; federal employees can still be fired for using cannabis; entrepreneurs and businesses will not have access to funding; and, banks will continue to be hesitant to offer loans," Ms Frederique said.If the Biden-initiated review does ultimately call for re-classifying cannabis, the federal government will be catching up to reforms already underway in several US states.Currently, 37 states and DC have legalised medical cannabis, while 19 states have approved the drug for recreational use. That represents well over 40% of the US population.Voters in five more states - Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota and South Dakota - will cast ballots next month on whether to allow recreational cannabis use, with at least four more ballot referendums expected in 2023 and 2024.It is a reflection of how much the politics of cannabis reform have changed over a short period of time. A Gallup poll last year showed that a record 68% of Americans are now in favour of legalising the drug.And, while Democrats and independents are far more likely to support loosening restrictions on cannabis use, about half of Republicans are also on board, the poll shows.Reacting to Mr Biden's announcement on Thursday, Republican congresswoman Nancy Mace of South Carolina gave "credit where credit is due"."I don't always agree with the Biden administration, I've been very vocal about that, but this is a step in the right direction," Ms Mace told the Fox Business Network.In fact, Mr Biden's actions represent an about-face on his own track record as a lawmaker. He claims to have never touched cannabis and, over a 35-year tenure in the US Senate, authored and voted in favour of many tough-on-drug laws.Industry experts expect that broad praise for his Thursday announcement will benefit the president and his party in midterm elections next month that threaten Democrats' control of Washington."Moving to repeal the federal prohibition of marijuana isn't just good policy. It's good politics," Paul Armentano, deputy director of the National Organisation for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) advocacy group, told the BBC.He argued that, by engaging with the matter from his bully pulpit, the president is "taking an issue that has been seen politically as a fringe issue, and has legitimised it".But it is only Congress - not the president - who can unilaterally act to amend or repeal cannabis prohibition.Bills to de-schedule cannabis and to ease the financial burdens on cannabis retailers have passed this year in the US House of Representatives - but none of these efforts have advanced in the upper chamber of Congress. That is in spite of vocal backing for certain measures by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who holds the power to bring bills to the floor but has been unable to garner enough support. "By having the most powerful elected politician in this country talking about marijuana policy and taking steps to impact marijuana policy, that has elevated this debate," said Mr Armentano."He has squarely put the pressure back on Congress, where it belongs, and said: it's up to you to finish the job."</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Laura Bicker in North-east Thailand &amp; Frances Mao in Singapore"><Text>Duangphan Patphaothanun is wandering outside a childcare centre, clutching a bag full of toys. The 64-year-old grandmother wants to know when she can see her grandson, so she can place his most treasured possessions with him in his coffin - the bag includes a large plastic dinosaur. Three-year-old Pattarawut is among the 23 children who died on Thursday in a gun and knife attack at a childcare centre in Thailand's north-east. A former policeman had stormed the building, killing children as young as two while they slept, leaving at least 37 people dead. More than 90 children usually attend the centre but because of poor weather and a bus breakdown only 24 of them were there on Thursday. Only one child has survived.Police say the 34-year-old attacker - a local named Panya Kamrab - killed his wife and his step-son, before killing himself after a manhunt. His step-son used to attend the centre but hadn't been for the past month. The motive for the attack is not yet known. But police said Kamrab was fired from his job in June for drug use. "When I heard the news about the shooting, I just fainted," Duangphan said. On her phone are photos of Pattarawut, taken just hours before the shooting. Like many childcare centres, this one too regularly posts photo updates for parents to see - the images show happy, smiling faces, writing or finishing a drawing. Duangphan was one of several grieving relatives who had gathered outside the centre in Nong Bua Lamphua province on Friday morning. Another grandmother, 46-year-old Nipha Lawongsechaison, says she lost both a grandson and granddaughter in the attack."I am full of such pain... [and] anger because I cannot do anything," she says. She's not the only one. Others too say they are filled with grief - and unanswered questions. "Why did he take it [out] on the children? Why kill them when they did nothing to him?" says 27-year-old Naliwan Dungkhet, whose two-year-old nephew Captain also died in the attack. He was just a month away from his third birthday. 'It's shocking' - witnesses describe nursery attack horrorThai pre-school attack: What we knowAmong the mourners was Komsan Norraburh. His ex-wife married the attacker who killed both her and Norraburh's three-year-old son, Worraphat."I was at the factory [when] my friend asked me to check the news. I called my ex-wife and son to see if they were ok but no-one answered," he said. "He was a good boy who liked to talk a lot. I'm waiting to pick up his body and see his face one last time."Many of the relatives said they had waited outside the childcare centre well into the night on Thursday, while others gathered at the police station.They would eventually be greeted by the sight of pink and white coffins adorned with gold, bearing the bodies of the children, which were brought to a hospital morgue in Udon Thani and laid out in rows. Police said the armed attacker broke into the building just after lunch time on Thursday, shooting his way past a teacher and parent outside. He was recognised by one of the teachers when he burst in.Witnesses said he first shot staff - including a teacher who was eight months pregnant- before forcing his way past teachers into a room where children were napping. He then stabbed most of his victims before fleeing.Officers who rushed to the nursery were confronted with the bodies of adults and children, lying inside and outside the building. Kamrab had appeared in court the morning of the attack on charges related to the use and possible sale of methamphetamine. He had been due to face a verdict on Friday.Mass shootings in Thailand are rare, although gun ownership rates are relatively high for the region. In 2020 a soldier killed 29 people and injured dozens more in the city of Nakhon Ratchasima. Thursday's attack comes less than a month after an army officer shot dead two of his colleagues at a base in Bangkok.Additional reporting by Suchada Phoisaat</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Stephen McDonell"><Text>The idea was to have China in stable and tip-top shape when thousands of delegates gather in Beijing to usher in a historic third term in power for Xi Jinping.However, the coronavirus is not playing nicely.In recent weeks, tens of millions of people have again been confined to their homes in lockdowns across 60 towns and cities and this is bringing political pressure on the man who has become the most powerful Chinese figure since the first Communist-era leader Mao Zedong.The government's ongoing "Dynamic zero-Covid" strategy is inextricably linked to Mr Xi. Its success is his success. Its failure? Well, it would be a brave person who tried to pin it on him.Elsewhere, vaccine rollouts have meant learning to live with the virus, but this one major economy stands alone, clinging to a response designed to quash every outbreak.Strict lockdowns, mass testing, constant scanning of health codes and travel restrictions have stopped China's hospitals from being swamped. But it's come at a cost - official youth unemployment stands at 18.7%. Earlier this year it was nudging 20%. Yet even in the face of significant economic and societal pressure, the government has not really turned to the one thing which might hasten an end to the crisis. While it has been prepared to enforce strict compliance in all other areas of Covid policy, it has not pushed vaccination with anywhere near the same enthusiasm.There is no compulsion to be vaccinated. There's barely a public awareness campaign.And it has stubbornly limited vaccination to locally developed vaccines only when research shows they are not as efficient as those produced internationally. It really does look like national pride trumping science.To an extent, this superpower is getting by. Nearly a fifth of the earth's population are, in one way or another, going about their daily lives inside a giant bubble. But they are doing this while people's livelihoods are being smashed.This week, rail services out of Xinjiang were suspended and many parts of the western region including its capital Urumqi were under lockdown as officials admitted they had failed to stop the virus spreading. China's stricter lockdowns have seen widespread reports of people unable to source food and medicine - but zero-Covid is affecting people's daily lives in myriad other ways too.Three years into the crisis, this is exhausting the population.On the outskirts of Beijing, workers on modest incomes live in an area called Yanjiao because the rent is cheaper. It is on the other side of a river, just inside neighbouring Hebei province.In normal times, this wouldn't matter but in the pandemic it can mean having to run the gauntlet of roadblocks to travel from where you live to where you work.In June this year, a cluster of cases saw people living in Yanjiao prevented from entering the capital, leading to clashes between police who were enforcing the border closure and employees trying to get to work.Since then, locals have been seen paddling across the water in inflatable craft to sneak into the city.At the time of writing, the border is open but everyone entering Beijing must show their IDs which are linked to health code apps.Every morning in Yanjiao, buses can be seen lined up, stopping before they cross over, so police can board and check that everyone has a clean bill of health.The delays have made the commuters of Yanjiao seem unreliable in the eyes of employers."Many people who live in this area got fired by their companies," said one woman in the queue for the bus. "And, if they find new work, they might get treated unfairly again."We take a train from Beijing to Xi'an. Upon arrival there is a huge logjam at the station, as thousands of travellers attempt to download the local health app after coming down the stairs from the platform. Then everyone has to do a new PCR test before leaving the station.Xi'an has been a driver of inland China's economy since the years when it was the start of the old Silk Road stretching across central Asia into the Middle East and Europe. These days, the city is supposed to be one of the county's top tourist draws.We meet Addison Sun, a specialist English-language tour guide and ask him how damaging the pandemic has been for his industry"Wow! For international tourism 100%," he says. "Because no one can come to China, no one can come to Xi'an."The number of domestic tourists prepared to travel is also way down. If you are visiting somewhere and a few coronavirus cases emerge, the city can be locked down. But even if it isn't, your own city can suddenly decide not to accept you back if you've been somewhere with infections. You're stranded, sometimes for an extended period, and you have to pay for your accommodation and other needs.There have been several stay-at-home lockdowns in Xi'an, one keeping 13 million people indoors for a month. So at times the sites at the home of the famed Terracotta Warriors have been empty.As his work stopped, Addison Sun says he slipped into depression."No income. This is my lowest point," he says. "And, you know, as a man, I couldn't do anything. I'd ask my wife, 'Hi darling can you give me 100 or 200 [yuan]'?"He pulled himself out of the mire one day when looking at his eight-year-old - "I have to stand up because I should be the model. I'm the hero for my daughter" - and began posting virtual tours of Xi'an online. He's now also teaching English but longs for the day when foreign tourists return.The city's Muslim Quarter, which historians say dates back to the Tang Dynasty, should be packed with visitors. Stallholders still line the streets calling out, advertising the kebabs and sweets they have, but their restaurants have very few customers. Along the narrow lanes the tarps blow in the wind where shops have closed."I paid two years rent the day before the lockdown," says Zhang Min, who runs a little shop selling the belts and bags she makes.  "We're from the countryside. We just wanted to achieve something by ourselves."She breaks down describing how she had hoped to give her mother a better life. When does she think things will get back to normal? "It's hard to know," she says. "Outbreaks come again and again."For decades, China's economic transformation has been powered by exports, but zero-Covid means some overseas buyers are sourcing their products elsewhere because of fears of disruption to China's supply chains.Dieshiqiao in Jiangsu Province, just north of Shanghai, is a hub for the clothing industry.At a small factory, staff are hunched over their sewing machines, furiously making up for an entire season of lost production following a lockdown.The bosses had started to explain their recent challenges when a man walks in and starts secretly filming us on his phone. He then goes and speaks to the owners - the interview is off."I'm really sorry. We just can't do it," says one of the company owners. While people here are legally entitled to be interviewed, who would defy the Communist Party in this way? Five reasons why China's economy is in troubleBefore the pandemic, China's growth was around 6%. Its most recent GDP figure was 0.4%. The local government knows that zero-Covid is tanking the economy and doesn't want anyone speaking about it.In a small shop selling items for bedding, a woman tells us their sales are down by half.Then another woman suddenly appears in the shop, posing as a customer. "Hey what are you talking about?" she asks in an effort to appear genuinely curious.After we leave, she returns and questions the shop owners.One of the architects of the policy which has stopped the coronavirus from ripping through China is Professor Liang Wannian, head of the government's Covid expert panel.When we speak to him, he acknowledges that China's home-grown vaccines are not as effective at stopping infection as had been hoped, but says they do prevent severe illness and death.When does he thinks zero-Covid might come to an end? "It's hard to say," he replies. "Because one thing I am sure of is, we won't kill the virus any time soon. We're waiting for more effective medicines and more effective vaccines."A key blockage standing in the way of re-opening is the significant body of people who don't think it's safe to be vaccinated.The Chinese authorities are prepared to separate elderly grandparents and young children from their families and force them into quarantine centres or lock down entire cities for months, but vaccination doesn't feel like a priority. Some Chinese doctors have even been telling their patients that they should not get the shots. As a result many analysts don't believe that official statistics accurately reflect the true level of vaccination.Professor Liang knows there's a problem in this area."Many old people have underlying diseases. They reckon it won't be safe to get vaccinated. But in fact, it is safe. We need to get this message across," he says. It's a significant admission."China has been working on it but there's a lot of room for progress," he adds.Could zero-Covid be lifted after the Communist Party Congress in mid-October? "It's hard for me to answer that," he says with an awkward laugh. "I'm just a scholar".China has successfully minimised the impact of the virus - and if it re-opened tomorrow, the disease would spread like wildfire.But, at the moment, it feels like the government is just kicking the can down the road. Remaining cut off from the outside world is coming at a cost.There are no easy options, but China can't go on like this forever.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Paul Kirby"><Text>Across Europe, governments have been grappling with ways of protecting their consumers from rising energy bills, because the market has been hit by Russia's war in Ukraine.At an EU summit in Prague on Friday, 27 European leaders are being asked to back a cap on gas prices, even though several are wary of the idea.Fifteen countries want a Europe-wide limit imposed on the wholesale price of gas, while European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen agrees there should be some kind of temporary price cap.The recent explosions in Germany's Nord Stream 1 pipeline in the Baltic Sea were a clear illustration of how little European countries can now rely on Russian gas imports. Germany's gas network regulator has already warned that consumers are using more than in previous years and Italy has imposed limits on hours and temperatures for heating many buildings.Some countries warn that capping wholesale prices could affect the security of Europe's gas supply, as it would boost consumption. EU member states have already agreed other measures to protect consumers, with windfall taxes on surplus profits made by fossil fuel companies and a levy on excess profits made by non-gas electricity producers. They have also agreed on a mandatory 5% cut on peak electricity consumption.It's a start, but it's not long-term and not a structural reform. So what possible alternatives are there and could an EU price cap work?Many governments have already introduced national ceilings on the prices consumers pay for units of energy. But capping wholesale prices across the EU would be a major departure, and there are various ways of doing it.Ursula von der Leyen has proposed a series of measures to "dampen" the price paid for imports that she believes would not put supplies at risk.One of them involves negotiating a "corridor of prices" for imports from suppliers such as Norway and the US. Instead of a fixed price cap, an upper and lower price limit below current rates would be agreed with the countries involved.Norway has become the EU's biggest gas supplier since Russia launched its war - but Oslo believes imposing a maximum on wholesale gas prices will not solve Europe's biggest problem of having too little gas.Four EU countries want a "dynamic corridor" which would apply to all wholesale gas sales, not just those agreed with key suppliers. Poland, Belgium, Italy and Greece say a central value would be set and could be updated regularly in relation to the price of crude oil. The price could deviate from that value, perhaps by 5%.The Greek prime minister believes an upper limit that is not artificially low would not destabilise markets: "With high enough prices, suppliers will still send their gas to Europe, and consumers will still have reason to reduce their demand," says Kyriakos Mitsotakis.The head of the European Commission believes it is important to stop EU countries trying to outbid each other, as that only sends prices higher. She foresees joint purchasing of gas across a European energy platform, similar to how the EU bought Covid-19 vaccines. Another idea is to impose a temporary price cap on imported gas used to generate electricity. The advantage here is that this has already been tried in Spain and Portugal since June.The Iberian cap brought down the costs of wholesale electricity and saved households an average of 24.4% on their bills, according to one study, but apparently also led to increased demand. It is not clear if it could work more broadly.Italy wants to focus on replacing the existing Dutch-based TTF market hub, where prices have become increasingly volatile. Critics say the hub cannot properly assess the market value of LNG (liquefied natural gas) and can add 30% to the price of a commodity fast becoming increasingly important in Europe. EU energy commissioner Kadri Simson says work has begun on developing a "complementary EU price index" for LNG, but she has also raised the prospect of imposing a price cap purely on Russian gas. Until that alternative benchmark is up and running, Ursula von der Leyen suggests imposing a price limit on the TTF, to make clear that the EU is not ready to pay "whatever price" for gas.Last week, the German government forged ahead with a €200bn (£174bn) package to shield its businesses and consumers, bigger than any other EU country can afford.It went down very badly with several European partners. "We cannot divide ourselves according to the space in our national budgets, we need solidarity," complained Italy's outgoing prime minister, Mario Draghi.Part of the big German announcement is a gas price "brake", which would mean Berlin subsidising the actual market price. That is very different from a cap on the price paid to suppliers that each EU country would sign up to.The main risk, as European think tank Bruegel puts it, is that the German package could disrupt a European level playing field, with German business having a far greater chance of surviving the energy crisis than, say, Italian business.Two European commissioners, Paolo Gentiloni and Thierry Breton, said the German action raised the issue of how other countries with lesser resources could support their businesses and households. They want an EU-wide scheme similar to the low-cost loans provided in the Covid pandemic.French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire says Europe should respond with a lasting strategy that focuses on the principle of fair competition: "What is at stake is the competitiveness of our companies, the competitiveness of our industries."The problem for the EU is that it has an internal energy market with 27 states having a variety of energy mixes and they have to agree on a solution that works for all of them.Although the EU's storage facilities are about 90% full, the lack of Russian supplies means refilling them will prove hard. The International Energy Agency says if demand is not cut and Russian supplies are not replenished, then levels could drop to between 5% and 20%. It says EU gas demand will have to fall this winter by 9% on previous years to keep storage levels above a quarter."The most promising measure to actually bring down the average price is still the reduction of peak consumption," says Estonian minister Riina Sikkut.</Text></Article><Article paper="bbc" author="By Michael Dempsey"><Text>South Central Los Angeles is an area that has been tarnished with a troubled image. Both Hollywood and real-life crime stories have seen to that.Carlos Oyarbide, who teaches English Language Development in South Central LA, is all too familiar with its reputation as a regular visitor. "There's truth in the violent stereotype, but I choose to teach there. It is an immigrant hub with a great sense of loyalty and community. And that community has an entrepreneurial spirit."That spirit has been harnessed at Mr Oyarbide's school, Nava College Preparatory Academy. The school was the trial site for a scheme that has pitched using the metaverse to help teach English to students with a limited grasp of the language. The term metaverse is used to describe a series of virtual reality worlds that can be accessed through a browser or virtual reality (VR) headset.The idea behind the scheme is to harness the power of VR technology to bypass traditional teaching methods and plunge students into a world of possibility in a virtual universe.The idea that VR can be used to boost learning isn't new. In 2020, a study by business consultants PwC found that through the use of VR students could learn up to four times faster than in a traditional class setting.However, the falling price of VR headsets has now made them a more affordable teaching aid.For Mr Oyarbide, the possibility of sharpened focus among his easily distracted students had huge appeal. "I've been teaching for 12 years. If kids can figure out anything it is how not to pay attention! I wanted to try something different, do normal learning from books for one period and then switch to VR." In doing this, he discovered that a VR environment swept away the inhibitions of many of his students wrestling with learning a new language.He says the technique helped them practise their language skills without embarrassment.Typical tasks performed by his students inside the VR classroom involved building a shop while working out the English language required for signage and advertising.Students would usually use the VR equipment for two or three hours a week."They can feel intimidated speaking in English, but when it's just them and a VR avatar that's completely different." Despite the positive impact VR has had on his teaching methods, Mr Oyarbide is not a starry-eyed convert to the avalanche of metaverse hype typified by Facebook's rebranding as Meta.He says there is still great advantages to a traditional classroom setting. "The old approach to teaching through books does not go away. And you're not going to wear a headset for four hours a day. But it does allow you to reduce teacher talk and create a tangible space for a student's confidence to grow."Meanwhile, Marco Vargas's parents moved to Los Angeles from Guatemala. "I'm a first-generation everything - first-generation American and first-generation high school graduate. In high school I learnt how to navigate the education system and how to use resources by myself."As part of the first cohort to go through Nava, he missed the more modern VR headsets that are now used.Instead, Mr Vargas had a more stripped-down VR experience, using a cardboard viewer attached to a smartphone and Google software.Nevertheless, he says that his high school's embrace of technology was important for his own academic development.The immersive aspect of VR learning appeals to him, but he can also be critical of how his younger generation can take technology for granted after having it at their fingertips for so long. "Yes, we are digital natives, but we lack discipline. We fall prey to distractions." Proving that he could overcome any distraction, Mr Vargas won a Fulbright scholarship to study at Dartmouth, a prestigious Ivy League university.More technology of business:How to make movies without a huge carbon footprintHigh and low-tech ways to solve India's water crisisAre we falling in love with robots?Can drumming reconnect you to your colleagues?How graphene's superpowers could soon be unleashedToday, he works for Exponential Destiny, a non-profit organisation dedicated to introducing students at schools in disadvantaged areas to emerging technologies. It was Exponential Destiny that provided the VR headsets to Nava College.Marcus Shingles runs the firm. He was a high-flying business consultant at top-tier firms where he demonstrated new technologies to business leaders, and happily contrasts himself with his students."I'm a rich white guy," he says. Now, he is helping to plot routes into technology for teenagers who had previously never considered that such a career could be possible for them. "It's clear that the internet is evolving, so we take the time students have invested in mastering platforms like TikTok and show them that developing products in the metaverse doesn't require hard coding."He says the falling price of VR headsets is a chance to make the technology more accessible.  This approach to embedding metaverse technologies in teaching attracts students who don't see themselves as tech-oriented.Many of the students that have gone through Exponential Destiny are hired to help out at other schools and expand the scheme.Samantha Aguilar Araujo, the daughter of Salvadoran parents and the first in her family to attend high school, is one of them."I didn't consider myself a tech person, I'm definitely more on the creative side, but I heard about a new class and took it to see what it was like."She became enamoured with a virtual approach to building computing programs that bypasses traditional coding techniques that alienate many of those who aren't technologically adept.Fuelled by artificial intelligence this VR method is often referred to as no-code coding.More students in the US and overseas are likely to see these VR techniques in the coming months.Exponential Destiny has projects running in four schools at the moment, with plans to introduce the system to another two in the US and four schools outside the US.Back at Nava College a former pupil, Juan Felix, has returned to take a class of 18 students with limited English through the technology maze.His students discover routes into college or a career in a VR world where they can pull together the elements of covering letters and job application forms."It is crazy. They're not speaking English as a first language and they've not been exposed to the technology before, but despite these barriers they learn very quickly," he says.</Text></Article></Articles>
