Windows and windscreens were smashed in.The BBC saw half a dozen bodies lying at the scene, apparently civilians. Baggage and coats strewed the tarmac. One survivor told the BBC her boss had been killed in the attack."She had two kids. I left the cafe to use the restroom when it happened. I ran back and tried to find her. The cafe was demolished, there were many bodies around. It was all so very horrifying," Viktoriia Yosypenko said.Reacting to the attack in the early hours of Friday on the outskirts of the regional capital of the Zaporizhzhia region, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia was a "state-terrorist".He said Russia launched 16 rockets on the city, and vowed to punish perpetrators for "every lost Ukrainian life".Meanwhile, a Russian-installed local official blamed Ukraine for the attack.The convoy was hit as people were preparing to travel to the Russian-occupied part of the region to pick up their relatives and also deliver humanitarian aid.Tears and despair as Russian annexation loomsNear the missile's impact crater, the BBC spoke to Kateryna Holoborod, sat on her suitcase in a state of shock. 'We arrived in a line, to join a column going towards Kherson," she said. "We got out to see what number we had in the queue. Then the first rocket hit, behind the wagons. "We dropped to the ground. Then the second one hit in the centre of the queue. There was glass everywhere, people screaming and running. I don't remember much. "It was very scary. I then got up to see what happened, help the injured. I tried to help an injured young man when the third explosion happened."The attack comes as Russian President Vladimir Putin is preparing for a signing ceremony in Moscow to annex Zaporizhzhia along with Ukraine's Donetsk, Luhansk and Kherson regions.The move follows self-styled referendums in the eastern and southern regions, which have been condemned by Ukraine and the West as a sham.Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February, and Moscow currently controls the majority of the Zaporizhzhia region, including Europe's biggest nuclear power plant there - but not the regional capital.Moscow-installed regional official Vladimir Rogov blamed "Ukrainian militants" for the Zaporizhzhia attack, Russian state-run media reported.In a separate development, one person was killed and five injured in overnight Russian strikes by Iskander missiles on the central city of Dnipro, about 70km (43 miles) north of Zaporizhzhia, local officials said.They said a transport company was targeted, and as many as 52 buses were burnt and another 98 damaged.Several high-rise buildings, offices and a shop were also hit.You may also be interested in: </Text></Article><Article author="By Raffi Berg"><Text>About 20 members of a Jewish sect held at a facility in Mexico after a police raid on their jungle base have fled.Footage showed men, women, and children streaming out of the site in Huixtla, in the west, on Wednesday night.They had been there since the raid last Friday when two members were arrested on suspicion of human trafficking and serious sexual offences.The sect, Lev Tahor, is known for extremist practices and imposing a strict regime on its followers.It advocates child marriage, inflicts harsh punishments even for minor transgressions and requires women and girls as young as three years old to completely cover up with robes.Local media said members of the group had been protesting against their detention since their arrival, including rioting and assaulting personnel.Video from Reuters news agency shows the detainees, dressed in gold, grey and white robes, forcing their way past two guards at a gate as one of their members holds it open.One of the guards trying to hold them back falls down and the group climb over him as they make their escape. A youth is seen turning and kicking the guard as he lies on the ground.  It is unclear where the group has gone. Associated Press said they were collected by a lorry and headed towards the border with Guatemala, while news site El Heraldo de México said they went by foot for several miles before disappearing into the night.Their compound, 11 miles (17.5km) north of Tapachula in Chiapas state, was raided by an elite police unit after a months-long investigation and surveillance operation involving Mexican and Guatemalan authorities and a private four-man team from Israel including former Mossad and domestic intelligence agents.Twenty-six members were found at the site, among them Israelis with dual citizenships including Canada, the US and Guatemala, Israel's foreign ministry said.It said a Canadian and an Israeli citizen were arrested, while two other wanted members reportedly left the compound two days before the raid and are being sought. Five more were detained for allegedly breaking immigration rules.The operation stemmed from an appeal to a former member of Israel's domestic intelligence agency, Shin Bet, by a former member of the sect, Yisrael Amir.Mr Amir fled the group's base in Guatemala in 2020, having to leave his then one-year-old son there.His son was released in the raid last week and flown back to Israel with his father.The group had lived in Guatemala since 2014, but in January members illegally crossed into Mexico, settling in the jungle. The leadership in Guatemala has been at the centre of a kidnapping case since 2018. Nine of the sect's members have been charged, four of whom have so far been convicted. Lev Tahor - Hebrew for Pure of Heart - was formed in Israel in 1988 and is thought to number up to 350 members, according to an ex-members group.It has been forced to move from country to country in recent years after coming under scrutiny from local authorities. It is currently spread between Israel, the US, North Macedonia, Morocco, Mexico and Guatemala. Between 70 and 80 members are still in Guatemala.While the group is often described as ultra-Orthodox, it follows its own sets of rules and has been declared a "dangerous cult" by an Israeli court.Its leaders have denied breaking local laws and say the group is being targeted because of its beliefs.</Text></Article><Article author="BBC News"><Text>The European Union has agreed to impose emergency measures to charge energy firms on their record profits.Ministers have agreed windfall taxes on certain energy companies as well as mandatory cuts in electricity use.The plan includes a levy on fossil fuel firms' surplus profits and a levy on excess revenues made from surging electricity costs. The cash raised is expected to go to families and businesses.But the bloc is divided on whether and how to cap the wholesale price of gas.It comes as Europe braces itself for a difficult winter due to the cost of living crisis and squeeze on global energy supplies.What is the windfall tax on oil and gas companies?Germany vows €65bn package to combat energy crisisThe bloc is largely trying to wean itself off Russia energy but it has left it scrambling for other alternative, expensive, sources.A windfall tax is imposed by a government on a company to target firms that were lucky enough to benefit from something they were not responsible for - in other words, a windfall profit. Energy firms are getting much more money for their oil and gas than they were last year, partly because demand has increased as the world emerges from the pandemic and more recently because of supply concerns due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.EU ministers estimate that they can raise €140bn (£123bn) from the levies on non-gas electricity producers and suppliers that are making larger-than-usual profits from the current demand.Earlier this month, the European Commission's vice-president, Frans Timmermans, said that fossil fuel extractors will be told to give back 33% of their surplus profits for this year. "The era of cheap fossil fuels is over. And the faster we move to cheap, clean and homegrown renewables, the sooner we will be immune to Russia's energy blackmail," he said."A cap on outsize revenues will bring solidarity from energy companies with abnormally high profits towards their struggling customers," he added. Earlier this week, 15 member states, including France and Italy, asked the EU to impose a price cap on gas bills to slow the soaring costs. A decision has not yet been announced on a price cap. "There is big disappointment that in the proposal that is on the table there is nothing about gas prices," Polish climate minister Anna Moskwa said.Ms Moskwa said a maximum price for gas would be supported by the majority of European countries and "cannot be ignored". In the UK, former Chancellor Rishi Sunak introduced a similar tax to Friday's EU agreement in May, which he called the Energy Profits Levy.It was applied to profits made by companies from extracting UK oil and gas, but not those that generate electricity from sources such as nuclear or wind power. </Text></Article><Article author="BBC News"><Text>A suicide attack at a tuition centre in the Afghan capital Kabul has killed at least 19 people, most of them female students, police and witnesses say.Nearly 30 others were wounded at the Kaaj education centre in the Dasht-e-Barchi area in the west of the city.Students had been sitting a practice university exam when the bomber struck. No group has yet claimed the attack.Many of those in the area are minority Hazaras, who have often been targeted by Islamic State (IS) militants.Footage on local TV and shared on social media appeared to show scenes from a nearby hospital, where rows of covered bodies were laid out on the floor. Other media reportedly from the site of the private college showed rubble and upturned tables in the damaged classrooms."We didn't find her here," a woman who was looking for her sister at one of the hospitals told AFP news agency. "She was 19 years old." Some reports say the number of dead is far higher than Taliban officials have acknowledged. The attacker is reported to have shot at the guards outside the centre, entered a classroom and detonated a bomb.Eyewitnesses told the BBC that most of the victims were girls - they were seated in the front row, near the blast. A student who was wounded told AFP that there were around 600 people in the room when the attack happened. The Kaaj tuition centre is a private college which teaches both male and female students. Most girls' schools in the country have been closed since the Taliban returned to power in August last year, but some private schools are open.Hazaras, most of whom are Shia Muslims, are Afghanistan's third largest ethnic group. They have long faced persecution from the regional affiliate of Islamic State (ISKP) and the Taliban, which both adhere to Sunni Islam. The pupils too afraid to return to schoolSunnis and Shia: Islam's ancient schismThe secret girls school defying the TalibanOn Friday the Taliban's interior ministry spokesman said security teams were at the site and condemned the attack.Abdul Nafy Takor said attacking civilian targets "proves the enemy's inhuman cruelty and lack of moral standards". The attack was also strongly condemned by the United Nations and the US. "Targeting a room full of students taking exams is shameful; all students should be able to pursue an education in peace and without fear," said Karen Decker, charge d'affaires at the US mission to Afghanistan, in a tweet. The security situation in Afghanistan, which had improved after the end of fighting following the Taliban takeover, has been deteriorating in recent months, with a number of attacks on civilians but also Taliban supporters. Some have been claimed by IS, which is a bitter rival of the Taliban.Schools and hospitals have been targeted in the Dasht-e-Barchi area in a series of attacks, most of which are thought to have been the work of IS.Last year - before the Taliban returned to power - a bomb attack on a girls school in Dasht-e-Barchi killed at least 85 people, mainly students, and wounded hundreds more.</Text></Article><Article author="By Flora Drury"><Text>A rights group has called on Fifa to ban Iran from this year's World Cup after blocking women from watching games in their own country.Open Stadiums questioned why the country was being allowed to compete while "Iranian women remain locked out of our 'Beautiful Game'" by officials.The call comes weeks after women were allowed to attend a domestic match for the first time since 1979.However, the rights group was sceptical stadiums would remain open to women."Iranian women trust neither the Islamic Republic's authorities nor the Iranian Football Federation that the Azadi stadium will remain open to them after the Fifa World Cup 2022 concludes on December 18," Open Stadiums said in an open letter to Fifa's president, Gianni Infantino.It also argues that even those who travel to Qatar to watch matches risk falling foul of Iranian authorities, with fears state spies may keep tabs on those who attend.Prohibiting women from games goes against international football rules, the letter points out, arguing Fifa should "immediately expel Iran from the World Cup 2022 in Qatar" as a result.What happens when sport and politics collide in IranIranian news sites reported speculation that women were allowed to attend the match in August after Fifa sent a letter to authorities calling on them to permit more women into stadiums. Fifa has previously told the BBC it would not "turn its eyes" away from the issue.There is no official ban on women going to sporting events in Iran, but it is rare as they are often refused entry.Prior to this, women had effectively been barred from domestic matches where men are playing due to clerical disapproval under the Shia Muslim regime. Women have attended a handful of international matches, including one in March this year, news agency Reuters reports.The rights group, which campaigns for equal access to sport in Iran, also claimed in the letter that members of the football team going to Qatar later this year had been banned from speaking out over deadly protests currently rocking the country. They were sparked by the death in custody of a young woman, Mahsa Amini, after she was detained morality police.The letter points out that the detention centre where she died is the same one "where female fans are usually brought to and tortured if we dare to try to attend a football game".Neither the Iranian football association or Fifa have responded to a request for comment from Reuters.</Text></Article><Article author="By Christy Cooney"><Text>Comedian Trevor Noah has announced he is standing down as host of The Daily Show. Noah said he was "filled with gratitude for the journey" but that there was "another part of my life that I want to carry on exploring".The 38-year-old has hosted the satirical news and talk show since taking over from Jon Stewart in 2015. He said the timing of his departure would be announced later and that he would continue as host in the meantime. Noah began his career in his native South Africa, releasing a string of stand-up specials and hosting a late-night talk show before relocating to the US in 2011. He was still a relative unknown when he was chosen to take over the Daily Show on the Comedy Central network, but has since become an internationally-recognised star and won numerous television awards. Noah made the announcement at the end of his show on Thursday night, prompting shocked gasps from the studio audience.He thanked the show's crew and loyal fans for an "amazing seven years", adding: "It's been wild, truly wild". "I remember when we first started... so many people didn't believed in us," he said. "[Appointing me as host] was a crazy bet to make. I still think it was a crazy choice, this random African. "I just [find] myself filled with gratitude for the journey. It's been absolutely amazing. It's something that I never expected."The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterHe said that after everything that has happened during his time hosting the show - including Donald Trump's presidency and the Covid pandemic - he had decided his "time is up, but in the most beautiful way". "I've loved hosting this show, it's been one of my greatest challenges, it's been one of my greatest joys. But after seven years, I feel like it's time," he said. "I realised there's another part of my life that I want to carry on exploring. I miss learning other languages, I miss going to other countries and putting on shows. I miss just being everywhere and doing everything."I'm really grateful to a network who believed in this random comedian nobody knew on this side of the world."I never dreamed that I would be here. I sort of felt like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. I came in for a tour of what the previous show was, and then the next thing I know I was handed the keys."All I can say is thank you very much."</Text></Article><Article author="By James Waterhouse"><Text>Every day, convoys of people arrive in a supermarket car park in Zaporizhzhia city, escorted in by police vehicles. They've made the hazardous trip out of Russian-occupied territory in southern Ukraine, finally reaching the relative safety of this regional capital still firmly under Ukrainian control.And yet this is one of four Ukrainian regions that Russia is formally annexing, after a five-day exercise it called a referendum and Ukraine and the West condemned as a sham.Among those handing their papers to police is Anton Osenev, who says the Russians tried to mobilise him twice to fight against his own country, around his home city of Melitopol. "We weren't home for the first attempt," he says. "On the second occasion they stayed at our house for some time". Had it not been for his pregnant wife being in the room, they would have taken him, he believes. His father is in the Ukrainian army, and if he had been seized he would have been on the opposite side."I still don't understand what's happening, we need some rest."Few here care about Moscow's declaration of annexation.  What they are afraid of is what the occupiers will do now to defend what they've taken - whether that is being forced to fight for Russia, or Moscow resorting to more lethal weapons.Last week Vladimir Putin threatened to use all resources at his disposal, even nuclear weapons.For the Kremlin, that's the very point - to create uncertainty over what comes next.As you drive south towards the front line from Zaporizhzhia city, the roads seem to empty.Fewer people walk along the roadside. A car or military vehicle occasionally speeds by. You don't go for leisurely drives around here.What you do get more of are military checkpoints. Ukrainian forces use them to control who gets through, and work out who is coming from the direction of Russian-occupied territory. After our military escort gets us through, we're met with an open, straight road.Half an hour later we arrive at the village of Komyshuvakha, a small settlement in the Ukrainian outback.A handful of damaged buildings hug a wide, straight highway. Most windows are boarded up. On this autumnal afternoon it's almost silent. If we carried on driving for 11 miles, we'd encounter a Russian checkpoint. An area Moscow now sees as its new "border" with Ukraine. Despite the region's capital staying under Ukrainian control, Russian forces control most of the Zaporizhzhia region. Today's annexation announcement is a continuation of their attempts to make their presence seem just. For those we meet in Komyshuvakha, nothing seems fair.One of them is Liubov Smyrnova. She tearfully takes us to a burnt-out shell which was once her home. It was hit by a missile in May. She's only just felt able to return. "I think that Putin's politics is to destroy us, it's a genocide of our people," she tells me, while sifting through fragments of shrapnel. "We are under constant pressure. I can't even describe it with words. Komyshuvakha is shelled almost every day."Most people are inside because strikes tend to happen in the middle of the day, we're told. For now, the sound of birdsong and the occasional bark of a dog masks what has happened to this small community. It dawns on you that it's mostly women left here. The men of Komyshuvakha are mostly fighting, or just elsewhere.Around the corner, we speak to three women outside the building they've lived in for 70 years. Their eyes moisten as the strain of life here bubbles to the surface. "Winter is coming and there's not a single window in the house," they explain, often talking over each other. "It's like we're sitting on a powder keg." So, what do they make of Russia's claim to half of the region they live in?"There should be a free and independent Ukraine," they say. "We didn't attack anyone, didn't hurt anyone, and didn't want anything. We want to live the way we did before."Behind a fire escape door in an empty kindergarten, there's activity. Through it are three women busily washing potatoes and cooking pancakes. They don't know who they're cooking for, they say, just that the Ukrainian military instructs them to. As she stirs batter in a large bowl, I ask Anzhela whether she cares that Russia now sees her village as being close to its new "border"."We don't want that," she says. "We want to live the way we lived. Everything was fine, everything was all right." She whisks with a bit more vigour. "We grew up this way. Our children grew up this way and our grandchildren too." </Text></Article><Article author="By Tiffanie Turnbull"><Text>Australia has said it will end mandatory Covid isolation requirements from next month.Currently anyone who tests positive to the virus must isolate for five days, but that will end from 14 October.At times nicknamed "Fortress Australia", the country has had some of the strictest restrictions in the world since the pandemic began. Australia's chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, said the "emergency phase" of its response was probably over. But Prof Kelly said the decision "does not in any way suggest that the pandemic is finished".Mandatory isolation had been one of the few restrictions remaining. Australia continues to record about 5,500 virus cases each day, official figures show. It is one of the world's most vaccinated countries.Prof Kelly said the country would see "future peaks" of the virus, but it currently had "very low" numbers of hospital admissions and aged-care outbreaks.The Australian Medical Association opposes the change, saying those who pushed for it are not "scientifically literate" and are putting lives at risk.About 15,000 people have died with the virus in Australia - fewer than many nations. The vast majority have happened this year after the country opened up. Australia had closed international borders for around two years and imposed strict limits on movement around the country.Australia revisited - a country changed by CovidIs Australia still a Covid success story? Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said most existing governments payments for people who have to miss work because of Covid would also be scrapped."It was always envisaged that these measures were emergency measures," he said.Casual workers and those in high-risk areas like aged care or health will still be able to get financial support.</Text></Article><Article author="By Frances Mao"><Text>Women working at Australia's research camps in Antarctica have endured widespread sexual harassment, a report has found.It described evidence of uninvited touching, requests for sex, and a predatory culture which condoned pornography on walls and sexual taunts.Woman also felt they had to hide their menstruation, and ration tampons and pads because they were so limited.Officials have condemned the findings and vowed to bring on cultural change.Australia's Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek said she was "gobsmacked" by the independent review of Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) sites. It was instigated after individuals made complaints."As a minister, I take a zero-tolerance response to sexual harassment in any workplace I am responsible for," Ms Plibersek told the Australian Broadcasting Corp (ABC).Australia's Antarctic sites are located on the continent's eastern edge, and include the Casey, Davis and Mawson research stations. During the summer up to 500 expeditioners can be dispatched there, but during winter months the camps are reduced to about 15-30 key workers. Those workers - including doctors, chefs, and field officers - typically spend a year living at a station.Women in the camps felt like they couldn't escape or get immediate help due to the remote and isolated environment, said the report's author Meredith Nash, a professor at the Australian National University.They "have to work in the fields with their abusers for weeks at a time because they simply can't leave", she told the ABC, which first reported the findings on Friday."Or, because of the power dynamics, they are not in a position to make a complaint or get support immediately as they would do back home," she added.Sex harassment rife in Australia parliament - reportThe long-lasting effects of workplace sexual harassmentThe report also found a homophobic culture among the male-dominated field, and said people feared speaking out because they didn't want to be excluded from future expeditions.In such a masculine environment, women scientists felt pressure to hide their periods out of fear of male judgement, the review said.Women also had to "go through a gatekeeper to access free menstrual products" with a voucher request system, reflecting a lack of adequate support in basic camp infrastructure. AAD Director Kim Ellis said they were already putting in place the report's recommendations."I am deeply concerned by the experiences described at our workplaces where people have been sexually harassed, discriminated against and excluded," he said.</Text></Article><Article author="By Malu Cursino"><Text>Morocco's culture ministry has accused Adidas of appropriating Moroccan culture in its new jerseys for Algeria's football team.Adidas said the design was inspired by the Mechouar Palace in Algeria.However the geometric blue, teal and yellow design is a pattern called zellige, which is common in Moroccan mosaics, the ministry's lawyer said.The neighbouring nations have a long history of tensions, as they continue to dispute Western Sahara. Lawyer Mourad Elajouti wrote on Facebook that he had issued a legal warning to Adidas, on behalf of Morocco's Ministry of Culture.In a letter to the company's chief executive Kasper Rorsted, Mr Elajouti said the new design was cultural appropriation and "an attempt to steal a form of Moroccan cultural heritage and use it outside its context".He has demanded the German sportswear brand remove the design within two weeks.Mr Elajouti added that Algeria's 2022-2023 season kit "contributes to the loss and distortion of the identity and history of these [zellige] cultural elements".The BBC has contacted Adidas for comment.Algeria and Morocco share a nearly 2,000 km (1,242 miles) border, which has been a source of tension since independence from French colonial rule.In 1963, they had the Sand War over Morocco's claim to territory in Algeria. Drugs, dates and disputes at mules' border crossingLater on, Algeria backed the Polisario Front's campaign for Western Sahara's independence from Morocco, leading to the 1975-1991 Western Sahara War.The border was then closed in 1994 for security reasons after militant Islamists bombed a hotel in the historic Moroccan city of Marrakesh.More recently, in 2021 Algeria cut diplomatic ties with its neighbour, accusing Morocco of "hostile acts". Morocco called the move "completely unjustified".</Text></Article><Article author="By Jonathan Josephs"><Text>The US has said it "seems" Russia is to blame for this week's leaks in the Nord Stream gas pipelines.US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm told the BBC an investigation was being carried out into the cause of what she called "an act of sabotage", adding "it is highly unlikely that these incidents are coincidence"No evidence about how the leaks happened has been made public.Russia has dismissed suggestions that it was to blame.It said claims it had damaged the pipelines were "stupid and absurd".Sweden finds new leak in Russian gas pipeline    EU ramps up pipeline security after mystery attacksHow can the world cope without Russian oil and gas?President Putin described the damage as "unprecedented sabotage, in fact, an act of international terrorism" during a phone call with Turkey's President Erdogan, according to the Kremlin, which added Russia plans to bring it up for "urgent discussion" at the UN Security Council.Earlier Russia's Foreign Ministry suggest it was the US that stood to benefit from the pipeline being out of action because it would be able to increase its own natural gas sales.The White House has dismissed such suggestions."It's probably most likely some form of sabotage," according to Mike Fulwood of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies."If there was one incident of a pipeline rupture of leak then accidental damage could be a possibility, it is very rare."The most likely cause of accidental damage is an anchor being dropped and dragging across the pipeline".He added that with multiple leaks in a short period of time "doesn't sound like it could be accidental, although theoretically it could be".The high water pressure at the bottom of sea makes a detonation difficult, according to energy engineering expert Professor Russell Johns of Penn State University. He says "it is not likely that the Russians detonated their own pipeline. They could have simply cut-off gas to the pipeline entrance" if they wanted to stop supplies.The money Russia continues to receive for its fossil fuels is helping fund its invasion of Ukraine. The gas escaping from the pipeline near the Danish island of Bornholm has been in the pipe since the beginning of September when Moscow closed it off, saying repairs were needed to a vital artery in supplying Europe's energy needs. Ms Granholm suggested the energy relationship between Russia and Europe was being consigned to history."I think Russia has proven itself to be an unreliable energy partner," she said."No country wants to take the risk of putting a significant amount of its energy demand to Russia's supply. I think this accelerates the EU's push to become energy independent through clean energy".The war in Ukraine has had a profound impact in pushing up global energy prices. They've been the biggest contributor to soaring inflation in the UK, Eurozone and US, something which is threatening to reduce global economic growth.The increasing cost of living has made political leaders around the world re-evaluate where they get their energy from, according to Ms Granholm, who was speaking from the International Atomic Energy Agency's Ministerial Conference in Vienna."Every country is looking at the risks associated with putting too many eggs in one basket or putting too many eggs in the basket of petro-dictators and the volatility of the fossil fuels that accrue from that. Everyone is looking to how they can become energy independent."Wind, solar and nuclear energy are among the alternatives many countries are trying to increase as they also aim to meet the Paris climate change targets.However an analysis by Columbia University suggests that Russia has a 46% share of global enrichment capacity for nuclear fuel, and the International Energy Agency warned in July that China has an 80% share "in all the key manufacturing stages of solar panels".When asked how the US and others don't end up overly reliant on such alternatives Ms Granholm replied that "this move to clean energy could be part of a great peace plan" and that such a move "helps people's pocketbooks, helps the economy, and helps energy security".This year's steep increases in the price of oil and gas have benefitted the energy giants who get them to consumers. In the first half of this year the combined profit of five of the biggest western energy firms, BP, Shell, Total, Chevron and Exxon almost tripled to just over $95.2bn with much of it going to shareholders.Ms Granholm said President Biden's administration wanted to see such companies lower prices at petrol pumps "so that citizens are not hurting".Despite acknowledging that oil is traded on a free market she called on them to help, "at least the American companies as good American citizens" and warned they could face a windfall tax similar to what has been seen in the UK."We don't want that huge amount of profit to end up triggering consequences, either Congressionally or elsewhere, that will not be in their interest."We want them to be responsible and not be buying back shares instead of increasing production, production that would ultimately reduce prices because of increasing supply. We are looking at legislative tools as well as otherwise pressuring them."One other way the US could help increase the supply of oil to global markets is by lifting some of the sanctions imposed on Venezuela by President Trump.The South American country has the world's largest oil reserves but has been exporting minimal amounts of oil because of the restrictions. They were enacted because of alleged corruption and the political fallout from 2019's contested election. An increase in supplies would be likely to push down global oil prices. When asked if it was time to lift the sanctions, Ms Granholm didn't dismiss the idea, replying: "I'm not going to get ahead of the White House on that."You can watch Jennifer Granholm's interview in full on Talking Business with Aaron Heslehurst this weekend.Viewers in the UK can watch the show at 15:30 on the BBC News Channel, and afterwards on BBC iPlayer.In other countries, it will be on BBC World News on Saturday at 23:30 GMT, Sunday at 05:30 and 16:30 GMT and Monday at 16:30 GMT.</Text></Article><Article author="BBC News"><Text>A US army major doctor and her wife, a civilian doctor, have been charged with a plot to leak information to the Russian government. Jamie Lee Henry and Anna Gabrielian are accused of planning to share confidential information about patients at a military hospital. The pair allegedly told an undercover FBI agent that they were motivated by patriotism for Russia. Representatives of the couple have not yet commented on the case.There has been no comment from Russian authorities, either. The pair were charged with conspiracy and the disclosure of identifiable health information, in an indictment filed in a court in Baltimore, Maryland which was unsealed on Thursday after their arrest. Prosecutors said the couple wanted to help the Russian government "gain insights into the medical conditions of individuals associated with the US government and military".The indictment states that Maj Henry, 39, planned to use her security clearance to gain access to private medical records from the hospital at Fort Bragg, the large military base where she worked. Dr Gabrielian, 36, is accused of planning to share information from where she worked, believed to be Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. She allegedly offered help to the Russian embassy in Washington several months ago, after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In mid-August she was approached by a person claiming to work for the Russian embassy, who was in reality an FBI agent. During the meeting, the indictment says she told the agent that "she was motivated by patriotism toward Russia to provide any assistance she could to Russia, even if it meant being fired or going to jail".She is accused of offering to bring her wife into the plot, and telling the agent that she had access to medical information at the base and insight on how the US was training the military to provide assistance to Ukraine. At another meeting later on the same day, Maj Henry allegedly told the agent that she was also committed to Russia, and considered volunteering to join the Russian army. She apparently said she had reservations about violating the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which is what the couple have been charged with. But Dr Gabrielian allegedly had no such concerns, and handed over some information later in August. The indictment suggests the couple planned to hand over the medical records in order to prove their willingness to help the Russians, and their level of access to secret information. Dr Gabrielian is also accused of telling the agent that her wife could share information about how the US military establishes army hospitals in war conditions, and previous training given by the US to the Ukrainian military.

The incubation period can last from two days to three weeks. Ebola can be associated with other illnesses such as malaria and typhoid.The fact that it was three weeks before the first case was detected on 20 September has caused concern.Ebola spreads between humans by direct contact with bodily fluids and contaminated environments. Funerals can be a particular risk if mourners have direct contact with the body.Most of the 31 cases identified are in Uganda's central district of Mubende, of whom six people have died.However, the death toll may be higher. The health ministry says there were 18 deaths, linked to confirmed cases, where burials took place before they could be tested.The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates the fatality rate is between 41% and 100%.Another concern is that this is the Sudan strain of Ebola, for which there is no approved vaccine, unlike the more common Zaire strain. This means there has been no vaccination of health workers, who account for six of the confirmed cases.The Zaire strain was responsible for the largest ever outbreak of Ebola, in West Africa from December 2013 to 2016. More than 11,000 people died.With more than 28,000 cases in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, scientists carried out intensive research into Ebola vaccines.Two years after that epidemic ended, the then unlicensed Ervebo vaccine, developed by Merck, was used during an outbreak of the Zaire strain in the west of the Democratic Republic of Congo. It was granted clearance by the WHO, which said it had limited infections and saved lives.A second vaccine by Johnson &amp; Johnson has since been approved for use by the European Medicines Agency. But neither of these vaccines has been tested against the Sudan strain.Nonetheless Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni said his government was exploring whether it was worth trying them.The focus is on contact tracing - finding those who have been in close proximity with patients, especially those who attended the community funerals.A 51-bed treatment facility is operational in Mubende district, the epicentre of the outbreak. A second facility is due to be set up soon.President Museveni said two mobile laboratories would be sent to Mubende by Friday, so that people would not have to travel for tests and risk spreading the virus.Medics have expressed concern about the lack of adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves and masks. They have also called for the affected region to be put under quarantine. However, President Museveni ruled out restrictions, saying: "Ebola is not spread like corona[virus]" as it is not an airborne disease.He said markets, schools and places of worship would remain open, but urged people to observe personal hygiene and avoid close contact. Ebola jumps to humans from infected animals, such as chimpanzees, fruit bats and forest antelope. Bushmeat - wild forest animals hunted for human consumption - is thought to be the natural reservoir of the virus.It then spreads between humans by direct contact with contaminated bodily fluids - blood, saliva, vomit, semen, vaginal discharge, urine, faeces and sweat.Men who have recovered from Ebola have also been found to harbour the virus in their semen for a period after recovery. To prevent infection, health professionals advise avoiding contact with cases, including stopping shaking hands, washing hands with soap and water and cleaning surfaces with chlorinated water.It is also important to isolate cases and their contacts. Countries usually set up holding centres for suspected cases and treatment centres for laboratory-confirmed cases.In eastern DR Congo, which borders Uganda, survivors of Ebola played a key role in providing care for infected patients as it has been established that they cannot be re-infected. However, medical teams must wear full PPE when attending to cases to prevent infection. Bodies, in a body bag, must be buried by those wearing proper PPE. More recent innovations have included having body bags with clear covers around the face to enable families to view the body safely before burial. </Text></Article><Article author="By Jessica Murphy"><Text> In recent years Canada has worked to advance reconciliation with indigenous people in the country. What does the accession of a new King of Canada mean for that process? Earlier this year, at a reception in Canada's national capital, King Charles - at the time the Prince of Wales - was asked for an apology. The request came from Assembly of First Nations National Chief RoseAnne Archibald, who told him that the Crown needs to make amends for the "assimilation and genocide" of indigenous schoolchildren at residential schools run by the Anglican Church - of which Charles is now the head - and for its role in colonisation. The three-day visit was Charles's nineteenth official tour in the country, and his last as the Prince of Wales.Charles did not apologise on the trip, though he spoke of the need to "come to terms with the darker and more difficult aspects" of history.But some are hopeful that the new King's accession will be the beginning of a more positive relationship between the Crown and indigenous peoples in Canada.Around the world, Commonwealth nations, including Canada, are grappling with what the role of the monarchy following Queen Elizabeth's death, and what her son, Charles, should do to make amends for colonialism.  In Canada, the King's accession comes amid a national conversation about reconciliation with indigenous peoples. It is a conversation that has been building for years, but came to the forefront last summer as First Nations came forward with evidence of the discovery of unmarked graves on the sites of former residential schools - government-funded institutions established in the 1800s that were part of a former policy to assimilate indigenous children.For Canada, reconciliation is multi-faceted. In addition to a royal apology, many have called on the Crown to return indigenous artefacts that were removed and taken to Britain, and to play a more active role in honouring historic treaty relationships between the monarchy and indigenous people.These treaties are constitutionally recognised agreements that define the rights and responsibilities between indigenous groups and federal and provincial governments. Treaties with the Crown date back to the 1700s, and negotiating modern treaties is seen as an important part of reconciliation. Cree writer and former treaty negotiator Darrel J McLeod argued in Canada's Globe and Mail newspaper earlier this month that Queen Elizabeth failed to use the resources available to her to make amends for things done in the Crown's name - from issuing formal apology to the repatriation of indigenous artefacts.He said he hoped the King will "have the insight and determination to accomplish what his mother wasn't able to and use whatever time that might remain for the Windsor dynasty's role in Canada to turn things around". The child graves behind Canada's national reckoningWATCH: Canada 'Sixties Scoop' - Indigenous survivors map out their storiesCanada was a monarchy even before it was a country. Over 500 years ago, both French and British monarchs presided over colonies in Canada. The connection between the Crown and indigenous peoples dates back even further, to when Europeans first set foot on the continent.To this day, symbols of treaties signed in the 1800s with the Crown can be seen on the prairies. When they were signed, 'treaty medals', which acknowledged promises made by the Crown, were handed out. "It had the Queen's image on one side, and that was given to every chief who signed the treaty," noted Doug Cuthand, a Canadian columnist and member of the Little Pine First Nation in the province of Saskatchewan. "And every chief who signs a treaty was given a Union Jack, because Canada didn't have a flag at that time."Although now it is the federal government, and not the Royal Family, that has the power to administer these agreements, the Crown still has a symbolic relationship with indigenous people. Union Jacks are still a common sight at First Nations gatherings across those provinces, signifying the importance of those agreements, said Mr Cuthand. Canada's Governor General Mary Simon is the representative of the Crown in Canada, one of 15 countries where the King continues to operate as head of state. An Inuk woman - and the first indigenous person in the role - she recalled how as a child in the far north, portraits of the Queen hung in many homes."She was revered by communities, Inuit people in the Arctic," she told the BBC's Chief International Correspondent Lyse Doucet earlier this month.But there is anger directed at the monarchy as well. In Manitoba last year, statues of Queen Victoria and Queen Elizabeth were toppled during protests over the unmarked graves at residential school sites. There is a recognition by indigenous people of the damage that colonialism did to the First Nations, said Mr Cuthand, but also of the ties forged long ago."It's a bit of a dichotomy, isn't it?" he said. "There's that sort of high-level relationship that exists, but then there was the implementation of the treaties and of the colonialism that followed."Nathan Tidridge, vice-president of the Institute for the Study of the Crown in Canada, argues that when Canada became a country in 1867, it in many ways eclipsed that original relationship between monarchy and indigenous nations, placing political power and the treaties under the control of federal governments. Entrusted by the Crown to govern, they oversaw damaging policies like residential schooling.Still, many indigenous people in Canada say King Charles has an important role in reconciliation despite being limited to a symbolic role as head of state and expected to not meddle in Canadian political affairs.  "All signs point to an engaged King who is more competent on indigenous issues" than Queen Elizabeth was, said Niigaan Sinclair, professor of indigenous studies at the University of Manitoba. "We need a monarch that's going to intervene when they see injustice taking place," he said - one that's "going to care beyond just nice words.""We need a monarch that's going to have the ear of the prime minister and say 'these are the treaties that you must adhere to because the Crown has signed onto them.'"King Charles recently reiterated to the governor general that he was committed to reconciliation, and Mr Tidridge sees the potential for work to be done through the Crown's representatives like Ms Simon and her counterparts in Canada's provinces. Although he did not apologise on his recent visit, Mr Tidridge thinks that one day the King could come to Canada for the apology requested by Chief Archibald."You don't just come for a whistle-stop tour, and then issue an apology - this takes time," he said."The Crown is this old institution that sweeps up over a millennia of history. He is someone that recognises and understands that history," Mr Tidridge said of the new King."He could do things that I think that his mother couldn't do."</Text></Article><Article author="By Juliana Gragnani &amp; Jake Horton"><Text>Before a vote has been cast in Brazil's forthcoming election, current President Jair Bolsonaro is sowing doubts about how secure the country's voting system is. While campaigning, he has said that the voting machines used across Brazil are open to fraud, with echoes of Donald Trump's rhetoric around the 2020 US presidential election."The system is completely vulnerable," claims President Bolsonaro, without providing evidence. Voting is done electronically, as has been the case since 1996.Each candidate has a number, and on election day voters type the number of their chosen candidate into a voting machine at polling stations across the country. The votes are then counted by the machines, and the totals are sent electronically to a central office. Votes from across the country are tallied up and a final result is announced, usually within hours of polls closing. Each machine also prints out a paper copy of the totals for each candidate. When polls close they are displayed publicly at polling sites, and each machine's votes can be compared with the total recorded by the electoral court. This year, for the first time, these paper copies will be published online on the day of the vote.President Bolsonaro has said: "We cannot have dubious elections in 2022. Public counting of votes is needed." He's been making similar claims for years. After winning the 2018 presidential election in a run-off, he claimed voting fraud robbed him of an outright victory in the first round, which he won by a 17 point margin with 46% of the vote.Subsequent studies of the 2018 election didn't find any evidence of voting irregularities. Brazilians vote electronically, so there are no paper copies of individual ballots.This has been highlighted by President Bolsonaro as a security issue, and he has called for "printable and auditable" paper ballots to safeguard the electronic system."It's impossible to audit elections in Brazil," President Bolsonaro declared in July during a meeting with ambassadors.He says it is "easy to rig" electronic voting machines by altering their source code, the internal commands within a machine's software.It's not true to say you can't audit the vote in Brazil. The machines can retrieve votes cast for an electronic recount.Such an audit took place in the 2014 presidential election, which concluded that there was no foul play."There is no reasonable proof of fraud going on in the past, at least in big audits that have been done," says Prof Marcos Simplicio, who took part in the auditing of the 2014 election.The Supreme Electoral Court, the body that oversees Brazil's election, says the system has a series of procedures in place to secure the vote.For example, a number of voting machines are selected at random to be removed from polling sites for a test vote alongside the actual vote on election day.These are checked to be working correctly by entering test votes for each of the candidates in a process witnessed by party representatives. "The vote placed in the electronic ballot box is secured by several mechanisms. The software goes through several tests, including tests with experts and outside investigators who try to break its security," says Julio Valente, the Information Technology Secretary of Brazil's electoral court.Before each election the court invites researchers and software experts to look for vulnerabilities in the voting system. This year, more than 20 experts tried to penetrate the system but failed to do so.However, over the years experts have said improvements could be made."The security of the Brazilian election system relies heavily on the system's software, which has been the main point of criticism from the academic community since the 90s," says Prof Paulo Matias, a computer security specialist at the University of São Carlos. Brazil election: 'We'll vote for Bolsonaro because he is God'Lula: Can Brazil's 'most popular president' win again?Brazil election: Why it matters so much to the USPresident Bolsonaro has also claimed votes are counted in a "secret room" out of public view at the central electoral office. The votes are counted by computers that are located in a secure room but party representatives can monitor the process."The view of most of the technical community is that fraud is really hard in the current system. The system can be improved and should be, but that doesn't mean there's been fraud," says Prof Simplicio.Allegations that the system is unreliable have spread across social media - often in groups backing the president. Just a quarter of Bolsonaro supporters say they trust the electoral system "a lot", and almost a third don't trust it "at all" according to a recent survey.Videos containing misleading information from previous elections are used to cast doubt on the system.  Two videos that were spread following the 2018 election showed voters entering Bolsonaro's number and receiving the message "null vote". However, on the election day, Brazilians don't vote only for the president. They also cast votes for other political representatives, such as senators and governors, and use unique numbers to do so. A closer look at the two videos shows that Bolsonaro's number had been pressed when the voter was asked to choose a  governor. When there is no candidate with that number, a "null vote" message is displayed. Voters can still correct the mistake and press the right number before confirming their vote.Another video allegedly showed a man pressing Bolsonaro's number and the machine showing his rival's picture instead. At the time, the electoral court debunked the video, saying it had been edited. The video didn't show the voting machine buttons and screen at the same time, which meant different images could've been stitched together.Additional reporting by Mariana SanchesRead more from Reality CheckSend us your questions</Text></Article><Article author="By Laura Bicker"><Text>Santiago Matela was 22 when he was dragged off the street by soldiers while playing basketball. The year was 1977, five years since President Ferdinand E Marcos had declared martial law in the Philippines -  on 21 September 1972.Mr Marcos suspended parliament and arrested opposition leaders - Mr Matela was among the tens of thousands of people detained and tortured during a decade of martial law.  Fifty years on, he is no longer afraid to speak out. But he is afraid of not being believed at a time when the truth about one of the darkest periods in Filipino history is under attack. Mr Matela endured three months of torture, including being tied naked to a block of ice. His captors demanded he admit to being a communist. He says he didn't even know what that word meant."They kept on forcing me to confess that I was leading a rally and throwing grenades. They asked me the same questions again and again and beat me. They used a yantok - a cane - and they hit my body many times," he said. "Even my genitals were assaulted by the military just to make you confess what you should not be confessing."Some 70,000 people were imprisoned, 34,000 were tortured and over 3,200 people were killed in the nine years after Mr Marcos imposed martial law, according to Amnesty International.Meanwhile, the Marcos family lived famously opulent lifestyles. Mr Marcos' wife, Imelda Marcos, amassed a huge collection of art and other luxuries, including hundreds of pairs of shoes.They deny siphoning off billions of dollars of state wealth while at the helm of what historians consider one of Asia's most notorious kleptocracies. Public anger at abuse and corruption eventually led to pro-democracy protests in 1986 and the family were forced to flee to Hawaii where they lived in exile. Ferdinand Marcos died three years later.But earlier this year, his son and namesake, Ferdinand Marcos Jr - popularly known as "Bongbong" - led an extraordinary comeback and won the presidency in a landslide victory.What a Marcos revival means for the PhilippinesWhy the Marcos family is so infamous'Politicians hire me to spread fake stories'The Marcos rebranding is the result of a major social media operation, aimed at younger Filipinos born after martial law ended. The message seeded in snappy Facebook, YouTube and TikTok posts is that the family has been unfairly treated by the mainstream press.Mr Marcos Jr has shunned network news interviews and refused to participate in presidential debates. He has made it clear he doesn't want to discuss the past and has instead focused on a promise to unite the nation and help it recover from the crippling effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.This popular message, by a recognisable celebrity name, hit home with voters eager for change - including Mr Matela's children. Mr Matela tells me that his son believes the past should stay in the past, a view that he finds upsetting. "My son is adamantly on their side. He doesn't know that what I'm doing is all for them. These are my experiences and what I'm fighting for is for their sake too, so that they will know what happened. "You want me to just disregard what I went through? That cannot happen. The sufferings I went through are embedded in my mind," he said. "I'm still fighting because of my pain."The Marcos administration insists it has not engaged in disinformation. Gemma, a fact checker from the news website Rappler founded by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Maria Ressa, says the disinformation being propagated is difficult to quantify."It's not one single page, it's not one single account, it's not one single group. The point is that it's coming at you from various points. We've mapped tens of thousands of accounts and groups and pages. "Many look like official history pages and post content that triggers nostalgia but within that content you will find stories peddling an incorrect narrative."Among the most widely spread falsehoods are claims that no arrests were made under martial law."Many of the posts deny human rights abuses took place and claim that the only people incarcerated were rebels or criminals or troublemakers," Gemma said. The Marcos administration has not responded to the BBC's requests for an interview. Mr Marcos Jr has posted an interview on YouTube with his goddaughter where he denies that his father was a dictator.The Marcos family has never apologised, but more than 11,000 victims, including Mr Matela, have received reparations from the government.Their written accounts are logged in dozens of numbered cardboard boxes piled high in an archive at the Human Rights Violations Victims' Memorial Commission, an independent government body.In a new green room at the centre, a young team are creating their own snappy social media posts - with facts about martial law."You have to go where the young people are," says executive director Crisanto Carmelo. Fears the past is being rewritten have led to a push to preserve and digitise the detailed accounts of martial law abuse in the hope that they can be placed in a museum. One file recalls how a mother was handed back the body of her brutally tortured and murdered son. The account is too gruesome to detail here.But will Mr Marcos allow such a museum - one built to honour the victims of martial law - while he is president?"I am optimistic that he will be magnanimous in victory and serious in his intention to unify the country," Mr Carmelo said. "This is the year which marks the 50th year of the declaration of martial law which transformed our country and transformed the lives of many ordinary Filipinos. Many of them are now in their senior years, like me, so a museum is not for me, I lived through it. "A museum is for the younger generation - to say that this happened to our country and if we can come together, they can determine what type of country and system of government and rules of liberty and democracy they want for the future."Many young Filipinos are engaged. On a recent popular historical tour, young Filipinos played games to recreate the past.The idea is to help them pin down the facts and navigate away from a maze of martial law myths.The teams took selfies together - most of them had met only a few hours earlier. They planted flowers at the memorial with the names of those who died under martial law.Seventeen-year-old Hannah found the day emotional."They've lost their dreams, their lives and I wanted to recognise that. I want to go and tell my friends that in order for us to have the liberty and democracy we have today, these were people who sacrificed everything. They suffered a lot of violence and immoral wrongdoings, and they deserve to be recognised."It seems that voices from the past, however painful, are helping to keep this country's collective memory alive.</Text></Article><Article author="By Mark Savage"><Text>When Coolio first heard the demo that became Gangsta's Paradise, he had the same reaction as the rest of us."I was like, 'Damn, I really like this song.'"The Pennsylvania-born, Compton-raised rapper was at his manager's house in 1995 to pick up a cheque, when he noticed producer Doug Rasheed messing around with the song in another room."So I went to Doug said, 'Yo! What's this?'" "He said, 'It's just a song we're working on', "And immediately I said, 'It's mine'. Just like that. "I freestyled the whole first line, then I sat down, I picked up a pen and I started to write." Released in August 1995, and boosted by a memorable video starring Michelle Pfeiffer, the song immediately ruled the airwaves. Those lurching stings, the other-worldly choir, and that soaring hook, combined with Coolio's distinctive, confessional storytelling, made it an instant classic.It was the first "serious" rap song to top the UK and US charts, opening the door for acts like 2Pac and the Notorious B.I.G, who, until that point, had been considered too abrasive for the mainstream. And its appeal has never lessened. The biggest-selling single of 1995 in America, Gangsta's Paradise has now been streamed more than one billion times on both Spotify and YouTube. "I thought it was going to be a hood record," he told The Voice in 2017. "I never thought it would crossover the way that it did - to all ages, races, genres, countries and generations."And yet... Gangsta's Paradise faced several hurdles on its way to the top. Here's how it unfolded...Pfeiffer and Snoop lead tributes to rapper Coolio 'People thought Coolio in Castlederg was a hoax'Coolio was born Artis Leon Ivey, Jr in Pennsylvania, and moved to Compton in South Central LA as a boy. Suffering from chronic asthma, he became a bookworm and excelled at school."I lived in that library, man," he told Rolling Stone, while visiting his old neighbourhood in 1995. "I read every kid's book they had in there. I even read Judy Blume."That changed when he turned 11 and his parents divorced. Seeking a way to fit in, he fell into the gangster lifestyle and adopted a menacing, street-tough persona. A few years later, he was busted for bringing a weapon into school. Before he turned 20, he had served time behind bars for larceny.Later, Coolio studied at Compton Community College and discovered rap. He took his stage name, Coolio Iglesias, from Latin heartthrob from Julio Iglesias, and released a few singles on the local scene, but drug abuse derailed his career.In his 20s he moved to San Jose to live with his father, while working as a firefighter; and later credited Christianity for helping him overcome his addiction to crack.Still enamoured with rap, he made a guest appearance on WC and the Maad Circle's 1991 debut album, Ain't a Damn Thang Changed; then joined a collective called the 40 Thevz before signing a solo deal with Tommy Boy records - the influential label that played home to De La Soul, Naughty By Nature and House Of Pain.His first album, It Takes a Thief, arrived in 1994, and was praised for its combination of funky grooves and socially-conscious lyrics. The musician's message was exemplified by the "hilarious" video for Fantastic Voyage, said Source magazine."As the Lakeside groove carries you along, Coolio piles about six milion people into the trunk of his '64 and takes them to a magical land where race, poverty, gangs and sexual orientation don't matter and everybody was cool."Hip-hop's gatekeepers were not interested in such idealism. Ivey's anti-violence, pro-acceptance stance somehow made him "soft". He earned the unwelcome nickname "Un-Coolio".But then came Gangsta's Paradise.One day, Doug Rasheed pulled out his copy of Stevie Wonder's 1976 double-album Songs In The Key Of Life and cut a sample from Pastime Paradise, a bleak and anxious track that was one of the first songs to replace an orchestra with synthesized strings.Rasheed added a crunching beat and a menacing synth bass, then took the track to singer Larry "LV" Sanders, who laid down a vocal for the chorus."I came in singing 'Pastime Paradise,' but then I changed it up to 'Gangsta's Paradise,'" he told Rolling Stone for an oral history of the song in 2015. "I did my parts, all the vocals and the chorus, and I did the choir. That whole choir that you hear was actually me - I did all the parts from soprano down to tenor to the bass."LV wanted a rapper to appear on the track, and offered it to his friend Prodeje, who declined. Then Coolio overheard it.Mesmerised, he started writing lyrics straight away. The opening lyric, which riffs on Psalm 23, came to him instantly: "As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death/I take a look at my life and realise there's not much left.""I freestyled the whole first line, then I sat down, I picked up a pen and I started to write," he told the YouTube series Hot Ones in 2016."It was divine intervention. I was an instrument and the song was the entity. It wrote itself."Coolio was 30 at the time the song was written, but the narrator is 23 and he doesn't know if he'll live to see 24. He was "raised by the street", immersed a life of crime and retribution. If anyone crosses him, they'll end up "lined in chalk". But the story never glorifies the gangster lifestyle. The narrator prays every night, aware that he's trapped. In the final verse, he accuses the system of letting him down."They say I gotta learn, but nobody's here to teach me / If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?"It's a bleak story. One that could only have been told with the perspective Coolio gained from his teenage years. And the rapper bristled when his song was lumped in with the so-called "gangster rap" scene."I'm trying to get rid of that jacket that's been put on my back - that I'm a gangsta rapper," he said in 1995. "That's not my thing."My thing is to be true to myself and try to educate and entertain kids. When I make references [to the gangster lifestyle], I'm trying to get kids' attention using language they want to hear."Then I can take them to a deeper level. I'm just trying to get a better understanding of myself and a better understanding of other people."Gangsta's Paradise was a stark departure from the feel-good funk of Coolio's first album and, at first, his record label weren't sure what to make of it. "I called my A&amp;R at Tommy Boy Records, and I played it for him. He said, 'It sounds pretty good - I think it would make a good album cut.' Those were his exact words!"Incensed, the star's manager decided to shop the song around to movie studios. It nearly ended up on the soundtrack to the Will Smith film Bad Boys, but was eventually placed in the Disney movie Dangerous Minds - the true story of a former Marine who turns around a troubled inner-city high school by teaching them poetry and Bob Dylan lyrics.A lukewarm retread of Dead Poets Society, it was allegedly testing badly with audiences until Coolio's song started getting played on MTV. The video, like the film, starred Michelle Pfeiffer, who went face-to-face with Coolio as a camera spun around them."She was real nice," Coolio told Kiss FM's Rap show at the time. "She brought her son down to the shoot with her and she was cool. We had no problems."He was less enamoured with the movie itself, though."I hate those kinds of movies where, you know, the great white hope comes into the inner-city neighbourhood and saves the little children - 'Ooh la la, hey Santa Claus!' or whatever, all those kinds of things put it in play," he told Yahoo two years ago. "Those kinds of moments happen very few and far between. It's not that many people that care about each other [in real life]."According to Rolling Stone's oral history, the producers of Dangerous Minds, Coolio was paid $100,000 (£92,000) for Gangsta's Paradise. There was only one problem: Stevie Wonder hadn't cleared the sample."When Stevie heard it, he was like, "No, no way. I'm not letting my song be used in some gangster song,'" the star recalled. Luckily, Coolio's then-wife Josefa Salinas, knew Wonder's brother. "I guess he had been trying to tap that for years," he joked in the Rolling Stone article. "She made a call to him, got a meeting with Stevie and talked him into it. His only stipulation was that I had to take the curse words out."That edit undoubtedly changed Coolio's life. A profane version of Gangsta's Paradise would never have been played on pop radio, or entered heavy rotation on MTV. When it hit number one, it opened up new possibilities for hip-hop... although, to some, it marked the end of an era."America suddenly realised it could sell non-party rap to Brit panty-waists, and that's exactly what it's done ever since," wrote music journalist Garry Mulholland in his book This Is Uncool: The 500 Greatest Singles Since Punk And Disco."In many ways, Gangsta's Paradise signalled the end of gangsta, or 'reality' rap as a cult. It lost the allure of the forbidden when you mum started singing along."Coolio was ambivalent about the song too, often lamenting how its success overshadowed his other work."It's a blessing and a curse at the same time," he said. "For people that really like Gangsta's Paradise, that's all they really want to hear."In recent years, however, the musician came to appreciate the song's legacy, and his role in hip-hop history."People would kill to take my place," he said in 2018. "I'm sure after I'm long gone from this planet, and from this dimension, people will come back and study my body of work."Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

It stressed that payment details and account passwords were not compromised.Those whose passport or licence numbers were taken - roughly 2.8 million people - are at a "quite significant" risk of identity theft and fraud, the government has since said.Optus said it was investigating the breach and had notified police, financial institutions, and government regulators. The breach appears to have originated overseas, local media reported. In an emotional apology, Optus chief executive Kelly Bayer Rosmarin called it a "sophisticated attack", saying the company has very strong cybersecurity."Obviously, I am angry that there are people out there that want to do this to our customers, and I'm disappointed that we couldn't have prevented it," she said on Friday. Early on Saturday, an internet user published data samples on an online forum and demanded a ransom of $1m (A$1.5m; £938,000) in cryptocurrency from Optus.The company had a week to pay or the other stolen data would be sold off in batches, the person said.Investigators are yet to verify the user's claims, but some experts quickly said the sample data - which contained about 100 records - appeared legitimate.Sydney-based tech reporter Jeremy Kirk contacted the purported hacker and said the person gave him a detailed explanation of how they stole the data.The user contradicted Optus's claims the breach was "sophisticated", saying they pulled the data from a freely accessible software interface."No authenticate needed… All open to internet for any one to use," they said in a message, according to Kirk.In another escalation on Tuesday, the person claiming to be the hacker released 10,000 customer records and reiterated the ransom deadline.But just hours later, the user apologised - saying it had been a "mistake" - and deleted the previously posted data sets."Too many eyes. We will not sale [sic] data to anyone," they posted. "Deepest apology to Optus for this. Hope all goes well from this."That sparked speculation about whether Optus had paid the ransom - which the company denies - or whether the user had been spooked by the police investigation.Adding to the problem, others on the forum had copied the now-deleted data sets, and continued to distribute them.It also emerged some customers' Medicare details - government identification numbers that could provide access to medical records - had also been stolen, something Optus did not previously disclose. Late on Wednesday, the company said this had affected almost 37,000 Medicare cards.  Optus has been inundated with messages from angry customers since last week. People have been warned to watch out for signs of identity theft and for opportunistic scammers, who are said to be already cashing in on the confusion. A class-action lawsuit could soon be filed against the company. "This is potentially the most serious privacy breach in Australian history, both in terms of the number of affected people and the nature of the information disclosed," said Ben Zocco from Slater and Gordon Lawyers.The government has called the breach "unprecedented" and blamed Optus, saying it "effectively left the window open" for sensitive data to be stolen.In an ABC television interview on Monday, Cyber Security Minister Clare O'Neil was asked: "You certainly don't seem to be buying the line from Optus that this was a sophisticated attack?""Well, it wasn't. So no," Ms O'Neil replied. The moment drew lots of attention online. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterMs Bayer Rosmarin told News Corp Australia on Tuesday: "We have multiple layers of protection. So it is not the case of having some sort of completely exposed APIs [software interfaces] sitting out there."I think most customers understand that we are not the villains," she said, adding Optus could not say more while the investigation was ongoing.The company has faced calls to cover the costs of replacement passport and driving licences, as people scramble to protect themselves.The breach highlights how much Australia lags behind other parts of the world on privacy and cyber issues, Ms O'Neil says."We are probably a decade behind… where we ought to be," she told the ABC.Australia probes firms over customer 'faceprints' Australia's Nine TV network hit by cyber-attackBoth sides of politics have traded blame on the issue. Opposition MPs have said the Labor government is "asleep at the wheel", but the government points out it was only elected in May after a decade of conservative rule.Ms O'Neil pointed to two areas needing urgent reform.She argues the government should be able to better penalise companies like Optus. In some countries, the company would have faced hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties but Australia's fine is capped at about $2m, she said.She also wants to expand cyber-security laws that were introduced last year to include telecommunications companies."At the time, the telecommunications sector said: "Don't worry about us - we're really good at cybersecurity. We'll do it without being regulated. I would say that this incident really calls that assertion into question."Security experts have also suggested reforming data retention laws so telecommunication companies don't have to keep sensitive information for so long. Ex-customers should also have the right to request companies delete their data, experts say.Optus says it is required to keep identity data for six years under the current rules.Other industry figures have argued consumers should be able to take companies that lose control of their information to court, instead of the industry regulator.</Text></Article><Article author="By Katy Watson"><Text>In the second of two profiles of the leading candidates in the race to become Brazil's new president, Katy Watson asks if Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is the same person who took the world by storm 20 years ago.It is no coincidence that Lula chose the Amazon as one of his key destinations on the campaign trail. The 76-year-old's main rival in the presidential election on 2 October, far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, has been accused of destroying the rainforest. Lula knows that climate issues have soared to the top of the political agenda and in Manaus, the biggest city in the Amazon, he told reporters "the planet needs special attention from all of us"."We need to look after our forest, our fauna, our water, but most of all, we need to look after our people because they're struggling, they're in need and they need to live with dignity," he said. "We can reclaim this country, it's possible to once again walk with our heads held high."Lula chose the Museum of the Amazon to meet indigenous leaders and talk about the future of the forest. "Nobody wants to turn the Amazon into an untouchable world sanctuary," he told the audience. "What we want is to benefit from our wealth, our biodiversity." By saying that, the former president shows that he is aware of his rival's message. President Bolsonaro is at great pains to say that the rest of the world needs to stop meddling in Brazil's affairs.It is 20 years since Lula won the presidency for the first time. A former metal worker and union leader, he became a familiar face during the strikes of the 1970s, when workers called for higher wages, defying Brazil's military rulers.He came to power promising change. Helped by high commodity prices, he spent the windfalls on areas such as higher education and welfare programmes that contributed to lifting millions of Brazilians out of poverty. Described by former US President Barack Obama as "the most popular politician on Earth", Lula left office after eight years in power with an approval rating of more than 80%.Like him or hate him, he was a politician unlike any other. But in recent years, that legacy has been tainted with his party - and Lula himself - hit by corruption scandals. In 2017, he was sentenced to nine years in prison. His convictions were quashed four years later, but his brush with the law means that he is no longer just seen as the "saviour" of Brazil. Instead, many millions of Brazilians see him as a corrupt politician unfit for office.Given that split among voters, I asked him how he thought he could convince the electorate he is the right man to lead Brazil. "Deaths [like that] of Dom Phillips and Bruno Pereira can't ever happen again," he said, skirting the question with a reference to the killing in June of a British journalist and an indigenous expert in the Amazon."Brazil needs to be transformed into a civilised country, it can't fall victim to inhumane people," he added. "I am convinced that we need to change Brazil - and changing Brazil means having a government that assumes responsibility for really caring for people."Not far from the centre of Manaus, where Lula spoke, 24-year-old mother-of-three Carol Araújo lives in small community of palafitas - houses that sit on stilts over a small river.Rainy season is coming to an end and the earth below the houses here in the neighbourhood of São Jorge resembles a swamp more than a river.Rubbish is everywhere: broken bottles, old boxes and shoes. In the sweltering heat of Manaus, the stench is overpowering.  Official figures suggest an estimated 63 million people now live in poverty in Brazil, and Carol, who was born in São Jorge, is one of them. She knows nothing but hardship, but she does know who she is going to cast her ballot for. "I'm going to vote for Lula because under him, everything was easier," she says. "But I don't know if [by him] coming back things will improve." It is a risk she is prepared to take. With food and energy prices rising, she cannot make ends meet."I try and find work when it comes my way but it's hard. I have to make it work to feed my children." She says that it comes down to knowing who will help her and those like her, because "during the elections, all the politicians do is make promises".Lula more easily relies on the older generation, which can remember the good times, but he knows he will have to win over the younger generation voting for the first time. "It's a sign of the incapacity of Brazil's elite to renew itself," says Oliver Stuenkel, professor of international relations at the Getúlio Vargas Foundation in São Paulo. "Lula has been running for president since Brazil became a democracy in the late 1980s, and in that sense he is very much a key personality of Brazil's transition from autocracy to democracy. But he struggles to point to the future, he's very much a throwback."But while this is the same Lula, he will not be in charge of the same Brazil. Economic crises and more political polarisation set the country apart from what he inherited the first time.For supporter Beth Ferreira, that does not matter. "I am crazy about Lula - Brazil needs him because we are in decline," she says. "When he started in 2003, Brazil was in the same situation, it was devastated. And we think he can do the same thing - our hope never dies."</Text></Article><Article author="By David Gritten"><Text>Iran's supreme leader has blamed the US and Israel for the anti-government protests sweeping the country, in his first public comments on the unrest.Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said "riots" had been "engineered" by Iran's arch-enemies and their allies, and alleged that Qurans had been burned.He also called on security forces to be ready to deal with further unrest.The protests - the biggest challenge to his rule for a decade - were sparked by the death in custody of a woman.Mahsa Amini, 22, fell into a coma hours after being detained by morality police on 13 September in Tehran for allegedly breaking the strict law requiring women to cover their hair with a hijab, or headscarf. She died three days later.Her family has alleged that officers beat her head with a baton and banged her head against one of their vehicles. The police have said there is no evidence of any mistreatment and that she suffered "sudden heart failure".Women have led the protests that began after Ms Amini's funeral, waving their headscarves in the air or setting them on fire to chants of "Woman, life, freedom" and "Death to the dictator" - a reference to Ayatollah Khamenei.The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterAddressing a graduation ceremony of police and armed forces cadets on Monday, the supreme leader said Ms Amini's death "broke our hearts"."But what is not normal is that some people, without proof or an investigation, have made the streets dangerous, burned the Quran, removed hijabs from veiled women and set fire to mosques and cars," he added, without mentioning any specific incidents. The ayatollah, who has the final say on all state matters, asserted that foreign powers had planned "rioting" because they could not tolerate Iran "attaining strength in all spheres"."I say clearly that these riots and the insecurity were engineered by America and the occupying, false Zionist regime [Israel], as well as their paid agents, with the help of some traitorous Iranians abroad."He also gave his full backing to the security forces, saying that they had faced "injustice" during the unrest.Iran Human Rights, a Norway-based group, said on Sunday that at least 133 people had been killed by security forces so far. They include 41 protesters whom ethnic Baluch activists said had died in clashes in Zahedan on Friday.State media have reported that more than 40 people have been killed, including security personnel.Ayatollah Khamenei's comments came a day after security forces violently cracked down on a protest by students at Iran's most prestigious science and engineering university, reportedly arresting dozens.The BBC's Kasra Naji says the gunfire heard around the campus of Sharif University of Technology in Tehran on Sunday night spread fear among many Iranians that authorities had decided to make an example of the students.Security forces tried to the enter the campus, but the students drove them back and closed all the entrance gates.But, our correspondent adds, a siege developed and the students who tried to leave through an adjacent car park were picked up one by one and beaten, blindfolded and taken away.In one video posted on social media, a large number of people are seen running inside a car park while being pursued by men on motorbikes. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterThe siege was lifted later in the night following the intervention of professors and a government minister. On Monday, students at the university announced that they would not go back to classes until all of their fellow students had been released from detention. The university meanwhile said it had moved classes online, citing "the need to protect students".Protests were also reported at several other universities around the country. </Text></Article><Article author="By Valdya Baraputri and Raja Lumbanrau in Malang, Matt Murphy in London"><Text>Football fans "died in the arms" of players during a crush at Indonesia's Kanjuruhan stadium, the home team coach has said, as the number of children killed in the tragedy rose to 32.Javier Roca said the crush at the match in Java, in which 125 people lost their lives, left him "mentally shattered". Authorities say the youngest victim of Saturday's disaster was just three. Some 18 officers are being investigated after police fired tear gas at fans who invaded the pitch when the match ended.More than 320 other people were injured as supporters were trampled on and suffocated in crushes as they fled the gas. Indonesia's deputy minister of children and women affairs said the children were aged between three and 17. An eyewitness told the BBC that police had fired numerous gas rounds "continuously and fast" after the situation with fans became "tense". Home team Arema FC supporters ran onto the pitch when the match ended in a 3-2 defeat to their rivals Persebaya Surabaya.Videos on social media show fans clambering over fences to escape. Separate videos appeared to show lifeless bodies on the floor.One witness, Chandra, told the BBC that a sea of smoke in the stands caused instant panic among spectators. "Little kids were crying, women were fainting, screams were heard everywhere, all were flocking out," he said. Another fan, Eko, said he couldn't get out of the stand's exits due to the number of people trying to escape. "I went back to the top of the stands with friends. Then I used a scarf to keep the smoke away. After that I jumped into the field and went down through the side door," he said.Ester Andayanengtyas told the BBC her 17-year-old daughter Debora suffered serious injuries, including a broken neck and swelling on the brain during the panic. "I asked her not to watch the game that day. She didn't return home, in the morning her friends were looking for her," Ms Andayanengtyas said. "We looked for her in the ER, but she wasn't there. The hospital told us to look at the mortuary. The confusion happened because my daughter didn't carry an ID." Other witnesses reported hearing parents crying out "where is my child" among the chaos, and one man told the BBC that he saw parents collapsing while protecting their children. "A mother fainted while hugging her child, next to her the boy fainted," he said. "Then some supporters picked up the mother and the boy to get out of the stadium. They were carried away unconscious - maybe because of the tear gas."Muhamad Dipo Maulana, 21, who was at the match, told BBC Indonesian that after the game had ended a few Arema fans went on the pitch to remonstrate with the home team players but were immediately intercepted by police and "beaten".More spectators then took to the pitch in protest, the supporter said."Police with dogs, shields, and soldiers came forward," Mr Dipo told the BBC. He said he had heard more than 20 tear gas shots towards spectators at the stadium.Police spokesperson Dedi Prasetyo told reporters that the officers under investigation "were responsible for holding" the weapons and said they were being questioned by an internal affairs team. A police chief has now been sacked following the investigation.He added that several other officers, including the field security team, and some officials from the Indonesian football league, were also under investigation. Indonesia's human rights commission said it will conduct its own inquiry into the disaster, and President Joko Widodo has ordered that all matches in Indonesia's top league must be stopped until the official probe has been carried out. Amnesty International said the police response amounted to "use of excessive force by the state" to control an unarmed crowd, and protesters in the capital Jakarta on Sunday night carried placards that read "stop police brutality". Indonesia's police force has been previously criticised for its frequent use of tear gas in tightly-packed stadiums.Meanwhile, Mr Roca, the Arema FC coach, told the Spanish broadcaster Cadena Ser that he thought "the police overstepped their mark" in efforts to control the crowd. The announcement of the investigation comes after world football's governing body Fifa called the disaster "a dark day for all involved in football and a tragedy beyond comprehension". Fifa's own regulations say no "crowd control gas" should be carried or used by stewards or police at matches and the body has requested a report on the incident from the Indonesian football federation. Security Minister Mahfud MD wrote on Instagram that the stadium had been filled beyond capacity, with over 42,000 tickets being sold for the game in the 38,000 capacity stadium. "It had gotten anarchic. They started attacking officers, they damaged cars," said Nico Afinta, police chief in East Java, adding that two police officers were among the dead."We would like to convey that... not all of them were anarchic. Only about 3,000 who entered the pitch," he said.Fleeing fans "went out to one point at the exit. Then there was a build-up, in the process of accumulation there was shortness of breath, lack of oxygen", the officer added.</Text></Article><Article author="By Vanessa Buschschlüter"><Text>Brazil's election is going into a second round in which left-winger Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva will face far-right incumbent Jair Bolsonaro.With almost all the votes counted, Lula had won 48% against Bolsonaro's 43% - a much closer result than opinion polls had suggested.But Lula fell short of the more than 50% of valid votes needed to prevent a run-off. Voters now have four weeks to decide which of the two should lead Brazil.Winning outright in the first round was always going to be a tall order for any candidate - the last time it happened was 24 years ago.But President Bolsonaro and Lula had given their supporters hope that they could achieve just that.Both candidates can and will claim this as a victory, though. Lula has already said that this is a "mere delay" on his way to the presidency.For the 76-year-old former metal worker - who could not run in the 2018 election because he was in prison after being convicted on corruption charges which were later annulled - this spells a remarkable comeback.And President Bolsonaro, whom opinion polls had shown trailing far behind Lula, will rejoice in the fact that he proved the pollsters wrong, just as he had predicted he would. A race that is far from overWhy Brazil's election matters so much to the US'Our candidate isn't perfect, but he beats the alternative'This is a drama which has been years in the making. The two men are arch-rivals and spent much of the campaign trading insults.In the last TV debate before the vote, President Bolsonaro called Lula a thief, in reference to the corruption charges that put him in jail for 580 days before the conviction was annulled. Lula, who has always maintained that the charges against him were politically motivated, has labelled Mr Bolsonaro a madman.Not surprisingly, that tension has filtered down into the streets. During the nights before the vote, neighbours here in Rio could be heard shouting "Lula is a thief" and "Out with Bolsonaro" at each other.  Since the two candidates are such polar opposites, much is at stake.Lula says he will bolster measures to protect the Amazon rainforest, while Mr Bolsonaro has argued that parts of the rainforest should be opened up to economic exploitation.Deforestation and forest fires have soared during President Bolsonaro's time in office. Climate activists have warned that if he is re-elected, the area could reach a tipping point. Critics point out that Lula's environmental record during his time in office - he governed Brazil from 2003 to 2010 - was far from perfect.  But with Mr Bolsonaro counting on the agricultural sector and agribusiness for votes and support, it is Lula who is the preferred choice of climate activists. However, voters in Brazil have many other pressing concerns, such as rising food prices, which have contributed to an increase in poverty and hunger.Mr Bolsonaro acknowledged these concerns in a statement after the results were out. "I understand that a lot of the vote was down to the situation the Brazilian people are in. They are feeling the price rises, especially those of basic goods. I do understand that there's a desire for change but some change can be for the worse," he warned. Many voters also mentioned education and Brazil's high levels of inequality as issues they want the new president to tackle. Much of the campaign, however, was overshadowed by concern that Mr Bolsonaro may not accept defeat after he had said that "only God" could remove him from office. He had also cast doubts on Brazil's electronic voting system, alleging - without providing any evidence - that it was open to fraud. With the result much more favourable to him than predicted, he is now likely to concentrate more on how to sway those voters who cast their ballot for one of the other nine candidates who were eliminated in the first round.All eyes will now be on centrist Senator Simone Tebet, who came third in the election with 4%, and centre-left candidate Ciro Gomes, who came fourth with 3%. Both said that they would announce "in the coming days" who they would throw their weight behind for the run-off. Lula, who seems to thrive on overcoming obstacles, has already announced that "the fight continues until the final victory, that's our motto".</Text></Article><Article author="By Ben Tobias"><Text>Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov says his three sons, aged 14, 15 and 16, will soon travel to the Ukraine front line to fight with Russian forces. Kadyrov is a strong ally of Vladimir Putin, although has recently criticised Russian military leadership.On social media, he wrote that a father should teach his sons how to protect their family, people and fatherland. Russia has signed a UN treaty aimed at preventing children under the age of 18 from taking direct part in hostilities.Using children under the age of 15 to participate in hostilities is considered a war crime by the International Criminal Court. However Russia does not recognise its jurisdiction.In a long post on the Telegram messaging app, Kadyrov said his sons' military training began when they were much younger, and the time had come for them to experience a real battle. He also took aim at those "empty-worded" people who claimed the Chechen leader's loved-ones were not taking part in the military operation in Ukraine. The post was accompanied by a slickly-produced video of his sons firing various weapons at a training ground. Kadyrov has ruled the southern Russian republic since 2007, when he was named the region's president by Vladimir Putin. It has been a period of relative stability in Chechnya, which fought unsuccessfully for independence for a decade. But Kadyrov has been criticised for ruling with an iron fist, and allowing human rights violations to flourish. Kadyrov is a fierce supporter of Vladimir Putin, and Chechen forces have been fighting in Ukraine since the start of the war. However, after recent military setbacks in the Kharkiv and Donetsk regions, he criticised Russia's military leadership, describing one commander as a "mediocrity" and bemoaning a lack of basic logistics.He also called for Russia to take more drastic measures against Ukraine, including the use of a tactical nuclear weapon. The Kremlin responded that decisions like that should not be made emotionally.Kadyrov's criticism was in response to the retreat of Russian forces from the Ukrainian town of Lyman in Donetsk region - a major strategic setback for Moscow.Capturing the town is important for Ukrainian forces, because it can be used as a foothold to reach further into Russian-held parts of Ukraine. It was also being used by Russia as a logistics hub.The defeat in Lyman was also symbolic, as it happened just a day after a grand signing ceremony to annex four occupied regions of Ukraine - including Donetsk, where Lyman is situated. Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions all held so-called referendums on joining Russia last month, which were dismissed as a "sham" by Ukraine and its Western allies. On Sunday evening, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukrainian troops had also recaptured some territory in the Kherson region. Its Russian-installed head, Vladimir Saldo, described the situation there as "tense" and admitted Ukrainian forces had made breakthroughs. None of the four regions newly claimed by Russia are completely under Russian control, raising the question of how annexation will work - particularly in Ukrainian-controlled territory. The Kremlin says it will "consult" with residents of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions over where the borders should lie, suggesting that Russia may decide not to lay claim to the entire regions. In Luhansk and Donetsk the situation is different. Just before the war began Mr Putin recognised the whole of those regions as independent republics, which have now - as Moscow sees it - voted to join Russia. </Text></Article><Article author="BBC News"><Text>Kim Kardashian has agreed to pay a $1.26m (£1.12m) fine for advertising EthereumMax on her Instagram page.The US Securities and Exchange Commission said the reality TV star had received $250,000 for advertising the cryptocurrency, without disclosing she had been paid to do so.She also agreed not to promote crypto asset securities for three years.Her lawyer told BBC News: "Ms Kardashian is pleased to have resolved this matter with the SEC."The lawyer said: "Kardashian fully cooperated with the SEC from the very beginning and she remains willing to do whatever she can to assist the SEC in this matter. "She wanted to get this matter behind her to avoid a protracted dispute. "The agreement she reached with the SEC allows her to do that so that she can move forward with her many different business pursuits."Ms Kardashian, boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr, basketball player Paul Pierce and EthereumMax's creators were sued by investors in January.The legal action alleged they had collaborated to "misleadingly promote and sell" the cryptocurrency in a "pump and dump" scheme designed to inflate the price before selling to investors.EthereumMax disputed the allegations at the time.In spite of its name, EthereumMax has no legal or business connection with the Ethereum cryptocurrency.Anyone can create a crypto coin.All you need is a few pounds, a YouTube tutorial and a funky name.This month alone, dozens of new tokens will be launched, with creators promising their coin will be the next big thing.With little intrinsic value to the product, marketing is key - and as in many modern industries, celebrities can be the make or break. EthereumMax put a huge amount of money into snapping up celebrities such as Kim Kardashian - and at first, it seemed to be working out. But as with many crypto coins, the fall was as dramatic as the rise. Even if EthereumMax had retained the value it gained after the celebrity pump, regulators both in the US and UK were extremely uncomfortable about the marketing of the coin.The crypto industry is still largely unregulated - but Kim Kardashian joins a growing list of people and companies being punished for promoting these highly risky products.Gary Gensler, who chairs the SEC, called the case a "reminder" celebrity endorsement did not necessarily make a product worth investing in."Ms Kardashian's case also serves as a reminder to celebrities and others that the law requires them to disclose to the public when and how much they are paid to promote investing in securities," he said.Later, in a YouTube video about crypto investment, he added: "Celebrity endorsements... don't mean that an investment product is right for you or even, frankly, that it's legitimate."Even if a celebrity endorsement is genuine, each investment has its own risk and opportunities."When it comes to crypto, remember many of these are highly speculative assets. "You may be wondering if it's right for you or even if it might be a scam."</Text></Article><Article author="By James Gallagher"><Text>The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine has gone to Sweden's Svante Paabo for his work on human evolution. The Prize committee said he achieved the seemingly impossible task of cracking the genetic code of one of our extinct relatives - Neanderthals.He also performed the "sensational" feat of discovering the previously unknown relative - Denisovans.His work helped explore our own evolutionary history and how humans spread around the planet. The Swedish geneticist's work gets to the heart of some of the most fundamental questions - where do we come from and what allowed us, Homo sapiens, to succeed while our relatives went extinct.He was just off to pick his daughter up from a sleepover when he got the call saying he'd won. He told the BBC: "I was very surprised and overwhelmed, I had not expected this." The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterIn the 1990s, research on working out the human genetic code was taking place at pace. But that relied on fresh samples of pristine DNA.Prof Paabo's interest was in the old, degraded and contaminated genetic material from our ancestors. Many thought it was an impossible challenge. But he was, for the first time, able to sequence DNA from a 40,000-year-old piece of bone.Those results showed that Neanderthals - who mostly lived in Europe and Western Asia - were distinct from both modern day humans and chimpanzees.His work focused on hominins - the group of modern humans that includes us, Homo sapiens, but also our extinct relatives. "By revealing genetic differences that distinguish all living humans from extinct hominins, his discoveries provide the basis for exploring what makes us uniquely human", the Nobel committee said.BBC Podcast: Svante Paabo on the difference between us and NeanderthalsFurther comparisons between Neanderthal DNA and humans from around the world showed their DNA was a closer match to humans coming from Europe or Asia. This tells us that Homo sapiens had sex and children with Neanderthals after migrating out of Africa around 70,000 years ago. And you can still see the legacy of that today. Between 1-4% of modern human DNA comes from our Neanderthal relatives and this even affects our body's ability to respond to infection.The next seismic contribution to human origins came in 2008. Scientists had found a 40,000-year-old finger bone in the Denisova cave, in Siberia.Prof Paabo was able to sequence a sample of DNA and the results showed it was a previously unknown hominin - known as Denisovans. And it turned out Homo sapiens bred with Denisovans too. In parts of South East Asia up to 6% of people's DNA is Denisovan. Some of this genetic inheritance helps the body cope with low levels of oxygen, aids survival at high altitudes and is found in present-day Tibetans. Prof Paabo only heard the news this morning when he was called by Thomas Perlmann, the secretary for the Nobel Committee for Physiology or Medicine."He was overwhelmed, he was speechless. Very happy," said Prof Perlmann.Prof Paabo is seen as one of the founders of the scientific discipline of paleogenomics. He wins the 10m Swedish kronor (£800,000) prize. He follows in the footsteps of his father, Sune Bergstrom, who won the same Nobel Prize in 1982.His work shows there were already two distinct groups of hominins (Neanderthals and Denisovans) living in Eurasia when Homo sapiens spread from Africa.Analysis suggests these now extinct populations were small and relatively inbred and may not have been able to compete with rapidly expanding modern humans.Follow James on Twitter2021 - David Julius and Ardem Patapoutian for their work on how the body senses touch and temperature. 2020 - Michael Houghton, Harvey Alter and Charles Rice for the discovery of the virus Hepatitis C.2019 - Sir Peter Ratcliffe, William Kaelin and Gregg Semenza for discovering how cells sense and adapt to oxygen levels2018 - James P Allison and Tasuku Honjo for discovering how to fight cancer using the body's immune system2017- Jeffrey Hall, Michael Rosbash and Michael Young for unravelling how bodies keep a circadian rhythm or body clock2016 - Yoshinori Ohsumi for discovering how cells remain healthy by recycling waste2015 - William C Campbell, Satoshi Ōmura and Youyou Tu for anti-parasite drug discoveries</Text></Article><Article author="By Jasmine Andersson"><Text>King Charles will host the first state visit of his reign next month when he welcomes the president of South Africa to Buckingham Palace.President Cyril Ramaphosa and his wife, First Lady Tshepo Motsepe, have accepted an invitation to visit the King and Queen Consort.The visit will take place from Tuesday November 22 to Thursday November 24.It is understood the trip was in the early stages of being planned before the Queen's death in September.It will be the first time a South African leader has visited the UK in an official capacity in more than a decade, with the last state visit being in 2010 when Jacob Zuma visited the late Queen.The King has visited South Africa on a number of occasions since his first tour of the country in 1997, which included stops in Pretoria, Johannesburg, Durban and Cape Town.He last travelled to the country in 2011, with the Queen Consort. It was not a state event.The Queen shared a particularly close relationship with Nelson Mandela, the first democratically elected president of South Africa.

The company says it only uses sawdust and waste wood.Panorama analysed satellite images, traced logging licences and used drone filming to prove its findings. Reporter Joe Crowley also followed a truck from a Drax mill to verify it was picking up whole logs from an area of precious forest. Ecologist Michelle Connolly told Panorama the company was destroying forests that had taken thousands of years to develop."It's really a shame that British taxpayers are funding this destruction with their money. Logging natural forests and converting them into pellets to be burned for electricity, that is absolutely insane," she said.The row over the UK's largest power plantThe Drax power station in Yorkshire is a converted coal plant, which now produces 12% of the UK's renewable electricity.It has already received £6bn in green energy subsidies. Burning wood is considered green, but it is controversial among environmentalists. Panorama discovered Drax bought logging licences to cut down two areas of environmentally-important forest in British Columbia.One of the Drax forests is a square mile, including large areas that have been identified as rare, old-growth forest.The provincial government of British Columbia says old-growth forests are particularly important and that companies should put off logging them.Drax's own responsible sourcing policy says it "will avoid damage or disturbance" to primary and old-growth forest.  However, the latest satellite pictures show Drax is now cutting down the forest. The company told Panorama many of the trees there had died, and that logging would reduce the risk of wildfires. The entire area covered by the second Drax logging licence has already been cut down.  Burning wood produces more greenhouse gases than burning coal. The electricity is classed as renewable because new trees are planted to replace the old ones and these new trees should recapture the carbon emitted by burning wood pellets. But recapturing the carbon takes decades and the off-setting can only work if the pellets are made with wood from sustainable sources. Primary forests, which have never been logged before and store vast quantities of carbon, are not considered a sustainable source. It is highly unlikely that replanted trees will ever hold as much carbon as the old forest. Drax told the BBC it had not cut down the forests itself and said it transferred the logging licences to other companies. But Panorama checked and the authorities in British Columbia confirmed that Drax still holds the licences.Drax said it did not use the logs from the two sites Panorama identified. It said they were sent to timber mills - to make wood products - and that Drax only used the leftover sawdust for its pellets.The company says it does use some logs - in general - to make wood pellets. It claims it only uses ones that are small, twisted, or rotten.But documents on a Canadian forestry database show that only 11% of the logs delivered to the two Drax plants in the past year were classified as the lowest quality, which cannot be used for wood products. Panorama wanted to see if logs from primary forests cut down by logging companies were being transferred to Drax's Meadowbank pellet plant. The programme filmed a truck on a 120-mile round trip: leaving the plant, collecting piles of whole logs from a forest that had been cut down by a logging company and then returning to the plant for their delivery.Drax later admitted that it did use logs from the forest to make wood pellets. The company said they were species the timber industry did not want, and they would often be burned anyway to reduce wildfire risks. The company also said the sites identified by Panorama were not primary forest because they were near roads. But the UN definitions of primary forest do not mention proximity to roads and one of the sites is six miles from the nearest paved road.Panorama's findings come at a critical moment for Drax.The UK government is due to publish a new biomass strategy later this year, which will set out its policy for natural fuels like wood.A Drax spokesperson said 80% of material in its Canadian pellets is sawmill residuals, which would be disposed of anyway. They also said that Drax applies stringent sustainability standards to its own pellet production as well as suppliers, with verification from third-party certification schemes. "We are constantly reviewing these policies to ensure we take account of the latest science," they added.Panorama's The Green Energy Scandal Exposed is on BBC One at 20:00 on Monday 3rd October and on iPlayer afterwards</Text></Article><Article author="By Paul Glynn"><Text>Sacheen Littlefeather, the Native American activist who declined Marlon Brando's Oscar for The Godfather on his behalf in 1973, has died aged 75.The actress, who had breast cancer, died on Sunday, the Academy announced.Her death comes two weeks after the organisation honoured her at a ceremony in Los Angeles, publicly apologising for her treatment at the Oscars.Littlefeather, of Apache and Yaqui heritage, was booed while speaking on stage at the event 50 years ago.Dressed in full Apache attire during the first Oscars to be televised around the world, the Californian, born Maria Cruz, explained on Brando's behalf that he would not accept his best actor gong for the mafia movie in order to protest against the treatment of Native Americans by the film industry and to bring attention to the Wounded Knee protests.To whom does Wounded Knee belong? In 1973, several hundred locals, together with radical activists from the American Indian Movement (AIM), poured into the nearby village of Wounded Knee in South Dakota to protest government abuse.The protest resulted in a violent stand-off with federal agents that went on for 71 days."I went up there, like a proud Indian woman with dignity, with courage, with grace, and with humility," she remembered at the recent event."I knew that I had to speak the truth. Some people may accept it. And some people may not."Screen Actors Guild member Littlefeather struggled to get work in the industry afterwards but said it was "never too late for an apology... it's never too late for forgiveness."In a recent interview with Variety, she said she had made the Oscars speech in order to honour her ancestors and "native people everywhere"."I was met with the stereotypical tomahawk chop, individuals who called at me, and I ignored all of them," she recalled. "I continued to walk straight ahead with a couple of armed guards beside me, and I held my head high and was proud to be the first Indigenous woman in the history of the Academy Awards to make that political statement. "At that time in 1973, there was a media blackout on Wounded Knee and against the American Indian Movement that was occupying it," she went on. "Marlon had called them in advance and asked them to watch the Academy Awards, which they did."As they saw me, up on stage, refusing that Academy Award for the stereotypes within the film industry, and mentioning Wounded Knee in South Dakota, it would break the media boycott."In 2020, Littlefeather told the BBC that straight after the speech she had to leave the stage with two security guards. But, she added, it "was a very good thing" as actor John Wayne was backstage. She said he was "furious with Marlon and furious with me" and wanted to pull her off stage himself.Littlefeather featured in films like The Trial of Billy Jack, Johnny Firecloud and Counselor at Crime, but said she returned to San Francisco after being blacklisted by the industry, to continue her activism and work in health care and the theatre.Paying tribute online on Monday, Dakota/Lakota Sioux writer and biologist Ruth H. Robertson, aka Red Road Woman, pointed to Littlefeather's work with the American Indian Aids Institute of San Francisco.Lakota Man on Twitter offered: "It's with a heavy heart that I mourn the passing of Sacheen Littlefeather. I wish her a blessed journey", later adding: "Honour her".TV writer Joey Clift said: "When I talk about how our current Native storytelling movement in Hollywood is built on the shoulders of activists fighting tirelessly for decades for Native people to finally get our day in the sun, I'm talking about Sacheen Littlefeather. RIP."The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterIn announcing her death online, the Academy quoted Littlefeather, the subject of the 2021 documentary, Sacheen: Breaking the Silence, saying: "When I am gone, always be reminded that whenever you stand for your truth, you will be keeping my voice and the voices of our nations and our people alive."</Text></Article><Article author="By Natasha Booty"><Text>Burkina Faso's new military leader, Capt Ibrahim Traoré, has urged cabinet ministers to "move faster" to fix the country's "urgent" problems, including an insurgency by Islamist militants.The man he ousted in a coup on Friday has formally agreed to step down, religious and community leaders said.They said Capt Traoré had accepted Lt Col Paul-Henri Damiba's resignation and conditions he had set.He has gone to Togo, according to that country's government spokesman.In a recording widely shared on social media, Lt Col Damiba said he wished Burkina Faso's new leader every success. It is not known if he was alone when it was made.On Sunday Capt Traoré said the country was facing an emergency in every sector, "from security to defence, to health, to social action, to infrastructure", and it was time for government to "abandon the unnecessary red tape".He wants fast solutions to big problems, which some fear signals a turn towards Russia.Latest updates on Burkina Faso from BBC Africa LiveWhy France faces so much anger in West AfricaCoups that promised and failed to bring safetyRussia and France are engaged in a battle for influence in several former French colonies in West and Central Africa. At the weekend there were attacks on French institutions, after it was reported that Lt Col Damiba was sheltering at a French military base in the capital, Ouagadougou.France's foreign ministry said they were the work of "hostile demonstrators" who had been "manipulated by a disinformation campaign against us".Some in Ouagadougou chanted pro-Russian slogans and waved Russian flags as they greeted the new junta leader and his convoy on Sunday. He regards former colonial power France as an ally of the man he ousted, and has spoken of his willingness to work with new partners to fight Islamist insurgents - and analysts believe that could mean hiring Russian mercenaries.Russian military contractors are said to be active in neighbouring Mali, after French forces pulled out following a row with that country's military leaders. The Russians are accused by rights groups of committing abuses and massacres of civilians, which Russia has always denied.The head of the Russian mercenary Wagner group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has welcomed the takeover in Burkina Faso. Meanwhile, the Russian government said on Monday it "would like the situation in Burkina Faso to normalise as soon possible".Burkina Faso controls as little as 60% of its territory, experts say, and Islamist violence is worsening.The African Union has demanded the return of constitutional order by July 2023 at the latest, agreeing with the regional group Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) that the ousting of leader Lt Col Damiba was "unconstitutional".But Ecowas has since praised "the various parties in Burkina Faso for agreeing to a peaceful settlement of their differences", as days of power struggles came to an end without bloodshed.Lt Col Damiba formally resigned on Sunday in exchange for the new junta agreeing to respect seven conditions  - including a guarantee of his personal and family security, an agreement to continue with efforts at national reconciliation and a continued respect for the guarantee of returning to civilian rule within two years. The deposed colonel had himself ousted President Roch Kaboré in January, saying that he had failed to deal with growing militant Islamist violence.Many citizens in Burkina Faso have not felt safe for some time.The Islamist insurgency broke out in the country in 2015, leaving thousands dead and forcing an estimated two million people from their homes.This is Burkina Faso's ninth coup since independence from France in 1960.Additional reporting by Alys Davies</Text></Article><Article author="By Matt Murphy"><Text>Bulgaria's centre-right GERB party has won the country's parliamentary election, preliminary results show.Led by ex-Prime Minister Boyko Borissov, GERB took 25.4% of votes with 99% of ballots counted, officials said. But the 63-year-old faces a difficult task forming a working coalition, as most other parties have already ruled out working with him. Many of his opponents accuse him of overseeing government corruption during his time in office, which he denies.Mr Borissov has previously served three separate terms in Bulgaria's top job, and tackling graft became a key part of an election last November. Sunday's poll was called after the centrist government led by Kiril Petkov lost a no-confidence vote in June amid soaring inflation. The 42-year-old Harvard educated economist ran on an anti-corruption ticket and had urged voters to let him "continue the change" ahead of the vote. But he conceded defeat on Sunday evening after his We Continue to Change party took just 20.4% of the vote. Mr Petkov told reporters that "GERB has the responsibility to form a coalition and govern the country". He has already ruled out working with Mr Borissov, pledging to be an "opposition scrutinising the spending of every lev". Pundits say Bulgaria now faces an uncertain political outlook. "The situation is the same as after the last election but even more complicated," Daniel Smilov from the Centre for Liberal Strategies, told the BTV network. "Coalitions that were possible then are no longer possible now." Mr Borissov says he is willing to work with any party to form a working government, but is likely to have to rely on two pro-Russian parties and the Turkish minority MRF grouping. "What's important for us is for reason to prevail," he said on Sunday. "Believe me, right now I am the most well-meaning and open person to all parties."Whoever leads Bulgaria's next government, the EU's poorest nation faces a host of challenges. Inflation has continued to soar - hitting 15% in August - as energy prices spiral amid a dispute with the Russian state-owned gas giant Gazprom. And ministers will also face a difficult challenge managing the country's relationship with Moscow, after Mr Petkov's government turned its back on Vladimir Putin's regime in April. Bulgaria is an EU and Nato member, and Mr Borissov recently called President Putin the "clear aggressor" in Russia's war with Ukraine. Final results from Sunday's election are expected to come on Thursday after overseas postal votes are counted.</Text></Article><Article author="By Omega Rakotomalala &amp; Farouk Chothia"><Text>Said to have been a shy but intelligent boy in school, Burkina Faso's Capt Ibrahim Traoré has become the latest military officer to seize power in a coup in one of France's former colonies in West Africa. He overthrew his former comrade, Lt Col Paul-Henri Damiba on 30 September, after accusing him of failing to fulfil his promise of quelling the Islamist insurgency that has gripped Burkina Faso since 2015.Born in 1988, this makes the 34-year-old captain the youngest head of state in Africa, joining the ranks of two other coup leaders - Guinea's charismatic Col Mamady Doumbouya, born in 1981, and Mali's bearded Col Assimi Goïta, born in 1983."I know I'm younger than most of you here. We didn't want what happened but we didn't have a choice," Capt Traoré told government officials.During Lt-Col Damiba's short time in power, attacks by militant Islamists - some of them linked to the Islamic State group and al-Qaeda - increased in Burkina Faso as they seized territory in rural areas and encircled cities, leaving the state in control of only about 60% of the country, according to some estimates. With a lack of strong democratic institutions in a country where the military has long been dominant, Capt Traoré seized power with a pledge to improve security in a nation living in fear of the militants. His coup - the second in Burkina Faso in less than nine months - is the latest sign of the epidemic of coups that UN chief António Guterres raised concern about in 2021."My appeal, obviously, is for - especially the big powers - to come together for the unity of the Security Council in order to make sure that there is effective deterrence in relation to this epidemic of coup d'états," Mr Guterres said at the time. But with global powers focused either on domestic crises - or the war in Ukraine - they have paid little attention to the instability that has wracked countries such as Burkina Faso. If anything, Burkina Faso and some other countries have found themselves increasingly embroiled in the cold war rivalry that has been reignited by the Ukraine conflict, as Russia seeks to expands its influence in the region at the expense of France, which has retained close economic, military and cultural ties to many of its former colonies in Africa. "I know that France cannot interfere directly in our affairs," Capt Traoré said, adding: "The Americans are our partners now, [but] we can also have Russia as a partner."His comments suggest that he could follow the example of his counterpart in Mali, who has allegedly brought in the controversial Russian security group, Wagner, to replace the French in the fight against jihadists, albeit with little success, as the insurgency has worsened there too since the military staged a coup in August 2020. Capt Traoré cut his teeth fighting the jihadists in Mali. He served in a UN force there, and reportedly "showed bravery" in the face of a "complex attack" by militants in the northern Timbuktu region - famous for its centuries-old buildings -  in 2018.The following year, he participated in a military operation codenamed Otapuanu in Burkina Faso's restive east for seven months. He also served in a detachment of Markoye in the northern Sahel region and took part in several operations there."Traore is close to his men, wilful and courageous. He could not do six months without going to a detachment," an unnamed source was quoted as saying on Burkina Faso's Radio Omega.But Capt Traoré  is no decorated war general, only a captain who studied at a local military academy, joined the army in 2009 and received artillery training in Morocco.He chose a military career after completing his schooling in Burkina Faso's second city, Bobo-Dioulasso, with reports describing him as "shy and rather reserved" but also "very intelligent".Now, Capt Traoré has found himself at the centre of international glare, with some going as far as drawing parallels between him and Burkina Faso's famous revolutionary, Thomas Sankara - not surprising in a nation looking for political saviours after decades of misrule."Ibrahim Traoré has taken over the leadership of the country, like a certain Thomas Sankara, [and] like him after a military coup, captain like him, 34 years old like him.

Police responded by firing tear gas.In the panic to escape, people were trampled and crushed at the exits. At least 125 - including dozens of children, one as young as three - were killed, the authorities say.Some fans died in the arms of the players they had come to cheer on just hours earlier, the coach of home team Arema FC revealed."I can only mention a terrifying scenario," Sergio Silva, a Portuguese star for the side said. "Police cars on fire, everything broken, corridors with blood, people's shoes."People were desperate, they had seen people die and were trying to escape," he told Portuguese sports newspaper, A Bola.Authorities on Monday launched an investigation - following allegations of heavy-handed policing. Public anger has escalated - with mourners chanting "murderers" at officials. At least 18 police officers are being investigated for their action on field.So how did this all unfold? Here's what we know so far.There had been concerns in the lead-up to the game - between Arema FC and long-time rivals, Persebaya Surabaya, another East Java-based team - as violence between fans was not unprecedented. So extra precautions were put in place - including more security "for preventive measures", Maike Ira Puspita, deputy secretary-general of the Indonesian Football Association, told the BBC.They also banned visiting Persebaya fans from coming to the match, meaning it was just a home crowd - an over-capacity attendance of 42,000 people - who roared on their team on Saturday night.The FA also deployed extra police. And during the game's first half, all was "manageable". "The security happening like usual," says Ms Puspita. "Half-time was ok."Eyewitnesses have disputed this, telling the BBC there was scuffles at half time with tensions building throughout the second half.When the game ended, Arema had lost 3-2. "And this is the point when some of the supporters ran onto the pitch. And it all just started to break out from there," Ms Puspita said.It is unclear - and in fierce contention - what exactly happened next. Authorities are unwilling to even specify a chronology of what happened on the field."I think it's better for all of us to wait for the investigation team," Ms Puspita told the BBC.But what is known is that after the final whistle blew, Arema fans moved onto the pitch, where the team's footballers were gathered in the middle. Police had already escorted Persebaya to their changing rooms, the BBC's Indonesian service reported.Sergio Silva said many of those streaming onto the field had appeared to come to "show support, not attack". But recognising the situation was escalating, the team returned to the changing rooms.At some point, police began to fire tear gas into the thousands-strong crowd, volleys aimed at dispersing them. One eyewitness told the BBC that police fired tear gas rounds "continuously and fast".Witnesses say police were unnecessarily brutal - and that along with the clouds of stinging gas, officers were beating fans with batons.The gas had an overwhelming effect - sparking a mass exodus. Fans fled down the field, heading towards the stadium's narrow exits. But with a crowd of thousands beating at each others' backs, and with many still suffering gas inhalation, it became a crush at the gates.In the scrabble to get out, people punched and clawed holes in the wall to try and pull themselves free. The weight of people pushing against the iron gates left them bent outwards. In other places, the crush left some people dying by the changing rooms.Huddled in the locker rooms, Silva said he and his teammates spent what felt like hours barricading themselves. They heard the roar of the crowd, the screams of distress in the corridors."People were desperate, they had seen people die and were trying to escape. We ended up letting in some of these people," he said.It was, he said, a scenario more reminiscent "of destruction, of war... nothing to do with football". "Fans died in the arms of players," Javier Roca, the Arema coach, told Spanish broadcaster Cadena Ser. "I'm mentally shattered. I feel a heavy burden, even a heavy responsibility." He added: "I think the police overstepped their mark."The exact death toll is yet to be confirmed. Many fans are undergoing treatment, and some of those injured are reported have suffered brain injuries.Police have characterised what happened as a riot in which two officers also died. They've accused fans of attacking officers and damaging cars - the burnt-out wreckage of vehicles can be seen in photographs. But anger against officials is rising: at vigils across the nation, protests have broken out calling for police to be held accountable. In the capital Jakarta, mourners chanted "Murderer! Murderer!" and taped signs reading "Kanjuruhan Massacre" to fences.In Malang, anti-police messages have been graffitied on the Kanjuruhan stadium.On Monday, Mohammad Mahfud Mahmodin, Indonesia's minister for political, legal and security affairs, said the government was asking police to "reveal the perpetrators involved in the crime".He said a soldier had been seen in footage carrying out an unauthorised act, without specifying what it was.Separately, the police have announced an investigation into 18 officers who were "holding the throwing weapons".Indonesia is known for violent flare-ups between rival football supporters. The country's police force also has a record of brutality - and has been criticised for frequently using tear gas, despite it being banned by Fifa, world football's governing body, as a crowd control measure."In many riots in football stadiums, police are accustomed to using tear gas - this is an abnormality that has been normalised," said Fajar Junaedi, a lecturer and football researcher at the Universitas Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta.He noted a case in 2012, where a supporter died from being tear-gassed by police and there was no follow-up investigation.Ms Puspita had earlier declined to answer the BBC's question on whether the police use of tear gas was a standard accepted procedure in the Liga.She stressed the actions organisers had taken earlier in the year to help teams manage crowds, including security workshops for first league clubs and coordination with police."At this point, it is unfair to point fingers. This is something that's a black day for all of us - a tragic and devastating incident," she said.Additional reporting by Raja Lumbanrau off BBC Indonesian</Text></Article><Article author="By Katy Watson"><Text>When the results came through on Sunday evening, there were cheers for Lula - as well as tears - but the atmosphere felt more like a sense of relief than outright celebration. This wasn't the first-round victory that his supporters had wished for. The polls released a day before the elections had predicted a 14 percentage point gap between Lula and Bolsonaro. They had hoped Lula could avoid a run-off but they vastly underestimated the support for the right-wing leader."I've never won an election in the first round, it's like destiny wants me to work a bit more," Lula said, trying to reassure people of his chances. "We are going to win the elections again, it's just a question of time."Lula is still the front-runner and his position is still strong. But there is no doubt this has been a blow to the Lula campaign. In the past few weeks, there had been a concerted effort by his supporters to try and encourage wavering voters to choose Lula, to end the Bolsonaro presidency promptly.Lula and Bolsonaro to face run-off in BrazilWhy Brazil's election matters so much to the US'Our candidate isn't perfect, but he beats the alternative'The show of strength from the right - not just from Bolsonaro but prominent Bolsonaristas who were also elected to congress and as state governors - has taken people by surprise."Bolsonarism is much more alive and has a further reach than people had thought and polls had captured," says Esther Solano, a political scientist and Bolsonaro expert."What we underestimated was the network of regional Bolsonarism. We have to rethink how we are failing to measure the true reach of Bolsonarism in daily life across Brazil."In his post-results speech, Bolsonaro adopted a more humble tone than in the past - a break from his often fiery politics about the left. Perhaps a conscious effort to win over those who are still undecided."I know there's a desire to change from people but there are certain changes that can be for the worse," he said. "We tried to show that during the campaign but clearly that didn't get through to the most important layers of society."Bolsonaro vowed to show people how to ensure Brazil wouldn't become Venezuela - it's a common comparison that the far-right makes when criticising the left.In the run-up to this vote, Bolsonaro repeatedly said that the polls were a lie - and to many it looked like he was just a bad loser. But reflecting on Sunday's results, there are people who think that Bolsonaro has a point. It's certainly what Bolsonaro's supporters believe."It's time for liberty, for justice," says teacher Selma Cardoso who said the polls were biased. If Lula wins she's prepared to take action. "We'll go to the streets saying people are making a mistake. It's time to change - but peacefully."But others who support the president threaten to take a more violent approach."There's going to be beautiful blood spilled in this city," Alessandro Ferreira Soares, a parachutist, told me if Lula takes the presidency. "I'm prepared to kill all the socialists and communists in the world."It's these ominous threats that make people worried. These next four weeks are going to be intense - and personal. With two powerful political foes now going head-to-head, the campaign steps up several notches.There's everything to play for in this presidential race - and everything to lose if you're on the wrong side. We saw political violence in the run-up to the first round and there's real fear there will be more of that ahead of the run-off.</Text></Article><Article author="By Hugh Schofield"><Text>If France wants to lead Europe to a new era of military self-reliance, how come its contribution to the war effort in Ukraine is so small?That is the awkward question being posed by some of the country's top strategic thinkers, who are pushing President Emmanuel Macron to make an urgent decision on more arms to Kyiv.Recent analysis conducted on the ground in Poland and Ukraine shows that the French share of foreign arms deliveries is less than 2%, way behind the US on 49%, but also behind Poland (22%) and Germany (9%)."I was concerned about the reliability of the statistics which showed France low on the list of contributing countries," says François Heisbourg, who is perhaps France's most influential defence analyst."So I went out to the main distribution hub in Poland to see how much in tonnage was actually being delivered, rather than just promised."Unfortunately the figures bore out my fears. France is way down the list - in ninth position."The official reaction to this in Paris is: "Yes, but..." Yes, the aid statistics are unflattering, but there are other factors at work.First, defence officials say the true measure of military help is quality not quantity. Some countries are delivering masses of outdated equipment. France has given 18 Caesar self-propelled artillery units, which are now celebrated along the Ukrainian front-line.France, they add, is like other Western countries in having run down military stocks as part of the post-Cold War peace dividend.Ukraine's Caesars are fully one quarter of France's entire mobile artillery. It cannot offer much more without making itself vulnerable in regions where it is already committed, like the Sahel and the Indo-Pacific."It might look like we are behind other countries, but France has every intention of playing its part," says Gen Jérome Pellistrandi, editor of the National Defence Review.These arguments are not without merit, says Mr Heisbourg. The problem is that by not being more present in theatre, France risks writing itself out of the plot."When I was in Kyiv, everyone was very polite. I had no sense that the Ukrainians disapproved of us," he says. "In a way it was worse. I had the distinct feeling we were becoming irrelevant."For Mr Heisbourg the equation is simple. Ukraine will talk to countries who it knows are likely to deliver the weapons it needs. France at the moment is not one of them.But there is another danger for France. Its relative absence in Ukraine undermines its bid for leadership in the cause of European defence.Already many countries of eastern Europe are wary of President Macron, who they believe was far too indulgent towards Russia's Vladimir Putin in the first months of the war. A narrative has taken root according to which France still feels ambivalent about an outright Ukrainian triumph.For Pierre Haroche, who lectures on international security at Queen Mary University of London, this narrative is unfair - and is not the reason for France's low levels of arms deliveries to Ukraine.However, he is firmly of the view that France should beef up its contribution as early as possible, in order to reassure eastern European countries like Poland that "we are all on the same page". "France's goal of strategic autonomy for Europe is focused primarily on building up our defence industries via joint procurement. But if you want joint procurement, you have to demonstrate to other countries that you have the same vision about our common security," he says."In order to make our objective of European co-operation viable, we need to show eastern European countries that co-operating with France and buying the idea of strategic autonomy is not a strategic risk."Dr Haroche is calling for France to send 50 Leclerc main battle tanks. Mr Heisbourg would prefer air defence systems, which he says Ukraine is more in need of."It is like a fire extinguisher," says Dr Haroche. "If there is a fire in a neighbour's house it is better to offer your extinguisher straightaway, and not wait till the fire reaches your own home."It's not just generosity. It's also for your own protection." </Text></Article><Article author="By Navin Singh Khadka"><Text>Renowned US ski mountaineer Hilaree Nelson, who died in the Himalayas a week ago, was cremated on Sunday in a Buddhist ceremony in Nepal's capital Kathmandu. Fellow climbers have been telling the BBC how she was an inspirational figure to a generation of women.In 2012 Hilaree Nelson became the first woman to climb Everest (8,849m; 29,032 feet) and its neighbour, Lhotse (8,516m), within 24 hours. Six years later she was back on Lhotse, and she and her partner, Jim Morrison, became the first to ski down the mountain.On Monday 26 September, the couple were skiing down another Himalayan mountain, Manaslu (8,163m), when they triggered an avalanche that swept Hilaree Nelson over a cliff to her death, at the age of 49.Many of those paying tribute to her have noted that she was the equal of any male climber."She was doing things with top male mountain athletes, side by side," said Dave Watson, an international mountain guide who was on Mt Manaslu with Nelson and Morrison, before the couple left to climb to the summit."Her efforts were erasing the label of 'first male'/ 'first female' - it was 'first person'."She was a ground-breaking mountain sports athlete, and she did it with grace and a big smile. Hilaree's influence cannot be overstated."The 36-year-old Swedish climber and adventure athlete, Maria Granberg, who attended Hilaree Nelson's funeral, described her as a trailblazer and a "curious, committed, rare and resilient spirit" who was a role model for younger women."She led expeditions reaching out a hand to the younger generation to follow, showing the ropes, and our future selves got the memo of how to show up as an athlete and human being."In the most human way, she paved the way and shed a light on everything that we as female athletes aspire to become, by creating a life and career coloured by grace, grit and wild aspirations."Another younger climber, Melissa Arnot Reid - the first American woman to climb Everest without supplemental oxygen - met Hilaree Nelson on Everest 10 years ago, on the expedition when Nelson achieved the double of Everest and Lhotse in 24 hours. "She was so strong, so driven but had such willingness to be vulnerable," she told the BBC."As a female in this industry, it's so difficult to be vulnerable without seeming weak, but she did that perfectly and in doing so, showed me what was possible."Her mountain skills and fitness and drive were incredible, but I'm certain she will mostly be remembered for remaining exceptionally human while doing superhuman things."Hilaree Nelson carried out more than 40 expeditions in 16 countries, from the high Himalayas to one of the most remote mountains in Myanmar, and also Antarctica, where in 2020 she climbed the continent's two highest peaks - and skied down both.Billi Bierling, who heads the Himalayan database - keeping records of all expeditions on the Nepalese Himalayas - met Ms Nelson after her record-breaking ski descent from Lhotse in 2018."It was amazing to meet her, she was a great ski mountaineer," she says."The whole mountaineering scene is still very much in male hands. You do have some amazing women climbers, but Hilaree was an extreme skier too, while mountain skiing is also mainly male-dominated."Dave Watson, who was on Manaslu with Hilaree Nelson and Jim Morrison before they left for the summit, says he decided to stay put at camp three, because there were strong winds and a risk of avalanches. In fact, on the same day that the couple reached the summit there was another avalanche that killed one Sherpa and injured more than a dozen other climbers.Jim Morrison got down safely, though, after seeing Hilaree Nelson swept away, and was one of those who found her body on Wednesday.The outpouring of grief seen among the mountaineering community is a sign of how badly it has been rocked by her death, Ms Bierling says."She was a loving and a committed mother of two beautiful children."But by the same token, she fulfilled her dreams and she was beautiful and always very humble."</Text></Article><Article author="By Orla Guerin"><Text>As Russia's Vladimir Putin announces the annexation of swathes of sovereign Ukrainian territory, issues nuclear threats and mobilises hundreds of thousands of reservists, the response from Ukrainian forces on the eastern front is unchanged - they will fight for every last inch of soil.We travel to front-line positions in the city of Bakhmut in Donetsk - one of the four regions which President Putin is now illegally claiming as his own. Our journey is made in stages.We slow down to cross the Bakhmutovka river, speed up to cover exposed ground, then weave through a dangerous curtain of downed power lines. For the last few metres, we run. All the while, the shelling is constant - part of war's familiar soundscape.But when we reach the front-line troops, inside a battle-scarred building, we hear something else - the crackle of small arms fire. The two sides are so close they can target each other with rifles.The Russians are around 400 metres (437 yards) in front of us, and trying hard to close in. We are warned there is a Russian sniper to the rear. At his post below ground, where a ginger cat keeps him company, the unit commander is sombre and blunt. "It's pretty hard here now," says Oleksandr, a 31-year-old. "It's stressful. Everyone is under pressure. The enemy is very near, but we are standing and fighting back."He dismisses President Putin's recent referendums as "delusional" and says Ukrainians will not be dictated to at the barrel of a Russian gun. "In my view, those referendums will change nothing. We will fight Putin's army and make them withdraw from our land," he says. Oleksandr knows the cost of war - and not only from fighting his own battles."My brother died," he tells me, adding: "But I don't know where and when that happened, because he was drafted by a different drafting office from a different region. He died as well as a few of my comrades, officers who trained with me. I found out they were dead, too. So, I have lost family and friends."He has not lost his will to fight. Neither has 25-year-old Roman, who is operating a key weapon in this war - a drone.Roman is upstairs in a bombed-out room, littered with debris and broken glass, where two more cats are in residence. The screensaver on his phone is a picture of his five-month-old son Kyrylo, born since the war broke out. He has seen his only child once. "I see him in pictures and video, not in real life," he says. "It's hard, but it's also hard to imagine what the Russians could do to my family if they reach them. "I don't want them to do what they did in Bucha. I lived in Kyiv, and I understand clearly how the women feel. If we are weak, they will come for our families."There is concern here about the mobilisation in Russia. In the coming months the Kremlin will be sending many more soldiers into battle.It is unclear how well-trained or well-equipped they will be, but the Ukrainians are worried about the quantity, not the quality. They are already outnumbered. In the battle for Bakhmut they have faced a seemingly endless supply of Russian fighters. In August there were five waves in a row, according to Iryna, an army spokeswoman."They just go, and they don't stop. They don't react to firing or shelling. Some of the prisoners of war we captured were from Wagner [a Russian mercenary group]. They had better weapons," Iryna says. Troops here believe the Russians are pushing hard for victory in Bakhmut because of their recent humiliating defeats in the north-east and the south, where Ukraine reclaimed about 6,000 sq km (2,317 sq miles) of territory.For now, Bakhmut is stuck in President Putin's throat. It is an obstacle in his bid to swallow all of a mineral rich area known as Donbas - comprised of Donestk and Luhansk.  Having failed to fully capture Donbas, he has annexed both regions.As he tries to conquer Bakhmut - once home to about 70,000 people - the city has been bled of life.Downtown we see a large apartment block with the centre gouged out by an airstrike three months ago. Many of the windows are boarded up. It looks abandoned, but my colleague hears a woman's cry inside the building.We call out, and Lyudmila appears from behind the plastic sheeting that covers her window on the second floor. At first, it is difficult to hear her over the deep rumble of rocket fire."It's very hard," she shouts. "They bombard us. Yesterday a man was killed in the backyard [by shelling]. There's almost no-one left in the building. "Everything is leaking. There is water everywhere. All the walls are cracked. It is very difficult. But at least we get humanitarian aid. Every three days, they bring bread."The white-haired pensioner is living in the shattered building with her husband and a handful of others. "We can't go anywhere," she tells us. "We have no money, and I am in a wheelchair." A neighbour tells us the building has been hit five times. Lyudmila was in her kitchen when the missile struck on 1 July. "It came, out of the blue," she says. "God himself saved me."But can this city be saved?For now, the frontline is holding. Ukrainian forces are blocking the Russian advance. But here even the dead are not safe.There is an old cemetery on the city's green outskirts, in the path of incoming shells. Mounds of dark soil top the fresh graves - those killed in recent months, since the city became a battleground.As a coffin is lowered into the ground - watched by a few mourners - the silence is broken by shelling. The first launch is outgoing, but moments later an incoming round lands in the hills opposite the graveyard. Then a second strike, closer still. It is time to leave.As we race towards the edge of Bakhmut there is an explosion on the road right in front of us, between 100 to 200 metres ahead. We manage a sharp left turn and follow another route out.Many battles are still raging in Ukraine. President Putin is doubling down - and winter is coming.This is a dangerous new phase in Europe's newest war.When asked how long she thought the conflict would last, the army spokeswoman replied: "A long, long time."</Text></Article><Article author="By Bernd Debusmann Jr and Alexandra Ostasiewicz"><Text>For Renee Smith and her paralysed, cancer-stricken husband Christopher, evacuation was not an option when Hurricane Ian came violently bearing down on their Florida home. "It would have taken an ambulance, a stretcher, and three grown men to move him," she said of Christopher, who became paralysed just days before the hurricane as a result of prostate cancer spreading to his spine. "I had no control and it was terrifying."Without any other choices, Mrs Smith resorted to desperate measures to protect her husband. She used cable ties and gaffer tape to attach a tarpaulin to his hospital bed in a bid to keep him dry and used his wheelchair to barricade the front door from the 150mph (241km/h) winds. Even that, she feared, may have not been enough. "I'm his caretaker, so I stayed," she told the BBC from her home in Punta Gorda - one of the Gulf Coast communities hardest hit by the category four storm. "I put a life preserver around his neck, kissed him and told him I loved him."In Mrs Smith's case, the danger primarily came from the hurricane's ferocious winds. Many others were hit by a powerful storm surge. Suzie Mack, a Fort Myers resident, told the BBC that her brother's mobile home park saw water as high as 8ft during the storm. "They got on their air mattresses inside their house, because it was too late to leave, and by the time the surge got to its peak, they had about a foot of air left in their homes," she said. "Nobody died there, but it was a horrific story to hear." Not everyone was so lucky. So far, Florida officials have confirmed 44 deaths from the hurricane across the state - most of these in Lee County - with US networks reporting even higher tolls. Hurricane Ian - Maps and images showing destructionIn Pictures: Floridians take in Hurricane Ian's impactIn Ian's wake, some Florida residents have come under criticism for failing to heed repeated warnings and calls to evacuate. But for families like the Smiths and hundreds of thousands of others, logistical and financial hurdles to evacuation meant that staying was the only option. Others were simply trapped by bad luck.A woman who identified herself as Melodye, for example, fled from her home in the Tampa Bay area to Fort Myers. By the time it was clear that Ian's track had shifted south, it was too late for her to leave. "My area turned out to be safe, never got hit," she told the BBC at a mobile home park near Fort Myers. "I came down here and experienced the worst thing I've ever experienced in my whole life.""If there is another, I'm going to Chicago," she added. While for the moment the scale of Ian's destruction remains unclear, independent experts have warned that the economic impact is likely to be well into the tens of billions of dollars. Consultancy firm Milliman estimated that only 18% of people in areas under evacuation order had flood insurance, putting many residents in difficult or impossible financial situations as they seek to rebuild their homes or recover their losses. Governor Ron DeSantis - who called Ian a "500-year flood event" - said that the storm may well have "changed the character of our state".In these conditions, many Florida residents have been left wondering what their future looks like - and whether to stay in the state or to leave.  Tom, a 48-year-old resident of the town of Port Charlotte, 38 miles (61km) from Fort Myers, told the BBC that he decided to leave the morning after the storm along with his 66-year-old mother, Kathy. While the pair had already planned a move to Colorado, the hurricane prompted them to pack up and leave the morning after Ian passed. "The town is destroyed," Kathy said. So was her home for the last six years.For residents of the Sun Seekers mobile home park in North Fort Myers - many of them transplants from other parts of the US - the government may make the decision to relocate for them by declaring the property "uninhabitable". Cindy Brackett, a resident of the mobile home park, said that the prospect of being forced from her home was an additional and unwelcome trauma, just days after the violent hurricane. "With my arthritis, I can't do anything. I can't even walk out of my home. I feel so useless," Ms Brackett said. She doesn't want to leave and isn't sure where she would go if she had to.Federal officials and the American Red Cross say that about 10,000 displaced people are currently in shelters - not including people who may have taken shelter with friends, family or left the area entirely. State and federal officials have promised millions of dollars in relief funds, but many people on the ground remain sceptical of how - and whether - it will reach them. For those able - and willing - to stay, the effort to rebuild has already begun. Across damaged parts of western Florida, the BBC saw people beginning to clear debris from their homes and businesses, sweeping away palm fronds and parts of shattered houses. In some places, people were working to clear cars that had been overturned or crushed by felled trees, or boats that had been left sitting useless and far from the water."People around here are devastated," said Cal Bruno, the owner of a Fort Myers restaurant that gave away thousands of pasta meals to residents for free after the storm. "But we'll come together." Among those vowing to stay to help with the effort is construction worker Alejandro Carrera, an Argentine immigrant and 14-year resident of Fort Myers. "We will rebuild," he told the BBC, standing just feet from a shattered local marina. "I work in construction. I'm going to have a ton of work."Phoebe Gavin, a Washington-DC based native of Sanibel Island - whose aging parents fled across a causeway to nearby Fort Myer just ahead of the storm - said that she's "pessimistic" about the island's immediate reconstruction. Sanibel - which is located just off the coast and has a population of about 6,000 - was among the hardest-hit communities during the hurricane.Parts of the causeway connecting the barrier island to Florida were destroyed during the storm, severing access from the rest of the state. "I can't see it as a top priority as far as rebuilding," she said. "It would be shocking to me if we saw previous levels of road traffic within the next year."  A lack of connectivity to the mainland, she said, would be devastating to a community which survives largely on tourism. The alternative to a working causeway - a ferry - could potentially drive tourists away. "A lot of people would choose a much easier option," she said. Just across the shattered causeway in Fort Myers, pensioner Lucia Kim said that while she is confident that local communities will get back to normal sooner than later, she fears that some of the "spirit" of the area might be lost. "There is an atmosphere here," said Ms Kim, who moved from New York a decade ago attracted by the freedom and sense of community. "Just look at the 1960s architecture as well," she added, gesturing at art deco buildings in the distance. "Who knows what comes next?" After Hurricane Ian passed, Renee Smith cautiously emerged from her home to survey the damage.What she found wasn't encouraging. Her driveway remains covered in debris and detritus from nearby buildings, including some items she immediately recognised as having been ripped from a four-storey hotel blocks away. To make matters worse, Mrs Smith's front door won't shut, her chimney has collapsed and parts of her roof were blown away, leaving her and her bedridden husband partially exposed to the elements. Mrs Smith, however, sees things that may suggest that the damage in her devastated community could ultimately lead to a stronger and more resilient neighbourhood. Many of the buildings rebuilt after previous hurricanes - such as 2004's Hurricane Charley - managed to weather the storm better than the rest of the town. In any case, her husband's condition means that rain or shine, she'll be staying put. She has no choice.  For the moment, however, she is simply happy that mother nature has given her a reprieve. Since Hurricane Ian passed, the sun is back out while Florida's often oppressive heat has been replaced by more comfortable temperatures. "We're very fortunate," she said of the conditions after the storm. "It could have been a lot worse."Additional reporting from John Sudworth and Azadeh Moshiri</Text></Article><Article author="By Orla Guerin"><Text>Victory can look desolate. It does inside the eastern Ukrainian town of Lyman, retaken from the Russians at the weekend. The deserted debris-strewn streets are lined by boarded up or burnt-out buildings. Metal sheeting dangling from smashed roofs is buffeted by the wind. Few civilians venture out. We counted almost as many dogs as people - though the population was around 20,000 before the war.The handful of civilians we met seem shell-shocked by months of bombardment, and uncertain their ordeal is over.The only surge of life was a convoy of Ukrainian troops riding high on top of armoured personnel carriers, waving and cheering, as they headed out of town, along a road bordered by pine forest.They roared past evidence of the human cost of Russia's defeat.The bodies of five dead Russian soldiers lay near each other, now bloated, and contorted by death, but once somebody's husband or somebody's son. They were in full uniform, with boots still on, as if they might somehow return to the fight.  They appear to have been cut down together as they tried to flee. Nearby we saw a heap of discarded Russian uniforms, sleeping bags, and ration packs. There was an army backpack with a name written on it. We don't know what became of its owner. Two young volunteers from a Ukrainian humanitarian group were working carefully and quietly, numbering the bodies, and looking for anything that might identify them.   They were kneeling just metres away from mines scattered along the roadside, their dark green colour camouflaged by the grass and leaves. They are a lingering threat from an enemy that has been driven into retreat, or as Russia's defence ministry put it, was "withdrawn to more advantageous positions". That statement has a familiar ring to it after the domino of Russian routs last month in Kharkiv province in the north-east.Later the volunteers manoeuvred the remains into black body bags and drove them away - some of Russia's fallen soldiers finally leaving the battlefield.A new Ukrainian flag was flying atop a captured Russian T72  tank, parked by the roadside. "We are going to win," said the smiling young Ukrainian soldier clambering around the gun turret. "I feel very good, very great." What happened here isn't just a defeat for President Vladimir Putin. It's a complete humiliation. Just last Friday he announced to the world he was annexing four Ukrainian regions, including Donetsk, where Lyman is located. He proclaimed that they would be "Russian forever".A day later Ukrainian forces were inside Lyman, and his troops were running for their lives.Ukraine says as many as 5,000 Russian troops were encircled in Lyman, before the town fell. We don't know how many were killed or captured. The defence ministry in Kyiv said in a tweet that almost all the Russian troops deployed to Lyman had been "redeployed either into body bags or into captivity".The strategic town is a gateway to the neighbouring region of Luhansk, which is almost entirely in Russia's grip. Ukraine is hoping to advance further, using its victory here as a springboard.Lena and her 10-year-old Radion are hoping for peace, and for running water.  We met the mother and son heading for a well to refill a five-litre container."I think it will be peaceful," said Lena, who wore a black hat and a few layers of woollen jumpers, "It should be peaceful. Everyone has suffered enough. The hardest thing was to survive the shelling. We prayed as we stayed in the cellar. The situation is still tense but overall, I am happy."While deprived of school, Radion has learnt the lessons of war. His face is sombre, beneath his deep blue hat. "It was a bit scary in Lyman," he tells us "because there was a lot of bombing. War is very bad because people are dying. It's more peaceful in my heart now."Others here still seem lost in their trauma, like 66-year-old Nadia. She was alone on the streets, walking slowly, as if she could not recognise her surroundings."I hope for the best," she said "and that they [the Russians] won't come back here. It was very bad. Both sides were firing. We didn't understand anything. When it was quiet, we went outside to cook. Then it started again. We have all gone mad now."And she had a question for us. "Why am I being bombarded?" she beseeched us. "I didn't do anything bad. I didn't kill. I didn't steal. I don't understand why. Maybe you can tell me. We lived well, everything was good, we worked.  And in one moment it was turned upside down."In the streets around town pro-Russian slogans have been daubed on walls, kiosks and bus shelters. "CCCP" is daubed on a closed shop front - the Cyrillic letters for USSR, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.Much as President Putin may wish to resurrect the Soviet Union of his youth, the ruins of Lyman stand as testament to his failure.Ukraine now has momentum and knows it must move fast, Western weapons supplies permitting. Battle lines will harden when freezing weather comes. The window for reclaiming more territory this winter may close in a few weeks. </Text></Article><Article author="By Laurence Peter and Matt Murphy"><Text>Ukrainian troops have retaken more territory in regions illegally annexed by Russia, with Kyiv's forces advancing near the southern city of Kherson and consolidating gains in the east. Russian-installed officials in Kherson confirmed the advance, but said Moscow's forces were digging in.Ukrainian troops also moved towards Russian-held Luhansk in the east.Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said "there are new liberated settlements in several regions".Speaking during his nightly address, President Zelensky said "fierce fighting continues in many areas", but he did not give details. The progress of Ukraine's counterattacks have been closely guarded and reporters have largely been kept away from the front lines.But in the south, Vladimir Saldo, the Russian-installed leader in the Kherson region, admitted that Ukrainian forces had broken through near Dudchany, a town on the Dnipro river about 30km (20 miles) south of the previous front line. The river is called Dnieper by Russians."There are settlements that are occupied by Ukrainian forces," Mr Saldo said. Some Russian reports say the Ukrainians have now taken Dudchany.Russian defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said "numerically superior" Ukrainian tanks had "driven a deep wedge" south of Zolota Balka, a village that marked the previous front line on the Dnipro. He claimed the Russians had killed about 130 Ukrainian troops in that fighting.According to Mr Saldo, two Ukrainian battalions tried to reach the Kakhovka hydroelectric station, about 70km (44 miles) east of Kherson. The power station is in the port city of Nova Kakhovka. The Ukrainian advance is targeting supply lines for as many as 25,000 Russian troops on the west bank of the Dnipro, Reuters news agency reports.Meanwhile, in the east, Kyiv's troops have continued an advance that has made inroads into Luhansk, a province annexed by Moscow last week and previously under almost complete Russian control. On Saturday, Ukrainian forces recaptured the important hub town of Lyman in the east, near the Luhansk regional border. Russia's military had turned Lyman into a logistical base.A commander of Russia's proxy forces in Luhansk said Ukrainian troops had pushed a few kilometres into the region before being killed. The BBC cannot confirm these claims. And reports suggest that the Ukrainians are moving towards the Russian-held towns of Kreminna and Svatove in Luhansk, with some pro-Kremlin bloggers suggesting that Russian forces have again been ordered to retreat.Kherson and Luhansk are among four regions which Russian President Vladimir Putin has declared to be part of Russia, following so-called referendums denounced as fraudulent by Kyiv and its Western allies. Russia does not fully control any of the four regions.On Monday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov attracted ridicule online after he admitted that Russia was still deciding which areas it had "annexed", suggesting that Moscow does not know where its self-declared borders are. Mr Peskov claimed the entirety of Luhansk and Donetsk regions were part of Russia, but said the Kremlin would "continue consultations with the population regarding the borders of the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions". Kyiv has vowed to retake all the territory annexed by Russia, including Crimea, seized by Russian troops in 2014.The Russian defence ministry says reservists drafted under Mr Putin's mobilisation order last month are undergoing intensive combat training in the Russian-controlled Luhansk and Donetsk regions. The Kremlin plans to call up about 300,000 reservists - though Mr Putin did not set an upper limit.ANALYSIS: Who is winning the war in Ukraine?ON THE GROUND: What weapons are being supplied to Ukraine?READ MORE: Full coverage of the crisis</Text></Article><Article author="By David Gritten"><Text>Schoolgirls in Iran have been waving their headscarves in the air and chanting against clerical authorities, in an unprecedented show of support for the protests engulfing the country.Videos verified by the BBC showed demonstrations inside schoolyards and on the streets of several cities.They echoed the wider unrest sparked by the death last month of a woman who was detained for breaking the hijab law.In Karaj, girls reportedly forced an education official out of their school.Footage posted on social media on Monday showed them shouting "shame on you" and throwing what appear to be empty water bottles at the man until he retreats through a gate.The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterIn another video from Karaj, which is just to the west of the capital Tehran, students are heard shouting: "If we don't unite, they will kill us one by one." In the southern city of Shiraz on Monday, dozens of schoolgirls blocked traffic on a main road while waving their headscarves in the air and shouting "death to the dictator" - a reference to the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the final say on all state matters.The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterFurther protests by schoolgirls were reported on Tuesday in Karaj, Tehran and the north-western cities of Saqez and Sanandaj.A number of students were also photographed standing in their classrooms with their heads uncovered. Some were raising their middle fingers - an obscene gesture - at portraits of Ayatollah Khamenei and the founder of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.Analysis by Rana Rahimpour, BBC PersianAfter almost three weeks of protests, it is clear that Iran's leadership is facing a serious challenge. Its opponents are no longer just politicians or people in their 20s. It is now facing teenagers - schoolgirls who are not scared of burning photos of the supreme leader.The protests have continued despite Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's warning on Monday that they were "riots" orchestrated by the West. Many of those taking part simply want a normal life. They might not understand politics, but they understand that they are not free to live their lives the way they want. Now, every school and university could potentially become a headquarters for the protesters. Every day at school, teenagers will be able to get together and exchange ideas about how to overthrow the regime. The question is whether and how the Islamic Republic will be able to stop them. The protests by the schoolgirls began hours after Ayatollah Khamenei, who has final say on all state matters, broke his silence on the unrest and accused the United States and Israel, Iran's arch-enemies, of orchestrating "riots".  He also gave his full backing to the security forces, which have responded to the protests with a violent crackdown.The unrest was triggered by the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish woman who fell into a coma after being detained by morality police on 13 September in Tehran for allegedly violating the law requiring women to cover their hair with a hijab, or headscarf. She died in hospital three days later.Her family has alleged that officers beat her head with a baton and banged her head against one of their vehicles. The police have denied that she was mistreated and said she suffered "sudden heart failure".The first protests took place in Kurdish-populated north-western Iran, where Ms Amini lived, and then spread rapidly across the country. Iran Human Rights, a Norway-based group, reported on Tuesday that at least 154 people had been killed by security forces so far. They include 63 protesters whom ethnic Baluch activists said had died in clashes in the south-eastern city of Zahedan on Friday.</Text></Article><Article author="By Elsa Maishman"><Text>At least four people have been killed and dozens are missing after an avalanche struck a team of mountaineers high in the Indian Himalayas.The 34 trainees and seven instructors were practising navigation when they were hit on their descent from a peak in the northern state of Uttarakhand. Eight of the party are believed to have been rescued and the rest are trapped in a crevasse, rescuers say.Search efforts have been paused for the night because of rain and snowfall.Local media reports say the number of casualties may rise significantly. The group was made up of trainees from the nearby Nehru Institute of Mountaineering. It said they had been returning from Mount Draupadi Danda-2 (5,670m; 18,602 feet) when the avalanche struck. Authorities were alerted at around 09:30 local time on Tuesday (04:00 GMT), rescue workers said. "We have confirmation of four deaths out of the 33 people trapped. Around eight of them have already been rescued and the rest are trapped in a crevasse," Ridhim Aggarwal from the State Disaster Response Force told AFP news agency. Rescue efforts will continue as long as the weather allows, he said. Earlier, Uttarakhand police chief Ashok Kumar told Reuters news agency: "The Indian Air Force is doing an aerial recce of the mountain where this happened. It is not easy to reach the spot." Defence Minister Rajnath Singh wrote on Twitter: "Deeply anguished by the loss of precious lives due to landslide which has struck the mountaineering expedition carried out by the Nehru Mountaineering Institute in Uttarkashi."It comes a week after the body of famed US ski mountaineer Hilaree Nelson was found in the Nepali Himalayas. Ms Nelson, regarded as one of the greatest mountaineers of her generation, was reported to have fallen into a deep crevasse after reaching the summit of Mount Manaslu.On the same day she went missing, one person was killed and more than a dozen injured in an avalanche lower down on the same peak.</Text></Article><Article author="By Hugh Schofield"><Text>Paris has become the latest French city to announce that it will not be setting up giant screens and fan zones for the approaching World Cup in Qatar.It cited human rights and environmental concerns in the host nation.Lille, Marseille, Bordeaux, Strasbourg and Reims are also boycotting the competition on ethical grounds.Pierre Rabadan, in charge of sport at Paris City Hall, said the fact the event was taking place in winter was also a factor in the city's decision.The movement began on Saturday after the Socialist mayor of Lille, Martine Aubry, declared that the Qatar World Cup was a "nonsense in terms of human rights, the environment and sport".Like other mayors - of both left and right - she blamed concerns over workers' rights in Qatar; the alleged high number of deaths among foreign labourers; and the environmental impact of the stadiums, all equipped with outdoor air conditioning.In Marseille, there had been plans for a giant screening if France made it to the final, but that has now been cancelled.The city's Socialist mayor, Benoit Payan, said the competition "had progressively turned itself into a human and environmental catastrophe, incompatible with the values which we expect sport - and especially football - to promote".It was unclear how many French cities were actually making preparations for outdoor venues where supporters could follow the progress of the French team, world champions in Russia 2018.The mayor of Angoulême in south-west France said his decision was as much financial as to do with human rights in Qatar.Why is the Qatar World Cup so controversial?FA criticised for 'delay' over Qatar statement"It seemed incongruous to us to risk this kind of expense at a time when we are trying to make economies to absorb the growing cost of energy," said Xavier Bonnefont, citing a giant screen cost of "several tens of thousands of euros"."In any case frankly in winter I don't think there would have been many people turning up. The public will be just as happy in a bar."Calls for a boycott of the World Cup, which takes place between 21 November and 18 December, have been growing in France, though they remain far from mainstream.The former international and Manchester United star Eric Cantona said he would not be watching any matches, adding: "Let's be honest, this World Cup makes no sense. It is an aberration."Government spokesman Olivier Véran said: "If we were to make the decision today, we would not give the World Cup to Qatar.  However when something was decided 10 years ago by 100 countries, it's difficult to say stop just a few weeks before it gets under way."</Text></Article><Article author="BBC News"><Text>Twitter shares have been suspended following a report that Elon Musk will proceed with a takeover of the social media platform.Mr Musk is set to buy Twitter at the original price he offered months ago before he walked away from a deal, sources told US media.Shares in Twitter were up almost 13% before trading was halted.Mr Musk was due to face Twitter in court later this month after he tried to pull out of the takeover.Mr Musk offered to pay $54.20 per share for the company in April, in a deal that valued the social media platform at $44bn.But he balked at the deal just a few weeks later, citing concerns that the number of bots on the platform was higher than Twitter claimed.Twitter denied the accusations and sued Mr Musk to force the deal to go through.The back-and-forth came amid a sharp downturn in the value of technology stocks, including Tesla, the electric car company that Mr Musk leads and is the base of much of his wealth. Twitter accused Mr Musk of wanting out because he was worried about the price.The fight between Mr Musk and Twitter, which was scheduled to go to trial 17 October, had ensnarled many of the biggest names in tech, as lawyers for the two companies demanded communications about the deal.Mr Musk, who could have paid a $1bn break-up fee to walk away from the deal, was set to be interviewed ahead of the trial this week.Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said Mr Musk's chance of winning was "highly unlikely"."Being forced to do the deal after a long and ugly court battle in Delaware was not an ideal scenario and instead accepting this path and moving forward with the deal will save a massive legal headache," he wrote in a report after the news.But he added, that Mr Musk's ownership of the platform, a top venue for politicians and journalists to spread news and opinion, would still likely to cause a "firestorm of worries and questions" in Washington and beyond.It's never dull with Musk. Elon Musk has for months now been trying to get out of this deal. In doing so he has argued that Twitter is full of bots.He has said on multiple occasions that Twitter may have many times more fake accounts than it admits to.By making these claims he has helped to tarnish the reputation of the company.Advertisers are nervous - they want to buy ads that are seen by humans, with wallets, not bots.So for Elon Musk to then offer to buy the company again, at the initial price, seems bizarre.Twitter is reportedly looking at Mr Musk's offer closely. Musk's behaviour in this deal has so far been erratic. Could this be a legal strategy to delay a court case?But if this reported offer is credible it's a massive win for Twitter's shareholders and its lawyers. Many Twitter employees, however, will be less pleased. I've spoken to several employees who are privately nervous about a Musk takeover, and what that might mean for moderation policies - and more acutely - their own job security.And as for Twitter's CEO Parag Agrawal? Well emails disclosed last week suggests he doesn't get along well with Musk.A Musk Twitter takeover would almost certainly mean a new person in charge of the company.</Text></Article><Article author="BBC News"><Text>A Nigerian boy has been killed by his brother while testing a newly bought "bullet-proof" charm, police say.The two believed they had "fortified themselves with the protective charm", according to police in Kwara stateAbubakar Abubakar then shot at his younger brother Yusuf, 12, using their father's rifle, officers say.

He was then arrested for kicking an officer while in custody.Gilman told the court in Voronezh, south-western Russia, that he did not remember the incident but "apologised to Russia" and to the officer.After being found guilty, Gilman - 28 and from Massachusetts - said the sentence requested by the prosecution was too strict.The lawyers told TASS, the Russian state news agency, that Gilman was in Russia to study and obtain citizenship. Gilman was reportedly staying in Sochi, but headed by train to Moscow to replace his damaged passport at the US Embassy.His lawyers said they would appeal against the court's decision and contact US officials to seek a prisoner exchange.There have been several high-profile cases of Americans being sentenced to lengthy prison terms in Russia recently. This could lead to prisoner swaps, a process often seen as "hostage diplomacy", where countries try to use people as bargaining chips. Another ex-marine, Trevor Reed, was freed in April in a prisoner swap after being found guilty of violence against a police officer on a night out in Russia.And another former US marine, Paul Whelan, is serving 16 years for spying charges after a short trial was conducted entirely behind closed doors.He maintains his innocence, and describes himself the victim of "greasy, slimy Russian politics".How Brittney Griner's case throws spotlight on hostage diplomacyUS basketball star Brittney Griner was sentenced to nine years in prison on drug charges by a Russian court in August.The double Olympic winner admitted possessing cannabis oil, but told the court she had made an "honest mistake".The US claims she's being wrongfully detained. It is unclear how long she will spend behind bars, as the US and Russia have reportedly discussed a prisoner swap involving Russian arms trafficker, Viktor Bout. </Text></Article><Article author="By Mark Savage"><Text>Loretta Lynn, whose songs of strength and independence made her a standard-bearer for women in country music, has died at the age of 90.Known as the Queen of Country, her songs were rooted in real-life experience, most notably on the autobiographical Coal Miner's Daughter.Other hits included Don't Come Home A-Drinkin', Honky Tonk Girl and the feminist anthem, The Pill.Lynn's family said she died on Tuesday at her home in Tennessee."Our precious mom, Loretta Lynn, passed away peacefully this morning, October 4th, in her sleep at home in her beloved ranch in Hurricane Mills," the family said in a statement. They asked for privacy as they grieve and said a memorial would be announced later.  The singer was born Loretta Webb in a one-room log cabin in Butcher Hollow, Kentucky in 1932. She was the second of eight children.Just as she would later sing in Coal Miner's Daughter, her family eked out a living during the Depression, with her father earning a "poor man's dollar" by working all night in the coal mines, and all day in the fields "a-hoein' corn".The family made its own entertainment - her mother played guitar, with her father accompanying on banjo - and she grew up on the songs of the Carter Family."I was singing when I was born, I think," she told the Associated Press in 2016. "Daddy used to come out on the porch where I would be singing and rocking the babies to sleep. "He'd say, 'Loretta, shut that big mouth. People all over this holler can hear you.' And I said, 'Daddy, what difference does it make? They are all my cousins.'"At the age of 15, she attended a "pie social" - where local girls would bake a pie, and men would bid to win both the food and a meeting with the cook. Loretta's pie, accidentally baked with salt instead of sugar, was won by Oliver Lynn, a 21-year-old solider, who swept her off her feet. A month later, they married and moved to Custer, Washington, where they raised four children.Her husband, whom she called "Doo" or "Doolittle," urged her to sing professionally and bought her a $17 (£15) Sears guitar, with which she started a band, Loretta and the Trailblazers, that also featured her brother Jay Lee Webb.By 1960, she had signed a contract with Zero Records and released her debut single, I'm a Honky Tonk Girl. The song was inspired by a woman Lynn befriended in Washington, whose husband had left her for another woman. Lynn said she wrote the song while leaning up against an old toilet in her house, the words pouring out of her in a 10-minute burst of inspiration.She and her husband promoted the song relentlessly, driving to radio stations around the country to pester DJs into playing it, and sending out hundreds of free discs.The effort paid off. I'm A Honky Tonk Girl reached number 14 on the country charts, and Lynn relocated to Nashville, where she was quickly snapped up by Decca Records. She released her first Decca record, Success, in 1962, beginning an impressive stretch of hits that continued into the 1990s.Lynn earned her first number one with Don't Come Home a Drinkin' (With Lovin' on Your Mind) in 1966, and topped the US country charts another 15 times. She recorded 60 albums in total, and was nominated for 18 Grammy Awards, winning three.Her songs frequently depicted broken relationships and unhappy homes - but were unusual for expressing a female point of view at a time when that was unheard of in country music. Many addressed Doolittle's infidelity and alcoholism. You Ain't Woman Enough (To Take My Man) and Fist City were feisty warnings to any woman who considered approaching her husband, while 1971's I Wanna Be Free fantasised about divorce. "I'm gonna take this chain from around my finger / And throw it just as far as I can sling," sang Lynn."I've wrote every song I ever wrote about him," she told a BBC Arena documentary. "He gave me a lot of opportunities."Lynn later confessed that the relationship could turn violent - although she gave as good as she got."If he smacked me or anything, I'd stand up and be fightin' him just like I'd be fightin' the other woman," she told PBS's American Masters documentary in 2016. "He'd smack me, I'd smack him; he'd pull my hair, I pulled his hair. That's the way it was." Despite their troubles, the couple stayed together for 48 years until Oliver's death in 1996.Lynn's songs weren't just about relationships, however. Dear Sam was inspired by the women left at home during the Vietnam War, with lyrics that ran: "Don't misunderstand/ I know he's fighting for our land / I really love my country/ But I also love my man", while The Pill was a frank and funny celebration of reproductive choice. "This old maternity dress I've got is going in the garbage/The clothes I'm wearing from now on won't take up so much yardage," sang the star. "Miniskirts, hot pants and a few little fancy frills/Yeah, I'm making up for all those years since I've got the pill."Although she wasn't initially credited as a writer, it later transpired she had played a part in its composition. Speaking to NPR in 2010, the mother of six said the lyrics spoke directly to her own experiences."If I'd had [the pill] I would have used it," she said. "'Cause back when I was having all the kids, we didn't have birth-control pills. Or if we did, I didn't know anything about them."The subject matter meant her record label held the single back for several years. When it was finally released in 1975, many country radio stations refused to play it, keeping it from hitting number one. But it still reached the top five, and became Lynn's biggest crossover pop hit.By that time, Lynn had begun a professional partnership with country star Conway Twitty, with whom she scored hits like After the Fire Is Gone, Louisiana Woman, Mississippi Man and As Soon As I Hang Up The Phone. The musicians were named vocal duo of the year by the Country Music Association for four consecutive years from 1972 to 1975.Lynn published her autobiography, also called Coal Miner's Daughter, in 1976, and it was turned into a film in 1980, earning Sissy Spacek an Oscar for best actress.The musician's output slowed in the 1980s and she announced her retirement in the 1990s - although she still managed to release a handful of albums, including 1993's Honky Tonk Women, a collaboration with fellow country music trailblazers Dolly Parton and Tammy Wynette. In the meantime, she turned her attention to food, launching a restaurant called Loretta Lynn's Kitchen, and a series of cookbooks that mixed recipes with stories from her life.She also opened the Loretta Lynn Ranch in Tennessee - Lynn's equivalent to Parton's Dollywood - which hosts a museum and campsite, and stages regular music events. In 2004, her career was resurrected by super-fan Jack White, who encouraged her back into the studio for an album that combined his abrasive rock sound with Lynn's penchant for pedal steel and banjo.The album showed that her narrative power was undiminished (one song, Ms Leroy Brown, told of a bored housewife who stole her husband's savings to rent a limousine and go on a bender) and gained her a new audience at the age of 72, as well as the Grammy Award for best country album.In 2013, Lynn was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honour in the United States, by President Barack Obama.Later albums included Full Circle, a mix of new songs and remakes of old standards, and 2021's Still Woman Enough, which saw her duet with Margo Price and Tanya Tucker.Lynn stopped touring in 2017 after a stroke, and suffered a broken hip after falling over at home the following year. But she continued to perform and record, and forcefully denied tabloid reports at the time that her health was failing."Through the years they've said I'm broke, homeless, cheating, drinking, gone crazy, terminally ill, and even dead! Poor things can't ever get it right," she wrote on Facebook. "I guess if those old pesky tabloids are harassing me then they're giving someone else a break... but I'm about an inch from taking 'em to Fist City!"It was that down-to-earth gutsiness that endeared her to fans over the last six decades, and one that ensures her music still feels relevant."I like real life, because that's what we're doing today," she said 2004. "And I think that's why people bought my records, because they're living in this world and so am I. So I see what's going on, and I grab it."Lynn is survived by four of her six children: Clara, Ernest and twins Peggy and Patsy, as well as 17 grandchildren and four step-grandchildren.</Text></Article><Article author="By Jean Mackenzie, Yvette Tan &amp; Rupert Wingfield-Hayes"><Text>North Korea has fired a ballistic missile over Japan, in what appears to be a deliberate escalation to get the attention of Tokyo and Washington.The missile travelled 4,500km (2,800 miles) before falling into the Pacific Ocean - far enough to hit the US island of Guam if it took another trajectory.It is the North's first missile launch over Japan since 2017. Japan issued an alert to some citizens to take cover.The US, Japan and South Korea conducted their own military drills in response.South Korean and US aircraft fired at a mock target on an uninhabited island in the Yellow Sea, while the US and Japan also jointly carried out drills over the Sea of Japan.The UN prohibits North Korea from testing ballistic and nuclear weapons. Flying missiles towards or over other countries without any warning or consultation also contravenes international norms. Most countries avoid doing it completely as it can easily be mistaken for an attack. While it is not as big as a nuclear test - which could be next - it can be considered hugely provocative.People in the north of Japan, including Hokkaido island and Aomori city, reportedly woke up to the noise of sirens and text alerts which read: "North Korea appears to have launched a missile. Please evacuate into buildings or underground."As the missile flew overhead, they were warned to look out for falling debris. Many remained calm, though, with one video showing Tokyo commuters walking normally as loudspeakers blared out warnings. But others were more shaken. "If a missile hit, I was worried it would be a big problem not only here but also nationwide," Aomori resident Kazuko Ebina told the Asahi Shimbun newspaper.Officials later said the intermediate-range ballistic missile fell into the Pacific Ocean far from Japan, and there were no reported injuries.It had covered the longest distance ever travelled by a North Korean missile, and reached a height of around 1,000km - higher than the International Space Station. Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida described the launch as "violent behaviour", while defence minister Yasukazu Hamada said Japan would not rule out any options to strengthen its defences including "counterattack capabilities". US President Joe Biden reinforced Washington's "ironclad commitment" to Japan's defence during a phone call with Mr Kishida, while the two leaders jointly condemned the missile test, a White House statement said.They confirmed they would work closely with South Korea and the international community to coordinate an immediate and longer-term response to the threat posed by the North, it added.Last week, the three countries conducted naval exercises together for the first time since 2017. Such drills have long antagonised Pyongyang leader Kim Jong-un, who views them as proof that his enemies are preparing for war. Following the combined exercises in 2017, North Korea fired two missiles over Japan in response. A week later, it conducted a nuclear test.Recent intelligence has suggested that North Korea is getting ready to test another nuclear weapon.It is expected that North Korea would wait until after China - its main ally - holds its Communist party congress later this month.But some experts are now asking if it could come sooner than expected - they believe Tuesday's launch shows that North Korea is preparing the ground for a nuclear test.N Korea missile tests: What does Kim Jong-un want?What missiles does North Korea have?North Korea tests banned intercontinental missile The missile launch is the fifth carried out by Pyongyang in a week. On Saturday, two rockets came down in waters outside Japan's exclusive economic zone. Many of North Korea's missile tests are conducted on a high, lofted flight path - reaching a high altitude, avoiding flights over its neighbours.But firing over or past Japan allows North Korean scientists to test missiles under circumstances "that are more representative of the conditions they'd endure in real-world use", analyst Ankit Panda told news agency Reuters.These actions have contributed to enduring tensions between North Korea and Japan, rooted in Japan's colonisation of Korea from 1910 to 1945 and the North's abduction of Japanese citizens in the past.Earlier this month, North Korea passed a law declaring itself to be a nuclear weapons state, with leader Kim Jong-un ruling out the possibility of talks on denuclearisation. Pyongyang conducted six nuclear tests between 2006 and 2017, incurring widespread sanctions. The East Asian state regularly defies the ban on nuclear and missile tests, saying it needs to bolster its defences.Additional reporting by Nathan Williams. </Text></Article><Article author="BBC News"><Text>North Korea has fired a missile over Japan, which travelled about 4,500km (2,800 miles) before falling into the Pacific Ocean.It has been conducting regular missile tests as part of its weapons programme, but this is the first launch over Japan since 2017.North Korea has carried out more than 30 missile tests this year - using some with a long enough range to reach the US. These include ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and hypersonic missiles.Hypersonic missiles fly at several times the speed of sound and at low altitude, to escape radar detection. The latest missile tested over Japan is thought to be an intermediate-range Hwasong-12, which has a range of 4,500km - far enough to hit the US island of Guam from North Korea."North Korea has been testing missiles with longer and longer ranges," says Joseph Byrne, research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute."This is the longest-range missile it's ever fired over Japan. It could be the precursor to it testing another nuclear warhead, which has been predicted for some time." North Korea has also been testing the Hwasong-14 ballistic missile.This has a range of 8,000km - although some studies have suggested it could travel as far as 10,000km, making it capable of reaching New York.It is the first of North Korea's intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). The Hwasong-15 missile is believed to have a range of 13,000km, putting all of the continental US in its sights.In October 2020, North Korea unveiled the latest of its ballistic missiles - the Hwasong-17. It is believed to have a range of 15,000km or more.It could possibly carry three or four warheads, rather than only one - making it harder for a nation to defend itself.The unveiling of the new missiles appeared to be a message to the Biden administration of the North's growing military prowess, say experts.In March 2021, it carried out a launch of what it called a "new-type tactical guided projectile", which it said was able to carry a payload of 2.5 tons - so capable of in theory of carrying a nuclear warhead. Analysts at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies told Reuters that it appeared to be "an improved variant" of a previously tested missile, the KN-23. The last time North Korea tested a nuclear bomb was in 2017. The explosion at its Punggye-ri test site had a force, or "yield", of between 100-370 kilotons. A 100 kiloton bomb is six times more powerful than the one the US dropped on Hiroshima in 1945.North Korea claimed this was its first thermonuclear device - the most powerful of all types of atomic weapon.However, North Korea may now be aiming to test a smaller type of nuclear warhead with similar explosive force, according to Mr Byrne. "It seems they are now testing a new capability - a miniaturised warhead that can be fitted onto a range of missiles, including short-range missiles" he says. Six underground tests have previously been carried out at Punggye-ri. However, in 2018 North Korea said it would shut the site down, because it had "verified" its nuclear capabilities.Some of the tunnels into the site were subsequently blown up in the presence of foreign journalists. However, North Korea did not invite international experts to verify if it had been put beyond use.Satellite images released earlier this year suggest work to renovate Punggye-ri had started.Any future nuclear testing at the site would breach resolutions from the United Nations Security Council.In 2018, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un made a promise to then-US president Donald Trump that North Korea would destroy all its nuclear material enrichment facilities.However, the UN's atomic agency says satellite images suggest that North Korea had restarted the reactor which makes its weapons-grade plutonium.The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has also said that North Korea's nuclear programme is going "full steam ahead," with work on plutonium separation, uranium enrichment and other activities.Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questions</Text></Article><Article author="By Nadine  Yousif"><Text>Former US President Donald Trump nearly fired his daughter and routinely flushed documents down the toilet.These explosive details and more are revealed in New York Times journalist Maggie Haberman's highly-anticipated book Confidence Man, which is released on Tuesday. The book follows Mr Trump from his time as a New York businessman to his life after the presidency. It draws from interviews with more than 200 sources, including former aides as well as three interviews with Mr Trump himself. The former president has attacked Haberman, writing on his social media platform that the book contains "many made up stories with zero fact checking".Here are eight of Confidence Man's biggest revelations:At a meeting with then Chief of Staff John Kelly and then White House counsel Don McGahn, Haberman writes that Mr Trump was close to tweeting that his daughter, Ivanka, and son-in-law Jared Kushner - both senior White House aides - were leaving their positions. He was stopped by Mr Kelly, who advised him to speak with Ivanka and Mr Kushner first before sending the tweet. Mr Trump never spoke with them, and they both remained White House aides until the end of his presidency. The book also reveals that Mr Trump frequently talked down on his son-in-law, and once commented that Mr Kushner "sounds like a child" after hearing a public speech he gave in 2017. Mr Trump has denied ever wanting to fire Ivanka and her husband. "Pure fiction. Never even crossed my mind," he said.Haberman writes that Mr Trump raised the prospect of bombing Mexican drug labs several times - a suggestion that stunned former US Defence Secretary Mark Esper. The idea stemmed from a conversation that Mr Trump had with Brett Giroir, a public health officer and an admiral with the US Public Health Service Commissioned Corps.Mr Giroir walked into the Oval Office wearing a dress uniform - as is customary for public health officers in the corps - and said to Mr Trump that facilities producing illegal drugs in Mexico should be handled by putting "a lead to target" to stop illicit substances from coming over the border.Mistaking Mr Giroir for a military officer, Mr Trump then suggested bombing the drug facilities. In response, the White House asked Mr Giroir to stop wearing his uniform. When Mr Trump fell ill with Covid-19 in October 2020, his condition at the White House was worsening and he was fearful of dying.  At one point, his deputy chief of staff, Tony Ornato, warned the president that if his health deteriorated further he would have to set in motion procedures to ensure the continuity of government. This fear existed despite several attempts by Mr Trump to minimize the pandemic, as he worried the virus was negatively impacting his image and political motivations. Haberman writes that he asked aides around him to take off their masks, and that he advised then New York governor Andrew Cuomo to not talk about the virus on TV. "Don't make such a big deal out of this," Mr Trump said to Mr Cuomo, according to the book. "You're going to make it a problem."Haberman's book details several encounters between Mr Trump and world leaders. For instance, in his first meeting with then UK Prime Minister Theresa May, Mr Trump spoke about abortion, saying "some people are pro-life, some people are pro-choice. Imagine if some animals with tattoos raped your daughter and she got pregnant?"He then changed the subject in a conversation on Northern Ireland to discuss how to block an offshore wind project from being set up near his property. When it became apparent that Mr Trump was losing the 2020 election to US President Joe Biden, he called former New York City mayor and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani."Okay, Rudy, you're in charge. Go wild, do anything you want. I don't care," Mr Trump said, after other lawyers refused to go as far as he has requested in his bid to overturn the election results. "My lawyers are terrible," he said to Mr Giuliani, according to the book. He also frequently berated White House counsel Pat Cipollone. The book reveals that at the time, Mr Trump was enamoured with conspiracy theories and sought out lawyers that his own advisers felt were deluded.On a plane while campaigning in 2016, Mr Trump was asked by his campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and his press secretary Hope Hicks to address his refusal to release his tax returns - an issue they saw as a problem for Mr Trump's White House bid.Haberman writes that Mr Trump responded by leaning back before snapping to a sudden thought: "Well, you know my taxes are under audit, I always get audited," he said. "So what I mean is, well I could just say, 'I'll release them when I'm no longer under audit. 'Cause I'll never not be under audit." Since Richard Nixon, every US president has voluntarily released their tax returns. A 2020 New York Times investigation has since revealed that Mr Trump paid $750 (£662) in federal income taxes the year he became president. When Mr Trump was in office, White House staff periodically discovered that the toilet was clogged with printed paper and believed he had flushed documents.He also allegedly tore up documents, which contravenes the Presidential Records Act - a law that says documents created or received by a president are the property of the US government and are to be handled by the US National Archives once the presidency ends.The details are revealed amid wider allegations of missing documents from Mr Trump's White House levelled by the National Archives. Mr Trump also faces a criminal investigation by the Department of Justice for keeping government records at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida after leaving office.At a congressional meeting shortly after his 2017 inauguration, Haberman writes that Mr Trump turned to a racially diverse group of Democratic staffers and asked them to fetch canapes, mistaking them for waiters.The book details that Mr Trump made the remarks to staffers for Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Nancy Pelosi. Haberman also documents a history of homophobic remarks allegedly uttered by Mr Trump. </Text></Article><Article author="BBC News"><Text>Four women have been selected to run the world's most remote post office and count penguins in Antarctica.Clare Ballantyne, Mairi Hilton, Natalie Corbett and Lucy Bruzzone beat a record number of applicants to become the team responsible for managing historic site Port Lockroy, on Goudier Island.The team will travel 9,000 miles from the UK to reopen the bay for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic.They will spend five months without running water or a flushing toilet.Newlywed Ms Corbett, in charge of running the gift shop at the site's museum, will leave behind her husband for the trip, which she dubbed a "solo honeymoon".The 31-year-old from Hampshire said she could not resist the opportunity to work on the island."Who wouldn't want to spend five months working on an island filled with penguins in one of the most remote places on the planet?" she said.As well as dealing with sub-zero temperatures and almost constant daylight, the women will share the island with a colony of gentoo penguins, which Ms Hilton will be in charge of monitoring."This will be my first time in Antarctica and I'm very excited to set eyes on the white continent. I have no idea what to expect when we get there - how cold it will be, will we have to dig our way through the snow to the post office?" Ms Hilton, from Bo'ness, near Falkirk in Scotland, said."I'm a conservation biologist, so personally I can't wait to see the penguins and other wildlife like seabirds and whales."The four women were among 6,000 people who expressed an interest in the roles, which were advertised by the UK Antarctic Heritage Trust (UKAHT) charity.Newly appointed postmaster Ms Ballantyne, from Lincolnshire, has just completed a masters in earth science at Oxford University.The 23-year-old will deal by hand with approximately 80,000 cards, which are mailed each year from the site to more than 100 countries.Ms Bruzzone will be base leader, managing the team and coordinating all ship visits to the island.The scientist, who has already spent three months in the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard on an Arctic expedition, described the opportunity as a "lifelong dream".The women will be joined for the first 10 weeks by 42-year-old Vicky Inglis, from Aberdeenshire, who was a UKAHT general assistant in the 2019/20 season.

It takes less than five minutes to get there, but the last 50 metres must be covered on foot through thick, spiky vegetation, some of it chest-high.  The two men flee as the unit approaches, leaving behind them the half-prepared boat, the fuel and motor, and two sacks of life-jackets."The vegetation works against us," General Frantz Tavart told me. "The smugglers know this and stash the boats here on purpose."The UK drones are valuable, he says, because they spot even well-hidden sites like this one."The drone caught this," he said. "The [surveillance] plane passed over beforehand and didn't spot it, because it was hidden by the trees."This 160km stretch of coastline has sucked in resources, year after year. France and the UK have invested in more patrols, better technology and different kinds of vehicles. And still the numbers crossing the Channel keep growing.Britain's new home secretary, Suella Braverman, will give a speech at the Conservative's party conference later where she's expected to restate her determination to crack down on the arrivals.French patrols say they're stopping around half of all crossing attempts, but more than 30,000 people have still made it to the UK so far this year.And it's not just migrants who are finding this route increasingly attractive. New smuggling networks have been reported this summer too.A senior French official with good knowledge of the situation told us that dedicated Albanian smuggling networks are now operating across the Channel, separately from the main Kurdish and Iraqi networks."[The Albanian networks] are more efficient than the others," he told us. "40% of those we intercept on this side of the Channel are Albanian; but they make up 60% of those who arrive on the other side.""Our hypothesis is that they're a lot more experienced than the others in terms of criminal activity, and more used to organising themselves and avoiding the police. We find the prices are higher for Albanian networks than for the others."General Tavart says he can't confirm whether the new Albanian smuggling routes are being run by established criminal groups, perhaps based in the UK, but he says it would make sense."With the price of a crossing around 4,000 euros (£3,482), and around 40 people in one boat, do the maths," he said.  "It's extremely lucrative, even more so than drug trafficking, and the criminal charges are lighter."Some have suggested that shortages in the labour market post-Brexit are adding to the 'pull-factors' attracting both smugglers and their clients.Larger numbers of Albanians have been seen at the main migrant camp in Dunkerque, but most seem to stay in hotels around the area, or in Paris or Brussels.At one hotel in Dunkerque, the landlady confirmed she now had a large number of Albanian clients passing through.  The owner of a bar across the street from the station said that on some days half his customers are Albanian."I wonder if there's anyone left in Albania," he said, "seeing how many of them are coming through here."The rise in migrants crossing the Channel, and the appearance of new smuggling networks, seems to challenge the government's strategy of deterrence.For months, the UK government has been promising to send some of those who arrive in small boats to Rwanda, where their asylum claims will be processed, and where they will be expected to settle if their claim is successful.On the road outside Calais, in the small hours of the morning, we met 17-year-old Sikunder and his friends, wrapped in survival blankets that glinted like pieces of silver in the dark.They are all from Afghanistan, they said, and had just been rescued from a sinking boat by the French police.I asked Sikunder whether he was aware that the UK might send him to Rwanda."I have heard about it," he replied, "but some of my relatives in the UK told us the plan was finished, and we can come to the UK."It was his second attempt at crossing; he's determined it won't be his last.The UK government is currently fighting a court battle over the legality of its Rwanda policy. In the camps around Calais, almost everyone is aware of the risk, and almost everyone finds a way to rationalise it away.Biniam is a softly-spoken 28-year-old man from the Tigray region in Ethiopia. In fluent English, he told me he had a Masters degree in manufacturing, and that he wanted to claim asylum in the UK because he had seen how the British government had spoken out strongly against the violent conflict in Tigray."The UK understands the situation in my country," he told me. "So that's why I will go."I ask him how afraid he is of being sent to Rwanda."100% afraid," he said. "If they return me to Africa, it will be easy for the government of Ethiopia to take me."More than one person here told me how the change of prime minister would mean the policy would be scrapped.There's little sign of that UK Prime Minister Liz Truss has so far been very supportive of it.Jess Sharman of Care4Calais says people are risking their lives to get to the UK, because they can't claim asylum while in France, and can't cross the Channel via official routes."They shouldn't be here, and it's only because of government policies that they are," she said. "And that could change overnight if Liz Truss could make it safe and legal for them to [claim asylum]."A lot can change overnight here in Calais.Camps are systematically destroyed by police units; violent conflicts erupt between smuggling gangs; security patrols race migrants for miles along the scrubby coastline; and - very often - as dawn breaks, another boatload of people from around the world end up on Britain's shores.</Text></Article><Article author="By Rajini Vaidyanathan"><Text>The United Nations has issued a new appeal for more than $800m (£700m) for flood-hit Pakistan. The funds, a five-fold increase on the previous request, would help families and children battle malnutrition and infection in what is now a public health emergency. It comes as the country struggles to cope after more than 2,000 hospitals and health centres were damaged or destroyed in recent floods, which left almost 1,700 people dead. Doctors like Ammara Gohar are on the front lines of the crisis as the UN launches a fresh appeal for the world to send more aid."It's very difficult for us. We attended to patients during Covid, but this is tougher because it involves environmental hazards," says Dr Ammara, a gynaecologist four years into her medical career.  She is working out of a school in rural Sindh province, the area worst affected in the floods, which has temporarily become the headquarters for the district health office after it was submerged. Here, Dr Ammara and her team load a van with boxes of medical supplies - everything from bandages to malaria tablets, hepatitis test kits to oral rehydration salts."We're taking this to people who've been completely cut off since the floods," she explains. Pakistan flood survivors battle rising tide of diseasePakistan floods: Images show huge scale of devastationWith around 75% of districts in Sindh province still flooded - and many roads underwater -  the only way people in isolated communities can access medical help is if it travels to them.So after an hour's drive, we reach the banks of a huge lake which a few months ago was fertile land that fed people in this area. Having swallowed their crops, it's now stagnant water where mosquitoes multiply, and a breeding ground for disease.Across the vast expanse live villagers who've been stranded for weeks."These people cannot survive without support in disaster-hit areas," Dr Ammara tells us.Her team of government doctors take to wooden boats to reach them, their efforts supported by the United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef). "This is a medical crisis," Unicef's Aadarsh Laghari tells us, as the medical team headed to a village needing help. "Access is one of the biggest problems - every day the medical needs of these communities are rising."In the first three weeks of September alone, more than 140,000 cases of malaria were reported in Sindh, health officials say. But with many people in far-flung areas unable to get tested, it's likely the true scale is much higher.And that's why mobile medical units are so urgently needed.After we reach the shore, the team set up a health camp under the shade of a tree on the edge of the village, where cows had earlier been taking shelter from the sun.A banner is hung from the branches to advertise the clinic; supplies which had been carried here by land and by water, are now being unpacked and laid out on plastic tables.As a tannoy announces the arrival of the medical staff, a steady stream of villagers arrive, many of them women carrying young children. The village of Noor Shah was already impoverished but the floods have pushed people right to the edge.As patients line up, a nurse measures the arm of baby Saima, with Dr Ammara looking on. The tape wound around her tiny arm moves to the red area of the scale, indicating that Saima is perilously thin."There are so many people like this baby," Dr Ammara says. "At just nine months old she's severely malnourished."Many families are sleeping in the open in flimsy tents next to homes which were washed away, or have crumbled to rock.Marooned for weeks, they're finally getting much needed medical help - but many say they're still waiting to get food and access to clean water to drink and wash with.At another village close by, three-year-old Gulbahar is examined by Dr Ammara. He has scabs on his face and body and is weak -  the result, Dr Ammara says, of drinking and washing with contaminated water.The UN says a lack of toilets has left people with no choice but to defecate in the same water, leading to outbreaks of illnesses. "Because of the floods we are seeing so many young children with these skin infections," Dr Ammara says, opening Gulbahar's mouth to examine his diseased gums.She hands his mother some medicines, but concedes her supplies will soon run out.While diseases spike, Pakistan's already overwhelmed healthcare system lacks the resources to help all those who need treatment. Boats are also in short supply, as are doctors - meaning efforts like this remain limited.Many people we met in these remote communities blame the government for not doing enough. Dr Azra Afzal Pechuho, the Sindh health minister, said: "It's like fighting a war which has no end to it. Until the water recedes, which is going to take another two, three months, we will still be seeing a lot of health issues."She has called for doctors to volunteer extra hours. "Ten days, three days, four days - whatever they feel they can give to the flood-affected areas," she told the BBC.Dr Ammara and her team are already working around the clock.  Without the camps, Dr Ammara fears people won't be able to survive."It hurts, it really hurts, I can't see people like this," she says. "I feel bad that we can't do more."</Text></Article><Article author="By Nduka Orjinmo"><Text>Jane Toku sheds no tears as she recalls the moment when she saw the smouldering remains of her son's corpse on the morning he and three of his friends were lynched 10 years ago.The four students had run into a local vigilante group at dawn in Aluu, a community behind the University of Port Harcourt in southern Nigeria's oil capital.There had been a spate of robberies in the area and at that time of the morning, people became suspicions. Accused of being petty thieves, the four - Llody Toku, Ugonna Obuzor, Chiadika Biringa and Tekena Elkanah - were given a mock trial and found guilty.Their punishment was handed out immediately: they were stripped, marched around the community, brutally beaten and set alight by the mob as thousands watched and filmed."When I arrived, I forced my way through the crowd and knelt before my son's corpse."His friend Tekena was barely breathing, I watched his chest heave with his last breaths," Mrs Toku said.Such mob killings are not uncommon in Nigeria but this was the first to go viral on social media, causing widespread outrage, protests and debates about the country's judicial system, and questions about a society where people resort to such levels of violence."One is tired and sick of coming here to lament after these dastardly acts," a lawmaker said at the time when the incident was discussed at the National Assembly."It is important for 'jungle justice' to be stopped - it is bad," said radio host Yaw, as celebrities condemned the incident.But despite the shock and anger over the killing of the students, now known as the Aluu Four, and the sentencing of three men including one police officer, for their roles in the lynching, mob attacks continue to happen in Nigeria. There have been 391 mob killings in Nigeria since 2019, according to SBM Intelligence, a Lagos-based think-tank, with at least five this year alone. That begs the question why the outrage over the killing of the Aluu Four didn't lead to a national reckoning over lynchings."The failure of the criminal justice system is one very important reason for this," said Dr Agwanwo Destiny, a criminologist at the sociology department of the University of Port Harcourt.He pointed to instances where criminal suspects handed over to the police were released without investigation and ended up seeking revenge on those who had given them up."Such incidents erode trust in the judicial system, so when people are alleged to have committed a crime, people are quick to pass judgement and vent their frustrations," Dr Destiny said.It is an argument also made by activist Annkio Briggs, who led demonstrations in Port Harcourt to demand justice for the students and their families, because she "couldn't trust the system to do what was right," she told the BBC.Perpetrators of mob killings in Nigeria are rarely arrested and prosecuted.Two suspects arrested in May after the lynching of a Christian student on allegations of blasphemy in Sokoto have still not been brought to trial, while the police said the main culprits are still at large.It was one of four reported cases of mob killing in that month alone:Two men were burnt to death by a mob in the Ijesha area of Lagos over alleged theft of mobile phonesOne man was murdered in Lugbe, Abuja on allegations of blasphemyCommercial motorcyclists lynched a sound engineer identified as David Imoh in the Lekki area of Lagos.Suspects have been charged in all cases, the police said. But it might be years before there are any verdicts because of the slow pace of justice in Nigeria.Two years ago, Nigeria's anti-corruption agency, the ICPC, said the judiciary was the most corrupt arm of government in the country. It said that more than nine billion naira ($21m; £19m) was offered and paid as bribes in the sector. Such reports indicating that justice is for sale to the highest bidder erode trust in the system, said Dr Destiny.It has never been determined what the four students were doing when they were stopped by the vigilante group in Aluu.One version said they were thieves, another said they were members of a violent gang but neither allegation was proved in court."He was not a perfect child but he was humble and he was our confidant."He was close to us because we had our second child 11 years after him," Mrs Toku said of her son.The four students, best friends, were in their late teens and early 20s and came from middle-class homes.Ugonna, 18, and his friend Lloyd, 19 - known as Tipsy and Big L - were budding musicians in Port Harcourt's rap scene.One of their three unreleased songs Love In The City could almost be a prophesy of what befell them.Growing up in the city like PH where Ra was made to sing rightWe embrace the street life cosThere's no love in the heart of the cityHow can the seeds grow when the garden is wearyIt used to be very cool but the oil crude brought violence"There can be no justification, no reason why anybody should die like that," said their friend Gloria During, who lived in the same Hilton hostel in Aluu as both musicians.Aluu is popular for its private apartments that are rented by students who can't find accommodation at the university's insufficient hostels.At the time it was a small village with many undeveloped plots and a population that were mostly farmers. Today, Port Harcourt's sprawling metropolis has caught up with the fringes of Aluu - most of the land has been built on by Pentecostal churches and more hostels have sprung up.But in the centre of the community remains two barren plots, the playground where the students were first held and death pronounced on them, and the burrow-pit, several hundred yards away, where they were marched to, beaten and killed.Despite the nationwide shock when the incident happened, time has allowed most of Nigeria to move on.But for a mother, time is a keen reminder of the loss of a beloved first son with a bright future ahead of him. "He had a bright career in music, he would have gone far by now," Mrs Toku said. </Text></Article><Article author="BBC News"><Text>Celebrated Indian filmmaker Mani Ratnam's new film Ponniyin Selvan:1, a Tamil-language epic period drama, has taken the box office by storm. Sudha G Tilak on what makes the film a hit.Ponniyin Selvan, based on one of India's greatest emperors, is widely considered by many to be the finest novel ever written in Tamil.It was the name conferred by the loyal subjects on Rajaraja Chola - whose name means 'king of kings' -  of the Chola dynasty, which ruled Tamil land from 9th Century to 13th Century.Rajaraja was not the first of the Chola dynasty but he took their empire to its zenith - from a relatively small kingdom to the dominant empire in India. Their political influence extended across Sri Lanka, Maldives, Sumatra, parts of Thailand and Malaysia, and they had diplomatic ties with China.Rajaraja Chola: Cults of the ImaginationVenice film award for director Mani RatnamHistorian Sunil Khilnani wrote that Rajaraja "pulled off something that no Indian ruler before him seems to have done: he'd commandeered trading boats, timber sailed craft and launched maritime expeditions, bringing far flung wealth back home". The star-studded film, which cost $70m (£62m) to make, revolves around Ponniyin Selvan's ascendency to the throne as his father, the ailing king, retreats from royal duties. The kingdom is embroiled in palace intrigues and an impending coup. Rival members of the royal clan plot to usurp the throne, and enemy kings conspire assassinations. Leading the stratagem is a powerful and enigmatic noblewoman Nandini (played by Bollywood star Aishwarya Rai Bachchan) on a vengeful path to destroy her former lover and the prince-in-waiting (played by award-winning actor Vikram). Her rival is princess Kundavai (played by leading Tamil actress Trisha) who wants to defeat the plots, protect her brothers, and see that her rightful sibling ascends the throne. Row over Bollywood director in Indian Big BrotherActor Karthi plays the part of the colourful Vandiyathevan, a swashbuckling warrior and loyal friend of the princes. He is a musketeer-like figure, charming women, averting disasters, and thwarting plots with clever antics.  Ponniyin Selvan is a fictional literary record of the glory of the Cholas, whose cultural contribution remains visible in modern-day Tamil Nadu. The king's imprint can be seen in the stunning sculptures and inscriptions in a towering granite temple in the city of Thanjavur, which was the seat of the Cholas. The story of Ponniyin Selvan was serialised in Kalki, a Tamil magazine, by writer and journalist Kalki Krishnamurthy in 1955. The sprawling historical fiction, running to nearly 2,000 pages, has been published in several editions and translated into English. Comic books for children based on the novel and theatre productions have kept the epic alive in popular imagination."The novel has a cult following across generations of Tamils. It will be interesting to see how a 21st-Century audience reared on Game of Thrones and homegrown fantasy movies like Baahubali responds to this film based on 10th Century dynastic Tamil politics, royal intrigue, and chicanery," says Chennai-based film scholar Pritam Chakravarthy.Director Mani Ratnam, described as "India's top pop-film auteur", said in an interview that he wanted Ponniyin Selvan to be an "immersive experience" for the audience.Why Bollywood is struggling to beat pandemic bluesThe south Indian films winning on Bollywood's turfScenes of bloody battles and warring soldiers, horseback and elephant chases and dances with actors in regalia captivate audiences. A beachfront invasion, the king battling the savage seas and the sinking of a ship are a nod to the maritime escapades of the Cholas. The dialogue is in medieval Tamil, but written to be accessible to a contemporary audience.  The film's music, a blend of Western chords, folk drum beats, monkey chants and Sufi strains is led by Oscar-winning composer AR Rahman.Critics have appreciated Mani Ratnam for his deft adaptation of a five-part novel into two parts - the second part is due for release next year. Despite the pandemic, the director managed to wrap up filming both the parts of the movie, each running to nearly two-and-a-half hours, in 150 days.Ponniyin Selvan opened to a thunderous reception at the weekend. Cinema halls in the southern city of Chennai saw people queue up for special shows that opened after midnight to accommodate the huge volume of ticket sales. Scenes of fans dancing to folk drumbeats outside cinema halls celebrating the release of the movie were seen across Tamil Nadu.'Struggling' Bollywood's online hate problemThe frenzy over the film has spilled over with fans forming groups to travel across the former kingdoms and villages across Tamil Nadu ruled by the Cholas as mentioned in the novel. The first part ends with a cliff-hanger.

The former officer, aged 34, was sacked in June for drug use, police said.A teacher who survived told Thailand's Thairath TV that the attacker used to drop off his child at the nursery and had seemed polite. A motive remains unclear.At least 22 children were among the dead in the mass killing in the town of Utthai Sawan. Some victims aged as young as two were attacked as they slept. A dozen people who were injured have been taken to Nong Bua Lamphu district hospital.Follow our live coverage"The shooter came in around lunchtime and shot four or five officials at the childcare centre first," a local official, Jidapa Boonsom, who was working nearby, told Reuters news agency. One of them was a teacher who was eight months pregnant."At first people thought it was fireworks," she said, adding that the man then forced entry to a locked room where children were sleeping.'It's shocking' - witnesses describe nursery attack horrorVideos shared on social media appear to show the tears and distress of parents and relatives of those killed, as they gathered at a shelter outside the centre.Police officers arriving after the attack were confronted with horrific scenes, the bodies of adults and children, some of them very young, lying inside and outside the building. Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha described the incident as "a shocking event".Police named the attacker as Panya Kamrab, a local man who had been a police lieutenant colonel before he was dismissed last year for drug use. He is understood to have appeared in court on Thursday on charges related to the use and possible sale of methamphetamine. The verdict was scheduled to be delivered on Friday.Armed with a shotgun, a pistol and a knife, he stormed the nursery at about 12:30 local time (05:30 GMT). The details of what followed are still emerging, but after the killing spree the attacker fled the scene in a white four-door Toyota pick-up truck with Bangkok registration plates, according to police, who launched a search for him and warned locals to keep indoors for their own safety. Eyewitnesses were quoted saying the attacker had driven into bystanders and opened fire at some of them, injuring several people as he made his escape.The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterPolice say Kamrab returned home, killing his wife and son before taking his own life.Mass shootings in Thailand are rare, although gun ownership rates are relatively high for the region. Illegal weapons are also common in the south-east Asian country, according to the Reuters news agency.

Her uncle was also seen on TV speaking against the unrest, as someone seems to whisper to him: "Say it, you scumbag!"The source told BBC Persian that these were both "forced confessions" that came "after intense interrogations and being threatened that other family members would be killed".Atash and Nika's uncle, Mohsen, were detained by authorities after Atash posted messages online about her niece's death and spoke to the media. The televised statements were recorded before they were released, according to the source.The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterAtash told BBC Persian prior to her arrest on Sunday that the Revolutionary Guards had told her that Nika was in their custody for five days and then handed over to prison authorities.The judiciary has said that on the night she disappeared Nika went into a building where eight constructions workers were present, and that she was found dead in the yard outside the next morning.Tehran judiciary official Mohammad Shahriari was cited by state media as saying on Wednesday that a post-mortem showed Nika suffered "multiple fractures... in the pelvis, head, upper and lower limbs, arms and legs, which indicate that the person was thrown from a height".He declared that this proved her death was nothing to do with the protests. However, a death certificate issued by a cemetery in the capital, which was obtained by BBC Persian, states that she died after suffering "multiple injuries caused by blows with a hard object".Nika's Instagram and Telegram accounts were also deleted after she went missing, according to Atash. Iranian security forces are known to demand that detainees give them access to the social media accounts so that the accounts or certain posts can be deleted.Wednesday night's state TV report also featured footage in which Atash was seen confirming that her niece's body was found outside the building mentioned by the judiciary, even though that contradicted previous statements made by her and other members of the family.The family have said they located Nika's body at the mortuary of a detention centre 10 days after she went missing, and that they were only allowed by officials to see her face for a few seconds in order to identify her. Atash said before she was detained that she did not go to the mortuary.Nika's family transferred her body to her father's hometown of Khorramabad, in the west of the country, on Sunday - on what would have been her 17th birthday.A source close to them told BBC Persian that the family agreed, under duress from authorities, not to hold a public funeral. But, the source said, security forces then "stole" Nika's body from Khorramabad and secretly buried it in the village of Veysian, about 40km (25 miles) away.Hundreds of protesters later gathered in Khorramabad's cemetery and chanted slogans against the government, including "death to the dictator" - a reference to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei.Nika is not the only young female protester to have been killed during the unrest that erupted last month following the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman who was detained by the morality police for allegedly violating the Islamic Republic's strict hijab law.The family of Hadis Najafi, 22, have said that she was shot dead by security forces while protesting in the city of Karaj, west of Tehran, on 21 September. Officials allegedly asked her father to say that she died of a heart attack.Another 16-year-old girl, Sarina Esmailzadeh, died after being severely beaten on the head with batons by security forces during protests in Karaj on 23 September, Amnesty International cited a source as saying. The source also told the human rights group that security and intelligence agents had harassed the girl's family to coerce them into silence.  Several videos made by Sarina before her death have now been posted on social media. In one recorded after finishing some school exams, she says: "Nothing feels better than freedom."  </Text></Article><Article author="By Paul Kirby"><Text>At least 17 people have died and another 15 people are missing after a migrant boat sank off the Greek island of Lesbos on Wednesday night.The Greek coastguard said the dinghy had left the Turkish coast carrying 40 people in very high winds.Elsewhere in Greece dozens of migrants were rescued when their boat hit rocks near the southern island of Kythira.Coastguard video showed a group of people trapped beneath a cliff as rescuers pulled them to safety.Both boats went down within hours of each other on Wednesday night and early on Thursday, hundreds of kilometres apart.Volunteers joined rescue officials at the top of the cliff face on Kythira, an island off the Peloponnese region of southern Greece. The migrant boat broke up close to the island's eastern harbour at Diakofti in winds of up to 70km/h (45mph) and according to Greek reports one of those on board raised the alarm when it got into trouble."We could see the boat smashing against the rocks and people climbing up those rocks to try and save themselves," local resident Martha Stathaki told the Associated Press news agency. Eighty of the 95 people on board are said to have been rescued on the Kythira coast. Greek reports say they had originally come from Iran, Afghanistan and Iraq and included 55 men and 18 children.Mayor Stratos Harhalakis said the boat had arrived at the worst possible point on Kythira as a gale-force winds pushed  it on to treacherous rocks. He described seeing five people drown as they were swept away. Their small boat was big enough for 15 to 20 people, rather than almost 100, he said. Meanwhile, on Lesbos, authorities said the bodies of 16 young women of African origin and a young boy had been recovered after their boat went down near Thermi. Ten women were rescued and taken to the local hospital at Mytilini. Lesbos was also hit by powerful winds as the coastguard searched for survivors.Local officials said the boat had left the Turkish port of Ayvali and Greek Migration Minister Notis Mitarachi called on Turkey to take "immediate action" to put an end to irregular migrant crossings in harsh weather. "Already today many lives lost in the Aegean, people are drowning in unseaworthy vessels. EU must act," he tweeted.While Lesbos is a short distance from the coast of western Turkey, Kythira lies some 400km (250km) west of Turkey's coastline on the Aegean Sea and is on what has become known as the smugglers' "Calabrian" route, named after their destination in southern Italy.Last month two migrant boats landed on Kythira carrying almost 100 people, mainly from Afghanistan. More and more crossings are being made from Turkey to the Italian coast, bypassing Greece.</Text></Article><Article author="By Helen Bushby and Ian Youngs"><Text>French writer Annie Ernaux has won the Nobel Prize in Literature, for what the panel said was an "uncompromising" 50-year body of work exploring "a life marked by great disparities regarding gender, language and class".The prestigious accolade is awarded by the Swedish Academy and is worth 10 million Swedish kronor (£807,000).She said it was "a great honour".Professor Carl-Henrik Heldin, chair of the committee, said the 82-year-old's work was "admirable and enduring".He said she used "courage and clinical acuity" to tell semi-autobiographical stories that uncover "the contradictions of social experience [and] describe shame, humiliation, jealousy or the inability to see who you are".The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterHer books, including A Man's Place and A Woman's Story, are considered to be contemporary classics in France.Ernaux is the first French woman to win the literature prize, and told Swedish broadcaster SVT it was "a responsibility"."I was very surprised... I never thought it would be on my landscape as a writer," she said. "It is a great responsibility... to testify, not necessarily in terms of my writing, but to testify with accuracy and justice in relation to the world."Jacques Testard, from Fitzcarraldo Editions which publishes English translations of her work, told BBC World Service Radio's Newshour she is an "exceptional and unique" writer. "She's a very important feminist writer, I would say, also a very important working class writer - both of those themes I think very clearly visible in her work," he explained. Dr Ruth Cruickshank, who specialises in contemporary French fiction at Royal Holloway, University of London, said: "When a woman wins the Nobel Prize for Literature it is always great news. Thirteen dead and two living white French men have been Nobel laureates since 1901."She explores memories of life experiences - both extraordinary and relatable - a backstreet abortion; failed affairs whether with a lover in Russia or a man 30 years younger; the death of her parents; breast cancer."Ernaux was born in 1940 in Normandy, where the setting for her early life was "poor but ambitious", Prof Heldin said.Her parents ran a café and grocery shop, and when she encountered girls from middle-class backgrounds, she experienced the "shame of her working-class parents and milieu for the first time," according to her website.That would later feed into her novels. Her official biography said the main themes of her work were "the body and sexuality; intimate relationships; social inequality and the experience of changing class through education; time and memory; and the overarching question of how to write these life experiences".Ernaux studied literature, having worked as an au pair in London, and was married with two children and teaching in a French secondary school when her first book was published in 1974.Cleaned Out was a fictionalised account of the illegal abortion she had in 1964, which she kept secret from her family.She revisited that trauma 25 years later for the book Happening, in which she "sifts through her memories and her journal entries dating from those days". It was turned into a film that won the top prize at last year's Venice Film Festival.Prof Heldin added: "Annie Ernaux manifestly believes in the liberating force of writing. Her work is uncompromising and written in plain language, scraped clean."The writer got divorced in the early 1980s, and in 2000 she retired from teaching to devote herself to writing.Another of Ernaux's books, The Years, won the Prix Renaudot in France in 2008 and the Premio Strega in Italy in 2016, while a year later she won the Marguerite Yourcenar Prize for her life's work.In 2019, The Years went on to be shortlisted for the Man Booker International Prize, whose judges called it a "genre-bending masterpiece".Booker said at the time that "autobiography is given a new form, at once subjective and impersonal, private and collective".The New Yorker wrote in 2020 that over her 20 books, "she has been devoted to a single task: the excavation of her own life".The Nobel Prizes, awarded since 1901, recognise achievement in literature, science, peace and latterly economics. Last year's literary prize was won by Tanzanian novelist Abdulrazak Gurnah.Other winners have included novelists such as Ernest Hemingway, Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Toni Morrison, plus poets such as Louise Gluck, Pablo Neruda, Joseph Brodsky and Rabindranath Tagore, and playwrights including Harold Pinter and Eugene O'Neill.</Text></Article><Article author="By Jessica Parker"><Text>The leaders of more than 40 European countries are having talks in Prague, at a historic first meeting of a new political forum of nations.As he arrived, France's Emmanuel Macron spoke of building a "common strategy" in response to Russia's war in Ukraine.UK Prime Minister Liz Truss joined leaders from the EU, Turkey, Norway and the Balkans, as Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky spoke via video link.Germany's chancellor said the gathering was a great innovation.The summit, billed as a European Political Community beyond the EU, has been championed by Emmanuel Macron, who told reporters on Thursday it sent a "message of unity". But there is scepticism, even within the EU, about the new forum. Ahead of the meeting, Ms Truss made clear it was "not an EU construct or an EU alternative". Nevertheless, her decision to take part could mark a new phase in the UK's post-Brexit relations with Europe. The leaders were discussing energy, migration and security, with a particular focus on the war in Ukraine. Officials said Ms Truss spoke of the need for stronger, more resilient economies and energy supplies, while stressing the need for freedom to succeed.Ukraine's president told the summit: "You and I are now in a strong position to direct all the possible might of Europe to end the war and guarantee long-term peace for Ukraine, for Europe, for the world."EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said in a blog that in the wake of Russia's invasion, there was a need to "rethink and reform the wider European order, beyond the work of the EU and Nato", but he added that the summit would be no more than an initial exchange.As well as the UK, non-EU members Switzerland, Turkey, Norway, Iceland, Georgia, Azerbaijan and western Balkan countries are among those taking part in the first gathering of the EPC.Germany's Olaf Scholz pointed out that all the countries attending the summit knew that Russia's war was "a brutal violation of the security and peace order that we have had in Europe over recent decades".Critics see it as a vague regurgitation of old ideas and its exact role has yet to be made clear. When he proposed the idea this year, President Macron said it would "offer a platform for political co-ordination" for countries, both those in the EU and those not. Russia's invasion of Ukraine gave new impetus for co-operation among nations beyond the EU's 27 member states. What is the new European Political Community?Truss pledges billions to support Ukraine in 2023But the new EPC has no institutions or dedicated staff. That has led to questions about how any decisions would be implemented. So it's an unprecedented effort to bring leaders together from across the continent to discuss areas of shared interest. If it proves to be a success, it may continue to take place up to twice a year. If it's a failure, it could fizzle out.Ms Truss had been hostile to the EPC project, so what changed?Some observers point out it was never likely she would voice passionate enthusiasm for a French-led European meet-up while vying for the Tory leadership.But once in power, she appeared to warm to the idea, although Downing Street is reluctant to accept suggestions that Mr Macron won her over.It might prove to be a "modest" turning point in EU-UK relations, says the director of the Centre for European Reform, Charles Grant.While a row about post-Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland remains unresolved, talks are restarting this week."Neither side is trying to push that issue to the brink at the moment," says Mr Grant. "So this summit could be a sign of a modest rapprochement."The official line was that the PM was taking part because she wanted to "shore up" support for Ukraine and "galvanise" collective action on energy security and migration.Downing Street said Ms Truss would call on leaders to keep oil and gas interconnectors open this winter while taking part in talks on joint projects to develop new nuclear and offshore wind capacity.Another draw for the UK was the presence of Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan, as well as the participation of Norway, a key supplier of energy to the UK.The UK has been less keen to talk about security, with jitters that the EPC could be seen as somehow cutting across the Nato military alliance.If the EPC does prove short on solid outcomes, then expect it to be long on messages about support for Ukraine and condemnation of the Kremlin.But not all those attending are of one mind on the conflict."One of the measures of success will be, does it persuade Serbia, Azerbaijan and Turkey to lean a bit more to the West and less towards Russia?" says Mr Grant.Turkey has talked of a "balanced" approach to Russia and has not signed up to Western sanctions."When first proposed by Macron, the EPC was supposed to be a club with shared democratic values, but it's now more about making sure Europe as a whole isn't Russia's friend," says Mr Grant.A sign of the uncertainty about what the EPC is really for is that there have been far clearer messages about what it is not.It's not a substitute for Nato or the G7, we're told. It's not a slightly comfier "waiting room" for countries eager to join the EU. Nor it is a forum that will be dominated by EU institutions.That's despite invites having been issued by the president of the European Council, Charles Michel, while the meeting itself has been tacked on to the front of an EU summit.Brussels insists it has merely been facilitating the forum - it's not "the EU plus plus", insisted one senior official.The next EPC, in either six months or a year's time, is likely to be held in Moldova.If the project survives, the UK is currently fourth in line to host a summit. But British officials are keen to play it cool on the EPC, insisting they will walk away if it evolves in an undesirable direction.</Text></Article><Article author="BBC News"><Text>Oscar-winning actor Kevin Spacey has gone on trial in New York over an allegation he sexually assaulted a boy 36 years ago.Mr Spacey is facing a civil lawsuit brought by Anthony Rapp, who says the actor inappropriately touched him at a party in 1986 when he was aged 14.Mr Spacey, 63, is separately facing five charges of sexual assault in the UK.The House of Cards actor has denied the allegations against him. Both Mr Rapp, now 51 and also an actor, and Mr Spacey were in the Manhattan federal courthouse when the trial opened with jury selection on Thursday.Mr Rapp says that Mr Spacey was around 26 or 27 years old when he met him at a party at his Manhattan apartment. In a Buzzfeed article from October 2017, Mr Rapp said that Mr Spacey had picked him up, placed him on a bed and lay down partially on top of him."I was aware that he was trying to get with me sexually," Mr Rapp said.His lawsuit says the alleged encounter lasted no more than two minutes and "there was no kissing, no undressing, no reaching under clothes, and no sexualized statements or innuendo".The legal action was filed in September 2020 and accuses Mr Spacey - whose real name is Kevin Spacey Fowler - of battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress.Mr Rapp is reportedly seeking $40m (£35m) in damages.The judge assigned to the case, Lewis A Kaplan, previously dismissed a charge of sexual assault, ruling the statute of limitations had expired. One day after the Buzzfeed article was posted five years ago, Mr Spacey took to social media to say he had no memory of what Mr Rapp described. "If I did behave then as he describes, I owe him the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior," he wrote."And I am sorry for the feelings he describes having carried with him all these years."In a video deposition he filmed with lawyers in January, Mr Spacey denied that the incident ever took place, according to news website Law &amp; Crime.  Mr Rapp's account "couldn't have been true", he said, because "I am not interested in boys and I do not touch people inappropriately".Mr Rapp stars in Star Trek: Discovery on Paramount+ and was previously in the Broadway musical Rent. Separate sex assault charges - alleging that Mr Spacey groped an 18-year-old at a restaurant in Nantucket, Massachusetts, in 2016 - collapsed in 2019 after the actor's lawyers argued the accuser had manipulated text messages on his phone.In August, a judge ruled that Spacey must pay $31m to the producers of House of Cards for the costs they incurred after firing him from the show. In July, he entered a not guilty plea in London to criminal charges of sexually assaulting three men over a decade ago. That trial is due to begin in June 2023.</Text></Article><Article author="BBC News"><Text>A global alert has been issued over four cough syrups after the World Health Organization (WHO) warned they could be linked to the deaths of 66 children in The Gambia. The syrups have been "potentially linked with acute kidney injuries and 66 deaths among children", it said. The products were manufactured by an Indian company, Maiden Pharmaceuticals, which had failed to provide guarantees about their safety, the WHO added.The firm has not yet commented.The BBC has contacted Maiden Pharmaceuticals for comment.Indian officials say they have asked the WHO to share evidence of the link between the syrups and the deaths.The WHO identified the medicines as Promethazine Oral Solution, Kofexmalin Baby Cough Syrup, Makoff Baby Cough Syrup and Magrip N Cold Syrup. The four products had been identified in The Gambia, but "may have been distributed, through informal markets, to other countries or regions", the WHO added, in the alert published on its website.It warned that their use may result in serious injury or death, especially among children.The WHO's intervention came after medical authorities in The Gambia - a popular tourist destination - detected an increase in cases of acute kidney injury among children under the age of five in late July.The Gambia's government has since suspended the use of all paracetamol syrups and has urged people to use tablets instead.The number of deaths has declined since the ban but two more have been recorded in the past two weeks, Gambia health services director Mustapha Bittay told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme.He said that The Gambia did not currently have a laboratory capable of testing whether medicines were safe and so they had to be sent abroad for checking. Mr Bittay added that The Gambia was in discussions with the World Bank to get funding for a quality-control laboratory.The WHO said that laboratory analysis of samples of the products "confirms that they contain unacceptable amounts of diethylene glycol and ethylene glycol as contaminants".The substances were toxic, and their effects "can include abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhoea, inability to pass urine, headache, altered mental state and acute kidney injury which may lead to death," it added. Mr Bittay also said that traces had also been found of E.Coli, a bacteria which can cause diarrhoea and vomiting.The Gambia's health officials said last month that dozens of children had died, without giving an exact number.Speaking in Geneva on Wednesday, WHO chief Tedros Ghebreyesus said: "The loss of these young lives is beyond heart-breaking for their families." The WHO said that India's Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation indicated that the manufacturer may have only supplied the contaminated medications to The Gambia, AFP news agency reports, quoting an email from the UN health agency.But the WHO said that "global exposure" was possible as the "manufacturer may have used the same contaminated material in other products and distributed them locally or exported" them, the agency reports. </Text></Article><Article author="By Alex Therrien"><Text>A top chess player accused of cheating has insisted he is "not going to back down" after making his first comments on the scandal in nearly a month.On Tuesday, a Chess.com investigation claimed it was "likely" Hans Niemann cheated in more than 100 games online.The 19-year-old American rising star had already been accused of cheating by world champion Magnus Carlsen.Speaking on Wednesday after winning his US Championship game, Niemann said his victory was "a message to everyone". In a news conference following a convincing win against 15-year-old grandmaster Christopher Yoo, Niemann was asked about the "elephant in the room" - a reference to the cheating scandal that has gripped the chess world.Without addressing the allegations directly, Niemann said: "This game is a message to everyone. This entire thing started with me saying 'chess speaks for itself' and I think this game spoke for itself and showed the chess player I am. "It also showed I'm not going to back down and I'm going to play my best chess here regardless of the pressure."Niemann then cut the interview short after less than 60 seconds.The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on Twitter"You can leave it to your own interpretation, but thank you, that's it", he said when the interviewer tried to ask more questions."That's all I can say, because it was such a beautiful game I don't even need to describe it," he concluded.  Niemann, who was playing in the first round of the US Championship in St Louis, then walked out of the interview, prompting commentator Yasser Seirawan to laugh and say: "What? That's it? Ok." Until the interview Niemann had not spoken about the scandal since 7 September when he admitted to cheating in informal games when he was younger but strenuously denied doing so in competitive games.Niemann added that he was willing to play naked to prove his innocence and accused Carlsen and Chess.com of trying to ruin his career. The cheating row that's blowing up the chess worldWorld's top chess player accuses opponent of cheatingChess player 'likely cheated' in 100 games - reportThe scandal began last month after 31-year-old Carlsen, considered by many to be the greatest player of all time, was defeated by Niemann at the Sinquefield Cup in a major upset. The Norwegian made veiled accusations of cheating against Niemann at the time before openly accusing him last week. Then on Tuesday, a Chess.com investigation claimed it was likely Niemann had cheated "much more often" than he had admitted to, including in prize money events and against highly-rated "well known" figures in the game. Chess.com also noted "anomalies" in Niemann's rate of improvement, which has seen him soar up the rankings in classical chess from around 800 in the world to the top 50 in less than two years.The site said this rise was the fastest in "modern recorded history" and had occurred "much later in life than his peers".But it found no evidence he had cheated in his game against Carlsen or in any other over-the-board games.A separate statistical analysis of Niemann's over-the-board games by Prof Kenneth Regan, widely regarded as the world's leading expert on cheating in chess, has also found no evidence he cheated.Not since 2006's "Toiletgate" has chess faced a cheating scandal at the elite levels of the game. Back then, world championship challenger Veselin Topalov's team accused the champion Vladimir Kramnik of cheating during his "strange, if not suspicious" trips to the bathroom. Prof Regan also found no evidence Kramnik had cheated.</Text></Article><Article author="By Nathan Williams"><Text>Gunmen have shot dead the mayor of a small town in western Mexico, and at least 17 others, officials say.Police say gunmen stormed the San Miguel Totolapan town hall at 14:00 (19:00 GMT) on Wednesday. Photos online show it riddled with bullet holes.Mayor Conrado Mendoza Almeda's left-wing PRD party condemned his "cowardly" assassination and demanded justice.The attack has been blamed on the Los Tequileros criminal gang, which is linked to a powerful drug cartel.Police officers and council workers were also killed in the massacre, with graphic images of bloodied bodies lying on the ground circulating on social media. Mr Mendoza Almeda's father, former mayor Juan Mendoza Acosta, was also killed - in his home - before the attack moved to the town hall.A highway in the state of Guerrero, where San Miguel Totolapan lies, was reportedly briefly blocked by large vehicles to prevent security forces from getting into the city.Even by the violent standards of Guerrero state, this was a shocking attack, reports the BBC's Mexico correspondent, Will Grant.San Miguel Totolapan lies in the heart of a region known as Tierra Caliente, a violent part of drug cartel-controlled western Mexico. Various groups battle for control of the lucrative drug routes north along the Pacific corridor, our correspondent adds. The region is a hotspot for the growing of opium poppies and the production of heroin.In a preliminary report seen by local media, Guerrero's attorney general said that as well as the 18 people who were killed, three others were wounded.It is not yet clear what the motive behind the attack may have been but killings of local officials are not uncommon.In 2018, at least three dozen mayors, former mayors and mayoral candidates were killed. The number has dwindled to single figures in recent years but those who hold local office remain at risk from armed gangs, which often want to be the only authority in town.Following the attack, the defence ministry said it was deploying army and navy units to the area to find the gunmen.  Guerrero Governor Evelyn Salgado Pineda tweeted to say she deeply regretted the deaths.Shortly before the attack, alleged members of Los Tequileros released a video on social networks announcing its return to the region, where they had been fighting a rival drug gang.The criminal group devastated Guerrero between 2015 and 2017 - and was known for threatening mayors of the region - until its leader Raybel Jacobo de Almonte was assassinated.De Almonte was known as El Tequilero - the Tequila Drinker - and his gang took their name from him.Additional reporting by Tiffany Wertheimer</Text></Article><Article author="By Tessa Wong"><Text>I'm stuck at home taking care of a sick child, when a familiar feeling suddenly hits - a craving for durian.But there's no need to head out to a durian stall or supermarket to buy the tropical fruit, lug it home, and wrestle open its spiky husk.I just whip out my phone, open an app called Grab, and make a few taps.Forty-five minutes later, there's a knock on my door. A deliveryman hands over a bag: it's my durian, freshly shucked and sealed in plastic tubs, ready to eat.From ordering cabs and food, to paying our bills and booking holidays, super-apps like Grab offer a mindboggling array of services. They don't exist yet in the West - Elon Musk is thinking of creating one called X - but in many parts of Asia they've already been a vital part of our everyday lives for the past few years. I mostly use Grab to get a ride home after a night out, or order Thai takeaway when I haven't got the energy to cook dinner for the family.But many in Singapore also use it to send parcels and documents, or shop online - one colleague just purchased a home karaoke set.     Other extensions allow you to book bus and ferry tickets, make hotel reservations, and even arrange for someone to come to your home and do a professional Covid swab test.These can be paid for through the app's finance system. There's an e-wallet linked to your bank account or credit card, or you can set up instalment plans, or pay with points which you earn with every activity done through the app. It can also be used for cashless payments - you pay for items at a shop by scanning a QR code with the app, or you can get a physical card linked to your account.But Grab is not the only player in town.There are super-apps aplenty from Indonesia's GoJek to India's PayTM and they allow you to do even more, such as book a manicure, order fuel for your motorbike, pay your traffic fine and purchase gold. They have caught on in a region of digital natives - in South East Asia alone, about three-quarters of our population use the internet, and of that group, 88% own a smartphone.Elon Musk, Twitter and the mysterious X app Then, there's China's WeChat - the original Asian super-app said to be the inspiration for Mr Musk's X.It's a messaging and social media platform that's evolved into one of the region's biggest apps in terms of its range of services and number of users. At last count it's estimated to have 1.29 billion users in China alone. WeChat is also one of China's biggest payment networks, with consumers using it to pay for goods and services and to send money to each other. Some research suggests that a Chinese user spends as much as a third of their waking life on WeChat alone.Much has been written about how its ubiquity in Chinese everyday life, operating in a society tightly controlled by the government has seen WeChat become a tool of surveillance and censorship.Messages, posts and even accounts are routinely blocked for content deemed politically sensitive, and there are concerns of how it could contribute to the various controversial "social credit" schemes in China, where citizens' lives can be restricted based on their bank credit scores or social behaviour. In 2020, WeChat introduced its own scoring system where users get extra privileges if they have good in-app credit records.The example of WeChat highlights the main concern about super-apps - with everyone doing practically everything on just a few platforms, these apps end up collecting a vast trove of data on people, and could wield some power over our daily lives.WeChat and the Surveillance StateHow such data is treated and to what extent governments should have access to it will be part of the debate in societies where privacy is particularly prized. Mr Musk's X super-app - if it does come to fruition - may be seen by some with suspicion as a double-edged Swiss Army knife.For others though, the convenience and simplicity of living life on one app is an easy trade-off to make. There's always the option of scaling back their use, for those with deep concerns about privacy.And in open markets, specialty apps will continue to vie for users' attention, reducing the likelihood of most of the data ending up in the hands of just one or two companies - one reason for WeChat's dominance in China is because some apps like Twitter and WhatsApp are blocked there.Here in Singapore, I don't do everything on Grab. It's not because I distrust it, but I prefer using specialty apps to do other things like grocery shopping and buying clothes as they're just better at it.So I'm fine with Grab humming away in the recesses of my phone because it doesn't know everything about me, just some things - like the fact that I love delivery durian.</Text></Article><Article author="By Ashley Lime &amp; Carolyne Kiambo"><Text>A school dormitory in western Kenya burned down a few weeks ago and several students were arrested on suspicion of arson - just the latest instance of a devastating criminal pattern that has dominated the country's education system for more than 30 years. Last year saw a particular spike in the number of boarding school arson attacks by the pupils, which students blamed on an intensified curriculum following time lost to the Covid lockdown. The second half of the year saw an average of three a week. The BBC has spoken to students whose schools have been set on fire to investigate what lies behind the regular attacks.The names of the students have been changedIt was about 16:30 on a Sunday afternoon when someone on the school field spotted the fire. At first, Lillian wasn't too worried. It was just the matron burning rubbish, someone said. But before long, screaming students began streaming out of the school building. Smoke was pouring out of Lillian's dorm. Lillian [not her real name], 15 at the time of the attack last October, was terrified. She knew her good friend was in the building having a nap."People were crying, they were traumatised… [I could see] smoke had covered the entire dorm."They watched as students at Buruburu Girls High School - in the capital Nairobi - began jumping from the windows to escape. Lillian doesn't know for sure what provoked the arson attack. But she claims that students were deeply unhappy about the amount of academic pressure they were under in the run up to national exams."We're usually in class by 4.30am every morning," Lillian told the BBC last November. Independent study then continued to 22:00, she said. Boarding schools are the main educators of secondary school-aged children in Kenya - seen as a way of getting good quality subsidised education, and places where children can concentrate on their studies.Another student, Mary, 16, confirmed that there had been no extra curricular activities last year, and said the academic schedule had been intense."We had to add more lessons to cover the syllabus in time… it was quite challenging." The terrors of Kenya’s school fire epidemic Her mother confirmed that her daughter had complained of long hours and poor student-teacher relations. The BBC asked Buruburu Girls High School to comment but it did not respond. Kenya's boarding schools are educationally demanding, admits Dr Newton Mwangi, a former principal of Passenga Secondary School who retired last year."Nowadays a child who does not make a good score to take him or her to university is like a condemned child," he says.Arson attacks are not a new issue in Kenyan boarding schools - the deadliest Kenyan school arson took place 20 years ago, killing 67 students in Machakos County, south-east of Nairobi.The fires are particularly dangerous because they are usually lit in dormitories, as was the case in Lillian's school. Although her friend finally emerged through the fire exit unscathed, 59 of the girls were reported by local media to have received hospital treatment for smoke inhalation, minor burns, and fractures.  Such attacks have historically been debated only behind closed doors - the government refuses to share data with the media on the number of school arson attacks, or discuss the issue. But in November 2021, the Ministry of Education issued a response to a parliamentary committee which had requested more information on the school arson crisis and revealed that there were 126 arson cases between January and November last year. It revealed that 302 students had been arrested in connection with those incidents and of those, 41 had appeared in court accused of arson and destruction of property.We don't know how many of those 41 were found guilty, because Kenyan courts restrict reporting on crimes involving children, children's lawyer Paul Muchiri told the BBC. One of the few convictions we are aware of took place earlier this year. An 18-year-old was found guilty of manslaughter for starting a fire that resulted in the death of 10 students at Moi Girls High School in Nairobi in 2017 when she was 14. The student, only identified as TWG, was handed a five-year prison term. The Ministry of Education statement issued in November listed what it believed to be the reasons behind the arson epidemic, which included: overcrowding, poor teacher-student relations, drug abuse, and inadequate counselling services within schools. It suggested however that the fault did not just lie with academic institutions, remarking that parents were "overprotective" of their children when accused of misbehaviour, and that the law hindered teachers' ability to discipline pupils. Its recommendations included recruiting professional school counsellors - but it also suggested "critically" examining the role of boarding schools in Kenya's education system. Lillian not only missed nine days of school as a result of the destruction, but all students' families were asked to pay collective damages, a common policy according to local media reports. Lillian's mother shared a letter from the school with the BBC dated 5 November - five days after the fire - requesting 1,500 Kenyan shillings [£10] "for damages incurred". The family lives in a slum and she says this was a huge amount of money for the family to find.The Ministry of Education did not respond to the BBC's request for an interview. School arson is not unique to Kenya, says Elizabeth Cooper, a Canadian academic and anthropologist who has spent years in Kenya studying the issue.But she says what is remarkable is its frequency, severity and collective nature. "Many students participate, sometimes planning in advance, sometimes being coerced to participate by other students… [which] points to… this idea that there could be some consensus around the logic of using arson," she told the BBC.Dr Cooper believes this might be because students feel as though setting fire to their schools is working to an extent, and that it might be time to consider a different approach to education in Kenya, which currently relies on "trying to strong-arm [students] into compliance". The potential to shift thinking on this might lie with teacher training colleges, she says, but parents, governors and politicians would all need to be brought on board, meaning it will take time "to try shifting the culture of how education is done".</Text></Article><Article author="By Jonathan Beale"><Text>The war in Ukraine has underlined the growing importance of space to armies on the ground. In an interview with the BBC, the head of the US Space Force, General Jay Raymond, describes it as the "first war where commercial space capabilities have really played a significant role". It's also the first  major conflict in which both sides have become so reliant on space.Gen Raymond - whose service is the newest branch of the US armed forces - avoids giving precise details of how the US and its allies have been helping Ukraine. But he gives a clear indication of what it's been doing. "We use space to help strike with precision, we use space to provide warnings of missiles, of any threat that could come to the United States or to our allies or partners," he says. There are already more than 5,000 satellites in space - most are operated for commercial purposes. But among them are hundreds of dedicated military satellites - the US, Russia and China having the largest number. Ukraine has none. But it has received significant help from the West in a number of ways. The first is providing intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance - or ISR. Ukraine has had access to unprecedented amounts of commercial satellite imagery. At a recent conference, the director of the US National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency said it had more than doubled the commercial imagery available over Ukraine in the run-up to the war.  Air Vice-Marshal Paul Godfrey, who heads the UK's Space Command, says that along with commercial and civilian ISR provided to Ukraine "there's an awful lot of nations with military capabilities in space - they're looking at Ukraine as well".Space ISR helped identify the initial build-up of Russian forces before the invasion on 24 February and the movement of troops and military hardware ever since. Satellites have been used to track Russian warships in the Black Sea, including the cruiser Moskva which was sunk by Ukraine.  Early warning radar - like the giant one at RAF Fylingdales in North Yorkshire - have also been able to track the launch of ballistic missiles.Air Vice-Marshal Godfrey says ISR satellites have also been essential for "telling the truth" about the war. He gives the example of the massacre in Bucha, near Ukraine's capital Kyiv. He says Russian claims that the bodies of dead civilians were already on the streets when they arrived were contradicted by time-stamped satellite imagery showing otherwise. Media organisations, including the BBC, have also had unprecedented access to commercial satellite imagery - which can be used to corroborate claims on the ground. That includes identifying mass graves or Ukraine's recent attack on a Russian airbase in Crimea, a southern Ukrainian peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014. Early warning radar have also been able to track the launch of ballistic missiles. The US is also now in detailed  discussions about installing more giant radar in the UK to keep an eye on what's happening in space.And recently Ukrainian volunteers have fundraised enough money to buy an entire satellite to help the country's military in detecting Russian targets.The Sar (Synthetic Aperture Radar) satellite of the Finnish company ICEYE has proved to be extremely effective - in just the first two days of its usage the Russian military damages exceeded $16m - more that the cost of the satellite purchase, Ukrainian officials say.Space has also been crucial to communications throughout the war. At the start of the war Russia conducted a series of military strikes and cyber-attacks to take out Ukraine's key communication nodes. Air Vice-Marshal Godfrey credits Elon Musk with "essentially getting the internet back up and running in Ukraine" - helped by an appeal on Twitter by the Ukrainian Minister of Digital Transformation, Mykhailo Fedorov.The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterElon Musk has sent thousands of Starlink internet kits to Ukraine giving access to SpaceX's constellation of satellites in orbit. They've been essential to providing Ukraine's military with secure communications and situational awareness throughout the war. I've seen them being used from Ukrainian command bunkers in the country's eastern Donbas region.  Both Russia, and more recently Ukraine, have been relying on space-based positioning, navigation and timing (PNT) to conduct precision strikes on key targets, with Russia's cruise missiles using its own Glonass positioning satellites to find their targets. For Ukraine, the addition of US-supplied precision weapons to its arsenal have been key to its recent advances. Himars rockets - which have a range of up to 50 miles (80km) and are guided by GPS - have been used to destroy key targets, such as ammunition dumps and command centres well behind the frontline. More recently, the US has supplied Ukraine with GPS  guided Excalibur artillery shells - more accurate than so-called dumb ammunition. Precision has made a difference. The increasing reliance on space raises concerns that conflict could spread beyond land, sea and air. Russia and China have both conducted tests to destroy their own satellites, and Admiral Tony Radakin, the UK's Chief of the Defence Staff, has recently warned that Russia could carry out attacks on Western targets in space.  Gen Raymond says "there's a full spectrum of threats we're concerned about". He lists GPS and communications jamming, direct energy weapons like lasers, or missiles fired from the ground which could be used to target satellites. He says the US and its allies want to make sure that there's always safe and responsible behaviour in space - but adds "what worries me is not everybody shares that view". In reality, the militarisation of space is well under way.

But it's a move with other Scandinavian precedents.In 2019, Sweden's monarch, King Carl XVI Gustaf, removed royal status from five of his grandchildren.It was again with a nod towards the public mood of not wanting too many royals getting taxpayers' funding.Danish Queen 'sorry' over stripping of royal titlesSwedish King removes grandchildren's royal statusHow is the Royal Family in Britain funded?It might also be seen as an inevitable consequence of the hereditary and dynastic principle of monarchy. Family trees are often going to get bigger, with widening branches of children, grandchildren and relations.So, like clipping back a royal garden, every so often there will have to be a careful pruning of those defined as having royal status.This reduced-scale approach in Denmark might be in tune with public opinion, with more than three-quarters supporting the monarchy.This is also a country where the level of public funding for the royal family - currently about £11m per year for the queen, her residences and staff - is linked to the pay index of Denmark's state-sector employees.But could this be an example for the British Royal Family, with King Charles III long associated with calls for a "slimmed-down" monarchy?This has never been very specifically defined, but has been interpreted as a plan to focus more tightly on a smaller group of royals - sending a message of purposeful frugality.It's like the wedding photograph with just the main participants rather than the group shot of whoever was there at the time.This slimming down might have already happened by default, with Prince Andrew, Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex no longer carrying out royal duties or receiving public funding. Buckingham Palace now uses the concept of "working royals" for a smaller group who carry out the round of visits, ceremonies and constitutional duties, distinguishing them from a wider range of royal relatives.The working royals include the King, Queen Consort, Prince William and Catherine, the Princess of Wales; Princess Anne; Prince Edward and Sophie, Countess of Wessex; Princess Alexandra and the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester.Last year there were 2,300 official engagements carried out. Princess Anne on her own carried out almost 400.At the Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations earlier this year, the distinction between working and non-working royals was visibly played out on the symbolic platform of the Buckingham Palace balcony.Prince Harry and Meghan, and Prince Andrew were not on the balcony to wave to the crowds. There were 18 royals on view - presenting much less of a crowd scene, when on occasions in the past there have been more than 40 people on the balcony.The reign of the new King has only just begun, but there are likely to be questions about how he might want to re-shape the monarchy and how the royal households will be run.Close to the issue of the size of the monarchy will be its cost to the public.The public funding of the Royal Family in Britain comes via the Sovereign Grant, which is based on a proportion of the profits from the independently-run Crown Estates.This pays for the running costs of the monarchy and its working royals - such as staff, travel, overseas visits, the upkeep of buildings, with £86m received last year, with extra costs from renovating Buckingham Palace pushing up overall spending to £102m.The Prince of Wales also has an income from the Duchy of Cornwall and the monarch has a private income from the Duchy of Lancaster.Although slimming down the number of cash-hungry royal buildings, rather than the number of people, could be the biggest financial question. Repairs and refurbishments to Buckingham Palace alone cost £54m last year, more than half the total of expenditure.However, the new King can look to the future with a sense of rising popularity, according to YouGov polling last month, which showed 70% now having a positive view of him, up from 54% earlier in the year and before he took to the throne.But there are big underlying generational differences in attitudes towards the monarchy, according to YouGov. While about two-thirds across all ages back the monarchy, it's below half for 18-24 year olds.Monarchies have always had to adapt to survive. As Queen Margrethe said about her own slimming-down plans, she had to "ensure that the monarchy always shapes itself in keeping with the times".</Text></Article><Article author="By Nadine Yousif"><Text>For humans, staying warm in the winter often means swapping out flimsy tank-tops for thick parkas. For Alaskan bears, it means eating a jaw-dropping 500lb (225 kg) of fresh salmon. These bulking creatures are the focal point of Fat Bear Week - a highly anticipated online bracket that pits the portly mammals at Alaska's Katmai National Park against one another, with voters crowning the fattest of them all.  The competition is stiff this year: Otis, a large adult bear with the record for most Fat Bear Week wins at four, is back to defend his title. He once ate 42 salmon in one sitting, and his fishing skills and patience are hard to beat. But Bear 747, winner of Fat Bear Week 2020, might give Otis a run for his money. He is one of the largest bears on earth, weighing as much as 1,400lb (635kg). Most bears know they can't compete with him. The winner of Fat Bear Week 2022 remains to be seen. Voting is open until 11 October - Fat Bear Tuesday - when the champion will be crowned. Until then, people can watch their favourite bears via livestream and follow their journey as they pile on their gains for the winter and feast at Alaska's Brooks River, located in Katmai National Park's sprawling eight million acre reserve.  Organisers of the "extremely popular" Fat Bear extravaganza say viewers tune in from almost every country in the world, and have taken quite a liking to the charismatic creatures. "It's fairly rare to get to know wild animals on an individual level," said Mike Fitz, founder of the inaugural Fat Bear Week in 2014 and the resident naturalist with explore.org, which operates the bear livestreams. Each bear has a unique story, Mr Fitz said, and some have developed quite the fan base. For example, Otis has a loyal following who enjoy his poise and calm in stressful hunting conditions. "[Otis] goes to his spot, he sits there, he waits for his meals to come to him, and it is a very successful strategy," Mr Fitz said. "He's the most patient bear that I have ever seen."Others marvel at the steadfastness of mother bears who are devoted to keeping their cubs safe and fed before they are forced to seek shelter from the cold. Fat Bear Week also teaches onlookers how North American brown bears prepare for the winter - by getting fat to survive. Bears emerge from their hibernation in the summer months weary and thin. They then spend their time hunting enormous amounts of fish. By October, they've put on so much weight that some are almost unrecognisable. In November, the bears start heading towards their dens where they will hibernate for six months. In that time, they don't eat, drink water, or pass urine or faeces."They're surviving at that time just on their body fat," Mr Fitz said, adding that they remain healthy throughout.Like its ursine* stars - [*definition: 'of, or to do with bears'] - Fat Bear Week seems to have hit its peak. Mr Fitz said votes on the first day, 5 October, had already surpassed last year's. As for who his favourite hefty hibernator is, Mr Fitz said he has officially endorsed Bear 747. "I think he is the fattest bear so he deserves the vote, but other people are welcome to disagree - and they often do," he said.</Text></Article><Article author="By Andrew Harding"><Text>Young children are dying in growing numbers in Somalia amid the worst drought to hit the country in 40 years. Government officials say that an even greater catastrophe could sweep the country within days or weeks unless more help arrives.The tears tumbled down 11-year-old Dahir's hunger-hollowed cheeks. "I just want to survive this," he said quietly. Seated beside the family's makeshift tent, on the dusty plain outside the city of Baidoa, his weary mother, Fatuma Omar, told him not to cry."Your tears will not bring your brother back. Everything will be fine," she said. Fatuma's second son, 10-year-old Salat, died of starvation two weeks ago, shortly after the family reached Baidoa from their village, three days' walk away. His body is buried in the rocky earth a few metres from their new home - the grave already covered in litter and increasingly hard to spot as new arrivals set up camp around them. "I cannot grieve for my son. There is no time. I need to find work and food to keep the others alive," Fatuma said, cradling her youngest daughter, nine-month-old Bille, and turning to look at six-year-old Mariam as she gave a rasping cough.On the other side of the dirt road that loops to the south-east, towards the coast and Somalia's capital, Mogadishu, other displaced families told more grim stories of long treks across a drought-parched landscape in search of food.  A new survey has shown that almost two-thirds of young children and pregnant women in the camps are suffering from acute malnutrition, which, along with a high death rate, could indicate that a localised declaration of famine is already overdue."I saw my daughter [three-year-old Farhir] die before me and I could do nothing," said Fatuma, who had walked for at least 15 days with her nine children from a village called Buulo Ciir to reach Baidoa."I had been carrying her for 10 days. We had to leave her by the side of the road. We had no strength to bury her. We could hear the hyenas closing in," she continued. "I've brought nothing with me. There is nothing left at home. The cattle are dead. The fields are dry," said Habiba Mohamud, 50, clutching a piece of twine in one hand, and acknowledging that she will never return to her village.A succession of droughts, turbo-charged by climate change, is now threatening to end a pastoral way of life that has endured for centuries across the Horn of Africa.Like other new arrivals, Habiba was busy erecting a tent for her family from branches, twigs, and scavenged scraps of cardboard and plastic sheeting, hoping to finish it before the chill of night. Only after that could she turn to finding food and medical help for some of her five children.On the admissions ward in the city's main hospital, Dr Abdullahi Yussuf moved between beds, checking on his tiny, emaciated patients. Most were children between two months and three years old. All were severely malnourished. Some had pneumonia and many were battling a new outbreak of measles too. Few infants had the strength to cry. Several had badly damaged skin, broken by the swelling that sometimes accompanies the most extreme cases of hunger. "So many die before they even reach a hospital," said Dr Abdullahi, watching his team struggling to connect an intravenous tube to the arm of a moaning two-year-old.Although Somali officials and international organisations have been sounding the alarm for months about an impending famine in this south-western region, Dr Abdullahi said his hospital was already short of basic items including nutritional supplements for children."Sometimes we lack supplies. It's terrifying, actually, because people are dying, and we can't support them. Our local government is not handling this well. It has not been planning for the drought or for the arrival of displaced families," he said, with visible frustration.A local government minister conceded there had been failings."We need to be faster than we are, and we need to be accurate… and more effective," said Nasir Arush, Minister for Humanitarian Affairs for South West state, on a short visit to one of the camps around Baidoa. But more international support, he insisted, was key."If we don't receive the aid we need, hundreds of thousands of people will die. The things we're doing now we needed to do three months ago. In reality we are behind. Unless something happens [fast] I think something catastrophic will happen in this area," he said.The process of formally declaring a famine can be a complicated one, reliant on hard-to-pin-down data, and, often, political considerations. Britain's ambassador in Mogadishu, Kate Foster, described it as "essentially, a technical process". She pointed out that during the 2011 drought "half of the 260,000 deaths happened before famine was declared".The presidential envoy leading Somalia's international effort to secure more funding thanked the US government, in particular, for recent new funding, saying it "has given us hope".But Abdirahman Abdishakur warned that without more help, a localised crisis in one part of Somalia could quickly spin out of control."We were raising the alarm… but the response of the international community was not adequate," Mr Abdishakur said."Famine is projected. It happens [already] in some places, some pockets, in Somalia, but still we can prevent the catastrophic one," he continued, speaking by phone during a stopover in Toronto, Canada.Although estimates vary, the population of Baidoa has roughly quadrupled in the past few months, to around 800,000 people. And any visitor will quickly notice one striking fact: almost all the new adult arrivals are women.Somalia is at war. The conflict has endured, in different guises, since the central government collapsed three decades ago, and it continues to affect almost every part of the country, tearing men away from their families to fight for an array of armed groups.Like most of those arriving in Baidoa, Hadija Abukar recently escaped from territory controlled by militant Islamist group al-Shabab."Even now I'm getting calls on my phone from the rest of my family. There is fighting there - between the government and al-Shabab. My relatives have run away and are hiding in the forest," she said, seated beside her sickly child at a small hospital in Baidoa.Other women spoke of husbands and older sons being blocked from leaving areas controlled by the militants, and of years of extortion by the group. Baidoa itself is not quite surrounded by al-Shabab, but it remains a precarious place of refuge. International aid organisations, and foreign journalists, require heavy security to move around, and any travel beyond the city limits is considered extremely risky."We're looking at populations that are under siege. Sometimes it feels quite hopeless," said Charles Nzuki, who heads the UN children's fund, Unicef, in central and southern Somalia.According to some estimates, more than half the population affected by the current drought remains in areas controlled by al-Shabab. Strict US government rules blocking any assistance from benefitting designated terrorist groups have complicated efforts to reach many desperate communities. But international organisations, and the Somali authorities, are working with smaller local partners to increase access and are now planning air drops into some contested territories. Still, one aid worker, speaking off the record, acknowledged that it was almost impossible to guarantee that no food or funds were reaching al-Shabab."Let's not be naïve, [al-Shabab] taxes everything, even cash donations," they said. Over the years, the militant group has established a reputation not just for violence and intimidation but for delivering justice in a country with a hard-earned reputation for official corruption. In at least four villages close to Baidoa, al-Shabab runs a network of Sharia courts that are routinely used by the city's residents and, reportedly, by people in Mogadishu and beyond, to settle business and land disputes. Further to the north-east, a sudden uprising against al-Shabab has seen local communities and clan militias - now heavily backed by the central government - drive the group out of dozens of towns and villages in recent weeks. The military successes have prompted a surge of optimism, but it is not clear if that will help in the fight against famine, or simply distract the Somali government."It might, or it might not [help]. I think it may create more [civilian] displacement. Or the government might liberate more areas and people might have more access [to aid]. So, we're looking at it from all sides," said local minister Nasir Arush.In Baidoa itself - a busy city of narrow, cobbled streets scarred by decades of conflict and neglect - the prices of basic goods, like rice, have doubled in the past month. Many residents blamed the drought, but others also looked further afield."Flour, sugar, oil - they've all risen by about the same amount. Sometimes we have to skip meals. I heard about the war between Russia and Ukraine. People say that is the root cause of these problems," said Shukri Moalim Ali, 38, walking over to her dry well, and barren vegetable patch.While the fight to ward off a deeper, spreading famine is the immediate focus in this region, Somalia's new government is also looking ahead, seeking to address more existential questions about the future."It is a challenging task, to respond to the drought, to fight against al-Shabab, and to campaign to access [international] climate justice finance," Abdirahman Abdishakur said."We have a young population, an enormous diaspora, and vibrant entrepreneurial skills. So that gives us hope. It's challenging, but we don't have an alternative."</Text></Article><Article author="By Katty Kay"><Text>The upcoming midterm elections for US Congress, the first nationwide vote since Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol nearly two years ago, have many Americans on edge. The BBC's Katty Kay has been finding out why.Karen and Steve don't want to take up arms. But if Republicans lose in November this elderly Arizona couple say a civil war is coming and, yes, they will fight. They have discussed it between them, and feel that taking up arms is their best option. It was at this point that our conversation grew a little dark and my faith in the strength of American democracy grew a little shaky. I met the Slatons at their Trump paraphernalia store in Show Low, Arizona. It was one of the first stops on a month-long road trip that I took around America this summer, a journey to understand why the upcoming elections feel so consequential, perhaps even a little ominous.The couple were delightful hosts. They were funny and generous. They took me on a tour of their extensive stock of whacky Trump merchandise and explained that, yes, there really are people who want a $100 life-size cut-out of the former president dressed as Rambo to put in their living rooms. Quite a lot of people actually. Trump as Rambo is one of their best selling items. We talked about history, the economy and even abortion. But it was only when I questioned their belief that the 2020 election was stolen that things got tense. Wasn't it possible, I asked, that millions of Americans just didn't like President Trump and so Joe Biden won the election? It was Karen who responded, with a distinctly steely glint: "If you're a crazy liberal, we're just not interested. The central news, let me call them, I'm not going to call them fake news, but it is fake news to say that America doesn't like Trump. America loves Trump."The BBC is not fake news, but I let that pass. The idea of war, however, demanded clarification. "It will start on a small scale, it will be like town against a town, state against a state," Steve had clearly thought this through. People have been tossing this idea of a second American civil war around for a couple of years now, ever since the 2020 election, ever since the violence of the Capitol Riots on 6 January, 2021. I find it hard to believe - maybe I lack imagination - but the idea of Americans going to war over a lost election still seems implausible. But that's Steve's take on what happened last time: "When Lincoln won, that triggered the South." That's not the only view of the origins of the American Civil War, but this wasn't the moment for a history debate; it's the present that needs attention. As I said goodbye to the Slatons, Steve threw out a warning. It was said with a habitual American friendly smile, but it was chilling nonetheless: "This could turn really nasty." Just how nasty was what I was trying to find out. You can watch Katty's hour-long film in the UK on iPlayer.In the US and Canada, it is available on BBC Select.And it will be broadcast on BBC World News on 8 and 9 October. Click on the links for details.Americans cast their ballots for control of Congress every two years. The congressional elections that fall in years when they aren't voting for president are called midterms. Because the White House isn't up for grabs, midterms generally don't get much attention and turnout hovers around 40%, lower than the 50-60% that vote in presidential elections. But this year feels different. This is the first national election since the storming of the Capitol and will test whether America can hold an election without violence. And, to be clear, the war talk from Americans like the Slatons is not normal pre-election rhetoric. In two and a half decades in America I've covered 10 US election cycles, I have never heard voters talk about politics in this violent way.Karen and Steve's views are not fringe views either. The belief that the 2020 election was stolen has seeped into the mainstream like a virus that now infects the entire democratic process. Polls since the election suggest that about 70% of Republicans believe Joe Biden is not the legitimate president. That's about one third of the American electorate, or more than 50 million people - not far off the population of Britain. This summer on a tour of Arizona, Wyoming, Georgia and Pennsylvania, I spoke to dozens of voters who are convinced Joe Biden is not America's legitimate president. If you felt an election had been stolen from you, you'd be angry too. Indeed, maybe you'd feel it was something worth fighting for. The problem is there is no evidence to support the stolen election claim. More than 60 lawsuits were brought by Trump's lawyers claiming election fraud. All but one was dismissed for lack of evidence. Some of the suits were even heard by Trump appointed judges, and they, too, tossed the cases out. Key Republican election officials in battleground states, like Arizona, and Georgia, also said the election process had been fair and accurate. There is no evidence of fraud that would have overturned Joe Biden's win. That hasn't stopped the fraud conspiracy virus from spreading. Trump may have launched it, but it has now spread across the country and taken on a life of its own. It is different from policy issues like gun rights or taxes. People have strong beliefs about those things too - Steve and Karen Slaton certainly did. But disagreements on those issues have facts that both sides can debate. The "election was stolen" is not a debatable issue. There are no facts on that side of the argument. In that way it's more like an unshakable belief system, and from my interviews I'm not sure the faithful would change their minds even if Trump himself were to suddenly say Biden won fair and square. The impact of this conspiracy on the US voting system was made clear to me in Georgia, in the election offices of Paulding County, where public officials are gearing up for the midterms with some trepidation. Deirdre Holden is an unelected civil servant with the job of Supervisor of Elections and Voter Registration. She is in charge of the mechanics of voting, making sure polling stations operate smoothly, ballots are collected safely and counted accurately. Holden doesn't tear up easily, but when she rereads the threat letter she received after the 2020 election she chokes, for just a second. "This election is effing rigged," it reads. (Deirdre is exceptionally polite, she has that wonderful Southern gentility, and she wants to spare me the profanities.) "Detonations will occur at every polling site in this county. No one at these places will be spared. If you think we're bluffing, eff-ing try. You've been warned. We will end you all." Deirdre puts down the letter and wipes her eye. If I got that message, I'd be afraid to come into work, but what I'm seeing isn't fear, it's anger. "I never was scared. I was mad. Mad that someone tries to threaten us, to threaten the people that just want to cast their vote. That didn't sit very well with me," Deirdre says. When her office in Paulding County (which by the way voted for Trump, though that really shouldn't matter) received that threat after the 2020 election, they passed it onto the FBI. Agents told her she ought to start parking her car outside her office window; it would help limit the force impact of an explosion, they explained. Deirdre wasn't the only election official to be targeted after that vote. The select committee investigating the Capitol Riot interviewed several witnesses who had been threatened, along with their families. After Al Schmidt, Philadelphia's elected Republican city commissioner, defended the election's integrity and confirmed Biden's win, he got one text that read, "You lied. You [are] a traitor. Perhaps 75 cuts and 20 bullets will arrive soon." The Brennan Center for Public Justice examined the aftermath of the 2020 election and concluded that threats against both elected and unelected election officials reached unprecedented levels. According to their findings, one in three election officials said they felt unsafe doing the job. Little surprise that large numbers quit after 2020. The question is why so much mistrust and anger now? Americans have been polarised for decades and this is not the first conspiracy theory to take hold here. But we haven't seen a storming of the US Capitol before, nor so many threats to election officials, nor so much attention paid to trying to change the election rules. How will new voting laws affect the election?Tracking Trump's 'extraordinary' endorsement spreeJoe Biden says Trump ideology threatens US democracyThe answer, most political observers suggest, is a confluence of events that allowed the election denying conspiracy to spread, thereby weakening the whole system. First, Trump started saying the vote would be rigged against him, long before the election even happened. He undermined trust before a single ballot was cast. Then, election rules changed in 2020 to accommodate Covid restrictions. Election deniers say those changes, which included more early voting and more postal votes, left the system open to widespread fraud (though there's no evidence of that.) The Brennan report also points to the impact of social media. "In 2020, political actors ramped up the lies about election processes, often on social media" the report found. "This disinformation has indelibly changed the lives and careers of election officials." Almost 80% of election officials, according to the report, say the rise of misinformation has made their jobs more difficult. Over a half say it has made them more dangerous. "People just have lost their trust. And that's what breaks my heart," says election official Deirdre Holden. And like the Slatons, she leaves me with a warning - November's midterms are going to be worse. Deirdre is non-partisan. I spent a few hours with her and I can honestly say I have no idea how she votes. That's exactly as it should be. The running of democratic elections should be in the hands of officials who have no bias. The people who organise the voting, count the ballots and certify the results should not inject their own politics into the process. When they do, trust is lost. And in this respect, the dispute over 2020 has shown the American system to be uniquely vulnerable. The US is the only Western democracy where the senior election officials are not civil servants. At the state level, it is the post of secretary of state that runs the election. And that person is elected, as a Democrat or a Republican. This November there are some 200 Republicans on the ballot who say they believe the 2020 election was stolen. In at least seven states there are election deniers on the ballot who could have a direct impact on voting systems. In a close election in 2024, those people could be key in deciding who wins the White House.One of those critical posts is a state's secretary of state. In the past it was a post that got very little attention in election campaigns. It was almost an afterthought and certainly not a position that would get national or even international press attention. So the fact that I found myself flying over the desert in a private plane interviewing Arizona's candidate for secretary of state this summer, is a telling indication of how this midterm election is different. In a world where election results are contested, the secretary of state suddenly becomes very important. They have the ability to change the way people are allowed to vote and even change the rules around the count. Trump fully understands the significance of this post - on 2 January 2021 he famously called Georgia's Secretary of State, Brad Raffensperger, and urged the Republican to "find" him an extra 11,780 votes so that Trump could win the state. Raffensperger denied Trump's request. Now the former president wants to make sure that he has allies in the job of secretary of state, so that if he runs in 2024, he can count on them to help him out. In the run-up to the midterm elections, money and attention, from both parties, is pouring into the secretary of state races in half a dozen battleground states. Which is why I spent the day, and a terrifyingly bumpy plane ride, with Mark Finchem. And also why he had a private jet at his disposal in the first place. Joe Biden won Arizona by a mere 10,000 votes. Finchem is a staunch election denier who believes Trump was robbed in the state and would like to overturn the 2020 result. If he's elected this November, he plans to ban voting by mail (the preferred choice of 80% of Arizona's electorate), ban early voting, and do away with electronic voting machines - all by 2024, the next presidential contest. He says he just wants to eliminate any chance for fraud.Inflation might get her to vote Trump againMeet the BBC's 'undercover voters'His critics say Finchem is a threat to democracy who wants to control the voting process in a way that could swing the vote in Republicans' favour. One Republican state representative has even broken with Finchem and is backing his Democratic opponent in the race. Finchem has a mix of charm and vehemence that is disarming. He told me he doesn't believe Democrats could ever win Arizona, not in 2020, not in 2022 and not in 2024. He is running against Democrat Adrian Fontes and appears well positioned to win the race. In September, a poll by OH Predictive Insights showed Finchem leading Fontes 40%-35%. So, a man who says the last election was rigged and who also doesn't believe Republicans can lose the state could well end up in charge of running elections. It's not hard to see where this could go. If Finchem, and other candidates like him around the country, change the voting system in ways that make it almost impossible for their side to lose, then, come 2024, Democrats, with some reason, won't trust the results either. They will say they were robbed of victory. It won't be many voting cycles before no one trusts election results here. As I travelled thousands of miles across the country it was clear both sides believe America's democracy is in peril, for very different reasons. Each side blames the other.There's no obvious solution to this spiral of mistrust. Across the nation I heard anger, anxiety, even talk of violence. We are watching these midterms so closely, in part because of the attack of January 6th and in part because they will help set the stage for whether Donald Trump runs again. 2024 is just around the corner. It is likely to be a tumultuous couple of years. </Text></Article><Article author="By Alexandra Fouché in London &amp; Hugo Bachega in Kyiv"><Text>A large fire on the only crossing between the occupied Crimean peninsula and Russia was caused by a lorry explosion, Russian officials say.A blast on the road section led to oil tankers on the rail section catching fire, before the road collapsed.Crimea was annexed in 2014 by Russia, which now uses the bridge to move military equipment into Ukraine. The official Twitter account of the Ukraine government responded to the fire by tweeting: "Sick burn."An adviser to Ukraine's President Zelensky, Mykhailo Podolyak, did not directly claim Ukrainian responsibility, but wrote: "Crimea, the bridge, the beginning."Everything illegal must be destroyed, everything stolen must be returned to Ukraine, everything occupied by Russia must be expelled."Meanwhile, the Ukraine defence ministry compared the bridge explosion to the sinking of Russia's Moskva missile cruiser in April."Two notorious symbols of Russian power in Ukrainian Crimea have gone down," it tweeted. "What's next in line?"The Russian foreign ministry said "the Kiev regime's reaction towards destruction of civilian infrastructure is a testament to its terrorist nature".LIVE UPDATES: Blast causes only Crimea-Russia bridge to collapseExcitement and fear in Ukraine after bridge blastIt is hard to exaggerate the significance, and symbolism, of seeing the bridge on fire. Opened by President Putin in 2018, it was meant to symbolise that Crimea was Russian.Russia has used the bridge to move military equipment, ammunition, and personnel from Russia to battlefields in southern Ukraine. As such, Ukrainian authorities said it was a legitimate target, as they vow to retake the peninsula.Any attack on Crimea, where the Russian army has a massive presence, will be seen as another massive humiliation for the Kremlin.     The bridge is particularly hated by Ukrainians. Social media in Ukraine erupted in celebration on seeing the fire - one day after Russian President Vladimir Putin turned 70. Road and rail traffic across the bridge has been suspended. Local authorities in Crimea say they will organise a ferry service between the Russian mainland and the peninsula.Russia's National Anti-Terrorism Committee said: "At 06:07 Moscow time today [03:07 GMT], an explosion was set off at a cargo vehicle on the motorway part of the Crimean bridge on the side of the Taman peninsula, which set fire to seven fuel tanks of a train that was en route to the Crimean peninsula. "Two motorway sections of the bridge partially collapsed."Crimean parliamentary speaker Vladimir Konstantinov blamed the explosion on "Ukrainian vandals, who have finally managed to reach their bloody hands to the Crimean bridge".He added the damage to the bridge would be "promptly restored, since it is not of a serious nature".President Putin has been briefed about the "emergency" on the bridge and has ordered a government inquiry, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, in comments quoted by Interfax news agency.A criminal investigation is also under way.The 19km (12-mile) bridge across the Kerch Strait, which cost £2.7bn to build, was opened by President Putin four years after Moscow illegally annexed Crimea. It is the longest bridge in Europe, and was hailed by Russian media as "the construction of the century". Russian officials previously claimed it was well protected from threats from air, land or water.The crossing is more than 100 miles from Ukrainian-held territory. One explosives expert told the BBC the fire was probably not caused by a missile."The lack of obvious blast / fragmentation damage on the road surface suggests that an air-delivered weapon was not used," he said.He said it was possible that "a well-planned attack from below may have been the cause"."I suspect explosives on the road bridge and train deck were initiated near simultaneously using coded radio command," he added.Ukraine claimed responsibility last month for a series of air strikes on Crimea over the summer, including an attack on Russia's Saky military base.Kyiv has the momentum in this conflict. The army has reclaimed large swathes of territory, forcing Russian troops to abandon long-held positions. Amid the losses, Moscow has begun a chaotic military mobilisation - which led to rare anti-war protests in Russia, and a huge exodus of military-age men.On Russian TV talk shows, presenters and studio guests have been expressing increasing doom and gloom about the situation. </Text></Article><Article author="By Hugo Bachega and John Simpson"><Text>Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky says Russian officials have begun to "prepare their society" for the possible use of nuclear weapons, but added he does not believe Russia is ready to use them. In an interview with the BBC, President Zelensky denied having urged strikes on Russia, claiming that an earlier remark had been mistranslated. "You must use preventive kicks," he said, referring to sanctions, "not attacks".In recent weeks, the Ukrainian army has recaptured large swathes of territory in a successful counter-offensive that has forced Russian troops to abandon long-held positions. In what Kyiv describes as Moscow's response to its defeats, President Vladimir Putin has incorporated four partially occupied regions of Ukraine.The annexations, widely dismissed as illegal, have raised fears of a possible escalation in the seven-month war. President Putin and other senior Russian officials have suggested that nuclear weapons - possibly smaller, tactical weapons - could be used to defend those areas, although Western officials say there has been no evidence Moscow is prepared to do so.Speaking in English at the president's office in Kyiv, President Zelensky said: "They begin to prepare their society. That's very dangerous. "They are not ready to do it, to use it. But they begin to communicate. They don't know whether they'll use or not use it. I think it's dangerous to even speak about it."Then, in Ukrainian, he said through a translator: "What we see is that Russia's people in power like life and thus I think the risk of using nuclear weapons is not that definite as some experts say, because they understand that there is no turning back after using it, not only the history of their country, but themselves as personalities." However, he denied having called for strikes on Russia during an online event on Thursday, saying the Ukrainian word he had used had been misunderstood. The initial comment was denounced by Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as "an appeal to start yet another world war", while Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said it demonstrated why Russia was right to launch its operation in Ukraine."After that translation," President Zelensky said, "they [the Russians] did their way, how it's useful for them, and began to retranslate it in other directions."The interview happened hours after US President Joe Biden said that the Russian threat to use nuclear weapons had brought the world closer to "Armageddon" than at any time since the Cuban Missile Crisis during the Cold War.President Zelensky said action was needed now, as Russia's threats were a "risk for the whole planet". Moscow, he claimed, had "made a step already" by occupying the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe's largest nuclear station which President Putin is trying to turn into Russian property.   Around 500 Russian troops were at the plant, he said, although the Ukrainian staff still operate it."The world can stop urgently the actions of Russian occupiers," President Zelensky said. "The world can implement the sanction package in such cases and do everything to make them leave the nuclear power plant."Empowered by sophisticated Western-supplied weapons, the Ukrainian army has made significant advances in the east and the south, reclaiming towns and villages even in areas the Kremlin claims are now part of Russia. President Zelensky said Russian forces were putting up a "good enough fight", but that Ukraine had received weapons - "I won't say we have enough now" - and soldiers were motivated to push forward.The Russian military's setbacks, a major embarrassment for President Putin, have sparked unusual criticism of the country's military.Amid the losses, President Putin announced the mobilisation of hundreds of thousands of reservists, which led to rare anti-war protests in Russia and to a huge exodus of military-age men.President Zelensky urged Russians to "fight for your body, rights and soul", saying: "Those mobilised kids now, they come with nothing. Without guns or armour. They are being thrown here like cannon fodder... If they want to be kebabs - fine, let them come. But if they are people after all and think that this is their lives, they have to fight. "Everything Putin is afraid of, and it's not the nuclear hit, he is afraid of his community," he said. He's afraid of his people. Because only those people are capable of replacing him nowadays. Take away his power. Give it to someone else."Asked whether President Putin could survive in an eventual Ukrainian win in the war, he said: "I don't care."</Text></Article><Article author="By Paul Adams"><Text>Ukraine is exploding with excitement this morning.Videos of the damaged Crimean bridge have spread like wildfire on social media; this is already being compared to the sinking of the Russian warship Moskva in April."The guided missile cruiser Moskva and the Kerch bridge - two notorious symbols of Russian power in Ukrainian Crimea - have gone down," tweeted Ukraine's ministry of defence."What's next in line, Russkies?" it went on.Ukraine's inventive social media activists are gleefully pumping out memes to celebrate the occasion. And Ukraine's second largest bank, Monobank, says it has already issued a new debit card design featuring the collapsed bridge.Oleksii Danilov, Secretary of Ukraine's National Security Council, wasn't the only one noting that the attack came just a day after Vladimir Putin's 70th birthday, tweeting a video of the damaged bridge next to Marilyn Monroe's famous performance of Happy Birthday, Mr President from 1962.The sense of excitement is palpable.Coming on the back of weeks of mostly good news from the battlefront, where Ukrainian forces continue to take back territory seized by Russia back in February and March, the sight of the crippled, burning bridge is a massive additional boost to morale.Bridge explosion 'the beginning', says Zelensky adviserHow was this done? Any number of theories are doing the rounds - from a Ukrainian special forces operation to the work of partisans in Crimea, a missile strike, or even a suicide bomb."This is a masterpiece of clandestine sabotage," a former senior British army explosives expert told me. "A well-planned attack from below may have been the cause," he said. "With structural demolition, you always plan a 'collapse mechanism' which lets the weight of the structure do the majority of the work."Ukrainian officials are giving little away, happy to apply the same level of ambiguity that followed a mysterious attack on the Russian airbase in Crimea in August.But the attacks on the Saky base and the bridge are all part of the same wider effort: to undermine Russia's ability to use Crimea as a launch pad for its war in southern Ukraine. The road and railway bridges are vital links in Russia's supply chain. Without them, Moscow will find it even harder to send troops and equipment to repel Ukraine's offensive north of Kherson.Kyiv is also saying to Moscow: Crimea is ours and eventually we are going to take it back. For all the giddy delight ricocheting across social media, some Ukrainians are anxious.This morning, we left the city of Zaporizhzhia, which is still in shock after Russian missile attacks on Thursday, which left at least 17 civilians dead.People there suspect that they are being punished by Russia as Moscow lashes out after its recent military failures. They fear the coming days may bring more. </Text></Article><Article author="By Merlyn Thomas"><Text>Haiti has asked for foreign military support to curb its gang violence crisis which has paralysed the country.The Haitian government authorised Prime Minister Ariel Henry to request armed help due to "the risk of a major humanitarian crisis". The US meanwhile urged its citizens in Haiti to leave due to the insecurity.A group of powerful gangs have blocked the country's main fuel terminal since September, crippling its basic supplies like water and food.It is not clear to whom the request for intervention has been sent to, and in what form the help would be given.The UN said it had not received an official request from Haiti's government."That being said, we remain extremely concerned about the security situation in Haiti, the impact its having on the Haitian people, on our ability to do our work, especially in the humanitarian sphere," said UN spokesperson, Stephane Dujarric.The US is also considering a request for a humanitarian corridor to restore fuel distribution within Haiti, according to state department spokesperson Vedant Patel.Mr Patel did not say where the troops to support this would come from.Varreux fuel terminal has been controlled and blockaded by a coalition of powerful gangs since last month, which has ground the whole country to a halt. Some hospitals have shut, while businesses and transport services stopped working in protest of destitution. Civil unrest escalated since Mr Henry announced an end to government fuel subsidies on 11 September, which sent petrol and diesel prices skyrocketing.Since then, protests and looting have intensified, with the capital, Port-au-Prince, at the heart of it. Food aid warehouses have been targeted, with an estimated $5m (£4.6m) worth of food aid lost in repeated attacks, according to Haiti's UN envoy. It is unclear whether the Haitian government request for foreign military intervention would mean the return of UN peacekeeping troops, after leaving five years ago. The UN's presence has left a mixed legacy in Haiti: its peacekeepers accepted partial responsibility for sparking a cholera epidemic more than a decade ago which killed about 10,000 people. Haiti's government said eight people had died on Sunday from cholera, for the first time in three years - raising concerns over the potential for a health crisis too. Of the many supplies that have been blocked by the country's gangs, clean water is a vital one - especially as cholera is spread via contaminated water. Haiti is one of the poorest countries in the world and has suffered a number of recent crises, most notably the assassination of its president, Jovenel Moïse, in July 2021 and a massive earthquake that left more than 2,200 people dead just a month later.Deaths are frequent, with more than 200 people killed in gang violence in Port-au-Prince in the space of just 10 days in July, according to figures from the UN.</Text></Article><Article author="By Merlyn Thomas"><Text>Ukraine says two mass burial sites have been found in the recently-recaptured eastern town of Lyman, after Russian retreated.The Ukrainian governor of the Donetsk region, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said one burial site had about 200 individual graves containing civilian bodies.It was unclear how many bodies the second site held, but it may contain both soldiers and civilians, he said.The time and cause of death for the deceased is yet to be determined. The BBC was not able to independently verify the claims. Mr Kyrylenko, writing on Telegram, said officials had begun investigating both burial sites. He also asked people not to speculate on the details until the investigation was completed.Russia withdrew its troops from the strategic town of Lyman, in a significant setback for its campaign in eastern Ukraine. Lyman is in Donetsk - one of four partially-occupied Ukrainian regions which Moscow declared it was annexing. Ukraine and its Western allies have dismissed the move as an illegal land-grab.Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has previously accused Russia of deliberately killing civilians in other locations in Ukraine.Mr Zelensky said that mass graves were found this spring in Bucha, near the capital Kyiv, and also near Mariupol - the key south-eastern Ukrainian port now occupied by Russia since its invasion of Ukraine in February.Investigators and journalists found what appeared to be evidence of the deliberate killing of civilians in Bucha and other nearby areas.Ukrainian forces said they found mass graves and evidence that civilians had been killed after their feet and hands were bound.Hundreds of graves were also found outside the eastern city of Izyum days after Russian troops retreated, according to Ukrainian authorities. It is unclear what happened to the victims, but early accounts suggest some may have died from shelling and a lack of access to healthcare. </Text></Article><Article author="By Omar Wally"><Text>A red toy motorbike sits in the corner of Mariam Kuyateh's home gathering dust.It was meant for her 20-month-old son, Musa, but he passed away in September. He is one of the 66 children in The Gambia who are thought to have died after being given a cough syrup that had been "potentially linked with acute kidney injuries", according to the World Health Organization.No-one in the family touches Musa's toy - a reminder of what has been lost.His 30-year-old mother, who has four other children, was in tears remembering what had happened to her son.Sitting in her home in a suburb of The Gambia's largest city, Serrekunda, she explained that his sickness started as a flu. After he was seen by a doctor, her husband bought a syrup to treat the problem."When we gave him the syrup, the flu stopped, but it led to another problem," Ms Kuyateh said. "My son was not passing urine."She returned to the hospital and Musa was sent for a blood test, which ruled out malaria. He was given another treatment, which did not work, and then a catheter was fitted, but he did not pass urine.Finally, the small child was operated on. There was no improvement."He couldn't make it, he died."Earlier this week, the WHO issued a global alert over four cough syrups in connection with the deaths in The Gambia.The products - Promethazine Oral Solution, Kofexmalin Baby Cough Syrup, Makoff Baby Cough Syrup and Magrip N Cold Syrup - were manufactured by an Indian company, Maiden Pharmaceuticals, which had failed to provide guarantees about their safety, the WHO said.The Indian government is investigating the situation. The firm has not responded to a BBC request for comment.There is a lot of anger in The Gambia over what has happened. There are growing calls for the resignation of Health Minister Dr Ahmadou Lamin Samateh, along with the prosecution of the importers of the drugs into the country."Sixty-six is a huge number. So we need justice, because the victims were innocent children," Ms Kuyateh said.Five-month-old Aisha was another victim.Her mother, Mariam Sisawo, realised one morning that after having taken the cough syrup, her baby was not passing urine.On an initial visit to the hospital, the 28-year-old was told that there was nothing wrong with her daughter's bladder. It took two more trips there on consecutive days before Aisha was referred to a hospital in the capital, Banjul, which was 36km (22 miles) away from their home in BrikamaBut after five days of treatment there, she died."My daughter had a painful death. At a certain time when the doctors wanted to fix a drip on her, they could not see her veins. Myself and two other women in the same ward, we all lost our children."I have two sons and Aisha was the only girl. My husband was very happy to have Aisha and he still can't come to terms with her death." The Gambia does not currently have a laboratory capable of testing whether medicines are safe and so they have to be sent abroad for checking, Gambia health services director Mustapha Bittay told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme.But Ms Sisawo believes the government should be more vigilant."This is a lesson for parents, but the greater responsibility is with the government. Before any drugs get in to the country, they should be properly checked if they are fit for human consumption or not," she said.Isatou Cham was too distressed to talk about the death of her two-year-and-five-month-old son, Muhammed.She left the living room of their home in Serrekunda crying with her two other children.Muhammed's father, Alieu Kijera, explained what had happened to his little boy.He said he was taken to hospital when he had a fever and was unable to pass urine. But the doctors were treating Muhammed for malaria and his condition was getting worse.The medics then said he should be treated in neighbouring Senegal, where the health service is thought to be better, but while there was some improvement, it still did not save him.Mr Kijera is angry that his country does not have a good enough health system and he was forced to travel abroad. "If there was equipment and the right medicine, then my son and many other children could have been saved," he said.</Text></Article><Article author="BBC News"><Text>The school district in Uvalde, Texas, has suspended its entire police force following protests by parents of children killed in a shooting there. The suspension will be indefinite, the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District (UCISD) said in a statement.Recent developments "have uncovered additional concerns with department operations", it added. Nineteen children and two teachers died in the attack at Robb Elementary School on 24 May.Police have been accused of botching the response to the fatal shooting.A July investigation into the shooting by the Texas legislature found "systemic failures and egregiously poor decision-making" by those involved in the response.The UCISD is responsible for supervising the security of schools in the Uvalde area, including Robb Elementary.The school district's police force consisted of five officers and one security guard, according to its website.Their officers were among the first of nearly 400 police to respond to the attack by a rifle-wielding 19-year-old gunman, who was eventually shot and killed by a border patrol agent.State troopers have been asked to help provide security for the school district, the UCISD statement said.There are still two ongoing investigations into the police response to the school shooting. It recently emerged that a police officer newly hired by the Uvalde school district is being looked into for her conduct on the day of the shooting, while she was working as a state trooper. Officer Crimson Elizondo was fired from the force on Thursday. Also on Friday, the acting district police chief was placed on administrative leave while the director of student services of the Uvalde school district announced his decision to retire.Parent of the shooting's victims have been camped outside school offices for days. They praised the district's decision to suspend the entire police force."They don't know how to hire people, they don't know how to vet officers," mother Kimberly Rubio, told ABC News, adding that the move to suspend the entire force is "what we've been asking for - it's more than we've been asking for".The former head of the police department for the school district, Pete Arredondo, was fired in August. He was one of the first officers on the scene that day, and received much of the blame for the botched response. The Texas Department of Public Safety has said that Mr Arredondo wrongly told officers under his command to treat the situation as if they were dealing with a barricaded gunman rather than an active shooter, which would have prompted a more urgent enforcement reaction. </Text></Article><Article author="BBC News"><Text>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has declared a state of emergency to address a "crisis situation" over an influx of migrants.More than 17,000 have arrived in the city from the southern border since April.Republican states like Texas, Arizona and Florida have been sending migrants to Democratic areas in recent months. It's part of a row with the White House as unprecedented numbers of people arrive at the US-Mexico border.Since September, an average of five to six buses have been arriving in the city each day, Mr Adams said at a press conference on Friday. He said that one in five people in the city shelter system is currently an asylum seeker. Many of those arriving are families with school-aged children and are in serious need of medical care, he said. The influx is on track to cost New York $1bn (£900m) this fiscal year, and the mayor is calling for federal and state funding to help with the costs. "New Yorkers are angry," said Mayor Adams. "I am angry too. We have not asked for this. There was never any agreement to take on the job of supporting thousands of asylum seekers."He added: "The city is going to run out of funding for other priorities. New York City is doing all we can, but we are reaching the outer limit of our ability to help."The city's social services are "being exploited by others for political gain", he added.Three states - Texas, Arizona and Florida  - have transported migrants to Democratic-led areas, focusing on self-proclaimed "sanctuary" cities that limit their co-operation with federal immigration authorities.Why are migrants being sent to Democrat-run areas?Republican officials in border states say the tactic is aimed at mitigating the impact of migration flows.They have also said the measure is designed to increase pressure on the administration of President Joe Biden to do more to reduce the number of migrants crossing the southern US border, which has hit a record high this year.The Democratic-run city of El Paso, Texas, has been offering migrants free rides to New York City and Chicago as a means of alleviating the strain on city resources. El Paso alone has transported more than double the number of migrants - nearly 9,000 - to the two northern cities than have been sent by the Texas governor.El Paso officials say the rides are voluntary, and that they co-ordinate with the destination cities to help the migrants upon arrival. As part of his emergency declaration, the New York mayor issued an executive order that allows the city to dedicate resources to support the asylum seekers and expedite any response efforts. A spokeswoman for Texas Governor Greg Abbott dismissed the declaration by the mayor on Friday."The true emergency is on our nation's southern border where small Texas border towns are overrun and overwhelmed by hundreds of migrants every single day as the Biden administration dumps them in their communities," said Renae Eze.Ms Eze said that, as of October, Texas had sent around 3,100 migrants arriving in the state to New York on more than 60 buses.</Text></Article><Article author="By Patrick Jackson"><Text>A tractor is one of the odder gifts for Vladimir Putin, as Russia's president, a pariah in the West since his invasion of Ukraine, turns 70.It was given him by his Belarusian ally, Alexander Lukashenko, whose country boasts a tractor works.Mr Lukashenko confirmed the news as he visited his fellow strongman's home city, St Petersburg, for talks.Mr Putin was hosting other leaders of ex-Soviet states as the war fanned by his invasion raged.Faced with successful Ukrainian counter-attacks, he hinted at problems this week, describing the situation in regions he recently annexed as "restive".But on Friday, his allies lavished praise and gifts on the man who has led Russia, whether as president or prime minister, for more than two decades.Mr Lukashenko, Europe's self-styled "last dictator" who has been in power even longer than the Russian leader (since 1994) and whose administration is also under Western sanctions, came to St Petersburg with a gift certificate for the Belarusian-made vehicle.Belarus, Ukraine, Russia activists win Nobel prizeThe Minsk Tractor Works is the flagship of Belarusian industry.It was not immediately clear how Mr Putin responded to the big-wheeled gift, which had to compete with mountains of melons and watermelons from Tajikistan's President, Emomali Rahmon.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterHowever, it is a fact that Mr Putin has been frequently seen in tractors for some years now.Along with the gifts came praise for Mr Putin for "transforming the image of Russia, strengthening its sovereignty and its defence capability, and protecting its national interests", in the words of the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill."The number one patriot in the world" was how Ramzan Kadyrov, Chechnya's Moscow-backed leader, put it.Further afield, but dealing with similar international isolation, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un congratulated the man in the Kremlin for "crushing the challenges and threats of the United States".Mr Putin's enemies used the occasion of his birthday again to depict him as a war criminal trying to destroy another country while ruining his own.Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov called on Russia's military to reject him and refuse to fight his war, saying Mr Putin was "hiding in a bunker rather than standing" with his soldiers.Some social media users noted the irony of Mr Lukashenko's gift to Mr Putin: the humble tractor became an early symbol of Ukrainian resistance to the Russian invasion after farmers were seen towing away abandoned military vehicles.     In the Czech capital, Prague, demonstrators mocked Russia's president with a giant dummy depicting him as a naked emperor sitting on a golden toilet.  </Text></Article><Article author="BBC News"><Text>A jailed Belarus activist and two groups from Ukraine and Russia have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for championing human rights and democracy.The decision to honour Ales Bialiatsky, Russia's Memorial and the Ukrainian Centre for Civil Liberties (CCL) is a rebuff to two authoritarian leaders.Russia forced Memorial to close last December, ahead of Vladimir Putin's decision to invade Ukraine.Bialiatsky was imprisoned amid protests against Belarus's Alexander Lukashenko.Ukraine's CCL has monitored political persecutions and crimes against humanity in areas of the country occupied or annexed by Russia.Norwegian Nobel Committee head Berit Reiss-Andersen told reporters that all three had made "an outstanding effort to document war crimes, human right abuses and the abuse of power".Asked whether the committee was sending a signal to Russia's leader on his 70th birthday, she pointed out that the Nobel prize was always awarded "for something and to somebody and not against anyone".Belarus's long-time ruler is a close ally of President Putin. After a re-election in 2020 that was widely condemned as rigged, he brutally cracked down on protesters and then allowed Russian forces to use his country as a launchpad in its war against Ukraine.ANALYSIS: Putin's dream of victory slips away in UkraineAles Bialiatsky, 60, founded Belarus rights group Viasna, which means spring, in 1996, two years after Mr Lukashenko came to power. He was first jailed in 2011, then last year, he was detained again without charge. He is one of 1,348 people who Viasna says are currently held as political prisoners in Belarus.Exiled opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya praised the Nobel committee's "recognition for all Belarusians fighting for freedom and democracy" and Bialiatsky's wife Natallia Pinchuk said she was "overwhelmed with emotion".A foreign ministry spokesman in Minsk said Alfred Nobel was "turning in his grave" following the decision to hand Bialiatsky the Nobel Peace Prize.Memorial is one of the oldest human rights groups in Russia. Led initially by another Peace Prize laureate, Andrei Sakharov, in the late 1980s, its work uncovered the true scale of Joseph Stalin's repression in the form of Gulag camps of forced labour, where tens of millions of people are thought to have died.But it went on to document more recent human rights abuses, including kidnappings and torture in the Russian republic of Chechnya. The head of its Chechen branch, Natalia Estemirova, was murdered in 2009. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterIn December 2021, Russia's Supreme Court liquidated Memorial, although it continues to operate in a harsh climate where criticism of the war in Ukraine is considered a criminal offence.The head of International Memorial, Elena Zhemkova, told the BBC that the Nobel prize would help their work: "We always said at Memorial that memory of the past and human rights have no boundaries. To understand the Soviet past demands joint efforts. No country can privatise the memory about the war and repression."However, officials in Moscow were less impressed. The head of Russia's human rights council, Valery Fadeyev, urged Memorial to reject the prize, describing it as completely discredited, Tass news agency reports.Although a Ukrainian organisation was jointly awarded the peace prize, there was some annoyance in Kyiv that it was shared with representatives of Belarus and Russia. "Neither Russian nor Belarusian organisations were able to organise resistance to the war. This year's Nobel is 'awesome'," tweeted presidential adviser Mikhailo Podolyak sarcastically.Ukraine's Centre for Civil Liberties has in recent months turned its attention to abuses committed by Russian forces, after spending the previous years documenting political persecution in Russian-annexed Crimea and crimes in areas of eastern Ukraine run by Russian-backed separatists.The centre's head, Oleksandra Matviychuk, said she was delighted they were sharing the prize with "our friends and partners at Memorial and Viasna". In order to give the hundreds of thousands of victims of war crimes a chance of justice, she said an international tribunal should be created to "bring Putin, Lukashenko and other war criminals to justice". </Text></Article><Article author="By Mark Lowen in Rome and Elsa Maishman in London"><Text>Central heating will be restricted in Italy this winter, as it becomes the latest country to take action on European gas supply shortages sparked by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Under a new government decree, buildings will face an extra fifteen days without central heating. Italians will also be told to turn their heating down by one degree, and off for an extra hour a day. Some buildings will be exempt, including nurseries and hospitals.The move comes as governments across Europe look to reduce demand and shore up energy supplies ahead of winter. Many were dependent on gas from Russia, which has been restricted following the war in Ukraine. Before February's invasion, Italy was the second-largest importer of Russian gas in the EU, with imports making up 40% of its total supply. This is now down to just 10%, as Rome has turned to other sources of energy and liquified natural gas. The country normally restricts the use of central heating in warmer months, with its use determined by regional governments. With bills already soaring, reactions from Italians have been mixed."For old people who will stay at home a lot of time, probably it will be a problem for them," one told the BBC."It's probably needed, but it's hard. Now that this crisis is affecting us personally, it could lead more people to change their view on still backing sanctions on Russia," said another.How are countries tackling energy bills? EU leaders consider how to cap gas pricesHow can the world cope without Russian oil and gas?Many European governments have announced similar energy-saving plans. In France, homes and offices will be heated to a maximum of 19C, there will be no hot water in public buildings, and the temperature in swimming pools and gyms will also be reduced. A ban on doors being left open in heated or air-conditioned shops, which was previously in effect in some areas, has been extended nationwide. Spain has also previously mandated that heating not rise above 19C, as well as ordering that doors should be closed so as not to waste heat and that lights in shop windows must be turned off after 22:00.And Germany has stopped lighting up public monuments and buildings for aesthetic reasons, and warned heating may be turned off in the entrances, corridors and foyers of public buildings. At an EU summit in Prague on Friday, leaders are discussing capping wholesale gas prices to protect consumers.Many individual states have already introduced national caps on the price consumers pay for units of energy. Other measures have already been agreed across the bloc, including windfall taxes on surplus profits made by fossil fuel companies, and a levy on excess profits made by non-gas electricity producers.</Text></Article><Article author="By Nathan Williams"><Text>A fire has damaged the enigmatic statues on Easter Island, with some of the charring said to be irreparable. An unknown number of the stone-carved statues have been affected by the blaze, Chile's cultural heritage undersecretary said.Easter Island has nearly 1,000 of the megaliths, known as moai. They have oversized heads and generally stand about 4m (13ft) high. They were carved by a Polynesian tribe more than 500 years ago. The fire, which broke out on Monday, affected nearly 60 hectares (148 acres), cultural heritage official Carolina Perez Dattari tweeted.It is reported to have been started deliberately, and is centred around Easter Island's Rano Raraku volcano - which is a Unesco World Heritage Site.Easter Island lies 3,500km (2,174 miles) off the coast of Chile. It relies on tourism and reopened just three months ago following its closure during the Covid-19 pandemic. The site has now been closed again while a conservation team examines the extent of the damage.The island's Mayor, Pedro Edmunds, told local media: "The damage caused by the fire can't be undone." The are some 1,000 giant stone statues and carvings on Easter Island, the largest of which weigh 74 tonnes and stand 10m tall.The figures were carved by the indigenous Rapa Nui people sometime between the years of 1400 and 1650, and positioned to form a ring around the island, facing inland.They were figures of spiritual devotion for the Rapa Nui, embodying the spirit of a prominent ancestor. Each one was considered to be the person's living incarnation.</Text></Article><Article author="By Guy Hedgecoe"><Text>Spanish prosecutors are investigating a group of male university students filmed chanting obscene misogynistic abuse at female students in Madrid.Videos have circulated for days of abuse being hurled from the windows of an all-male student building late on Sunday at women in the block opposite.Spanish PM Pedro Sánchez criticised the "macho, inexplicable, unjustified and absolutely repugnant behaviour". It has drawn political condemnation and triggered widespread debate. One student shouted: "Whores, come out of your holes, bunnies. You are a load of nymphomaniac whores."Then, in a choreographed move, fellow students across the Colegio Mayor Elías Ahuja building pulled opened their blinds and started shouting and making animal noises. As Sunday night's video of students from Complutense University went viral, there was an immediate backlash from politicians across the spectrum.Socialist party prime minister Mr Sánchez said: "We should not give any excuse for these behaviours which surely don't represent the general feeling of Spanish society."I think it's important that all political parties and the media express a clear 'no' to these macho behaviours, and do not give a take a single step back on real equality between men and women."The leader of the conservative opposition Popular Party, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, called for society "to finish with these intolerable sexist attitudes".  Madrid's public prosecutor has opened an investigation to decide whether the incident amounts to a hate crime. The scandal has left the Elías Ahuja residence under national scrutiny. In a statement it said the episode had been "incomprehensible and inadmissible" and "contrary to the ideas and values" of the institution. It has expelled the alleged ringleader and said that others involved will attend a course on gender equality.  However, some of the residents of the Santa Mónica all-female building, which was the target of the abuse, have apparently defended the male students implicated and claimed that the incident has been blown out of proportion.  A statement attributed to residents of the Santa Mónica accommodation said: "Despite the seriousness of their words, this is a practice which is a tradition between university residences, which has created an impression of hate and sexism which could not be further from reality."It was not clear how many female residents supported the statement, which was posted on social media. And others have given a very different view. Ángela Ruiz, a former resident of Santa Mónica, wrote: "I was one of those 'Mónica whores' and I heard these kinds of shouts EVERY DAY for the two years I was at the residence."  This affair comes as Spain's coalition government has been making efforts to promote gender equality and eliminate violence against women. In May, congress approved legislation, known as the "Only yes means yes law", making it easier for victims of sexual violence to prosecute their assailants by emphasising the importance of consent.  A study last year found that one in five young Spanish men did not believe that gender violence existed, instead seeing it as an "ideological invention". Meanwhile, another disturbing video apparently of the Elías Ahuja residence from several years ago has been circulating. In it, students are shown making what appears to be a Nazi salute as they sing the words "Sieg Heil". </Text></Article><Article author="BBC News"><Text>In our series of letters from African journalists, Ismail Einashe meets some Kenyan musicians with a cult following who are challenging the status quo.Crystal Axis, a five-piece Afro-punk band, has established itself as one of the leading group on Kenya's burgeoning rock music scene. I find them rehearsing in a recording studio at the International Trade Fair Grounds, on the outskirts of the Kenyan capital, Nairobi.One of the guitarists plays distorted riffs on his instrument with a scratchy, heavy sound as the drummer energetically beats his drums. The group is made up of Ahmed Bulhan, known as AB, on vocals, Djae Aroni and Fox Elijah on guitar, Doug Kihoro on bass and Dan Gichia on drums and percussion.Their origin lies in Nairobi's late noughties alternative music scene, which had a number of bands performing everything from indie rock and punk to heavy metal. At the time Aroni was at school when one night he snuck out of home to see a post-hardcore band, Jack the Hammer. The lead singer and guitarist happened to be Elijah. Seeing Elijah rocking it out on stage in his black skinny jeans, classic Vans and fierce punk attitude had an impact - and the next day Aroni went to school and told his friends he wanted to start his own rock band. Shortly afterwards in 2009 he set up Crystal Axis and was soon joined by AB, with Elijah and Kihoro joining in 2017 and Gichia last year.Growing up as teenage rockers and performing while still in secondary school posed its problems, says Aroni.They had to dodge bouncers at clubs who demanded to see their IDs: "We literally had to bribe our way into our own gigs."Unlike most young Kenyans who are into Afrobeats or hip-hop, the raw energy of punk rock was their inspiration.For Aroni it came from watching US group Green Day's live film Bullet in a Bible and seeing lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong holding his crotch while gyrating wildly on stage. He thought to himself then: "This is what I want to do."His bandmate Kihoro was inspired by listening to Scandinavian death metal, while drummer Gichia honed his musical skills in his teens playing in a local Christian rock band. In 2017 the band released their first major EP, Leopold - a commentary on the mass colonial atrocities committed by King Leopold II of Belgium in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo. Since then they have released three more EPs that have garnered them a devoted following in Kenya and internationally - people drawn to their bold, infectious and distinctly punk rock sound. Their lyrics, in English and a smattering of Swahili, are highly political and delve into everything from colonial history and corruption to racism. "[We want to] tell African stories from an African perspective," Aroni says.Their hit single Nyayo House addresses the legacy of Daniel arap Moi, Kenya's longest-serving president, who led what became known as the "Nyayo regime". The raging lyrics shine a light on a harrowing aspect of Kenyan oppression and are an indictment of an era when there was no freedom of expression in the East African nation.Nyayo House is a high-rise government building in central Nairobi infamous for its torture chambers used for opponents of Moi, who was in power from 1978 to 2002. "We are dissidents… Nyayo is sickening," scream the lyrics of the song, which AB says is about "generational trauma" and the need for Kenyans to speak about this history. In August Crystal Axis released their latest EP, Black AF, a celebration of contemporary African identities.It draws on their own experiences as young black Africans who contend with various challenges such as corruption, but is also a celebration of their strength, talent and creativity. The band also wants to use the power of punk rock music to create a space for young Kenyans to make this music on their own terms.Another aspiration is to reclaim punk rock history, which they say has been "whitewashed" and the contribution of black punk artists often forgotten. Aroni gives the example of black pioneers like Death, a proto punk band founded in Detroit in 1971, which tends not to be credited for its development of the early punk sound.In the late 1970s punk heyday other black bands also played an important role in the explosive growth of the genre with groups such as Pure Hell, formed in Philadelphia in 1974, and X-Ray Spex, formed in London in 1976 by the Somali-British punk pioneer Poly Styrene.As part of their efforts to challenge the image of punk rock music as a genre dominated by white, male bands, Crystal Axis was meant to play at the Decolonise Fest in the UK last month.The festival celebrates punk music by people of colour, but the band members were denied visas to enter the UK - much to their outrage and disappointment as they had sold out shows in Leeds, Manchester and London. But this has not dented their ambition - and they see punk rock as a powerful means to channel their rage, intellectual curiosity, joy and hopes.In the recent Kenyan elections the majority of the band members did not vote, with Kihoro saying Kenyan politics is "full of old men".Aroni agrees, adding that most young Kenyans feel powerless to alter the political landscape: "We are disenfranchised. There's nothing we can do."Yet Crystal Axis' lyrics are a warning that young people should not be ignored.Their 2020 song Take The Throne about "over policing" in Kenya and the violence of the state explodes with words: "Send your soldiers, send your mob. We're 50 million, and we're tenfold strong."Rip it down! We'll build again from scratch.

It focussed its attention on two permanent members of the UN Security Council: China and Russia.The Human Rights Council is the world's top human rights body. Its mandate is to promote human rights everywhere, to condemn violations everywhere, without fear or favour.The council has done some excellent work. Its commission of inquiry for Syria has produced painstaking, forensic reports several times a year since that long conflict began in 2011. The fact-finding mission for Myanmar reported in graphic detail the suffering of the Rohingya community, and made it clear that Myanmar's ruling junta were responsible.Of course, no country, big or small, likes sitting on the council's naughty step, and they all try to avoid it. But some succeed, and others do not.  This week, China succeeded, to the bitter disappointment of human rights groups.In August, minutes before she left office, the outgoing UN Human Rights Commissioner Michelle Bachelet finally published her report on violations against Uyghur Muslims in China's Xinjiang province. As many rights activists had predicted, it contained evidence of widespread abuse, from arbitrary detention, to forced labour, to torture. Abuse which could amount, Ms Bachelet said, to crimes against humanity.Torture claims against China Uyghurs credible - UNWho are the Uyghurs? 'Don't turn a blind eye to Uyghur suffering'The logical next step after a report like that is a debate at the Human Rights Council, the appointment of a special expert to monitor the country concerned, or even a full-blown commission of inquiry. Western diplomats, led by the US and the UK, took a minimalist approach and asked only for a debate, and they lost.China lobbied hard, especially among African countries which have benefitted from Beijing's investment. Its ambassador suggested most of the world was weary of the west's "political manipulation". It's us today, he told developing nations, it will be you tomorrow. When the votes were counted, just 17 member states supported a debate, 19 rejected it, and 11 abstained. Just one African country - Somalia - said yes. Most, from Mauritania, to Senegal, to Ivory Coast and Cameroon, backed China.The vote reflects China's position as a global superpower, able to influence smaller UN member states who may rely on it for economic support. But it also, as the next vote about Russia showed, reveals deep divisions about what human rights are, and who should be defending them.Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Moscow's diplomats, who once strode purposefully from meeting to meeting at the United Nations in Geneva, have been increasingly isolated. Russia was ousted from its seat on the Human Rights Council last March, and can now only participate as an observer. When this week's resolution to appoint a UN special rapporteur to monitor human rights in Russia came up for discussion, Western diplomats and rights activists were confident it would be approved.The crackdown on dissent in Russia has become ever more brutal, with mass arrests, beatings and the suppression of independent media. Russian human rights groups bravely continuing their work were looking to the UN for support.Like the resolution on China, the proposal on Russia went to a vote, and this time it was passed. "Happy 70th birthday, Mr Putin," tweeted one jubilant Western diplomat. But examine the votes, and there really is not much for the West to celebrate. Just 17 council members voted in favour, six said no, and a staggering 24 abstained. Again and again countries who abstained - India, Pakistan, Mexico, Armenia, Honduras - argued that finger pointing was not constructive. Dialogue please, they said, not blame. Sovereign countries need to deal with these issues themselves, it was suggested, without unwanted interference from do-gooders in the West.These arguments have been taking place at the UN Human Rights Council for years, but never have they been so stark. Human rights, or so the declaration of 1948 says, are supposed to be universal. The Human Rights Council is mandated to uphold, promote and defend them, and to call out violations. The member states on the council are supposed to work together, the common aim of universal human rights for all is supposed to take precedence over national interests, and geopolitical differences.Increasingly, that idea, created by those who had endured the horrors of World War Two, including Russia and China, looks like a fantasy. Powerful countries can use their power to avoid scrutiny, less powerful ones will join together to argue that they don't need any outside interference. The losers, rights groups say, will be not only the thousands of people who suffer repression and abuse, but all of us.</Text></Article><Article author="By Sam Cabral"><Text>US cannabis policy has been thrust to the fore after President Joe Biden issued a blanket pardon for Americans federally convicted of possessing small amounts of the drug.Mr Biden also urged governors to do likewise on state offences and called for a review on whether cannabis should be listed as a less serious drug.Federal law currently classifies cannabis as a Schedule I controlled substance, meaning it has "no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse".As one White House official noted, that's "the same schedule as for heroin and LSD, and it's even higher than the classification for fentanyl and methamphetamine - the drugs that are driving [America's] overdose epidemic"."It makes no sense," Mr Biden said on Thursday, as he directed his attorney general and health secretary to oversee a review."Too many lives have been upended because of our failed approach to marijuana. It's time that we right these wrongs."The news came as a surprise to many, but it has set cannabis stocks ablaze. Advocates say the move is a first - albeit overdue - step to bringing a $33bn (£30bn) industry out of the shadows and providing relief to those impacted by a "war on drugs" that began in the 1970s."It's a welcome conversation starter," said Kassandra Frederique, executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance non-profit."We've been waiting for some action around cannabis reform federally, so we welcome the opportunity to use it for a much broader conversation about reform."As the White House itself has noted, Mr Biden's pardons - for "simple possession" - are limited in scope. Only about 6,500 people with federal convictions and some District of Columbia (DC) residents are eligible for the relief.That's because, while nearly 29 million Americans have been arrested for cannabis-related violations since 1965, nobody is currently in federal prison solely for possession. In addition, most convictions for possession are at the state and local level, and presidential pardons only apply to federal charges.Ms Frederique argues, however, that the president's actions have "put teeth behind" efforts to relieve the perceived harms of cannabis prohibition.Organisations like hers are calling on the president to de-schedule the drug - that is, repeal cannabis from the US Controlled Substances Act of 1970 and regulate it in the same way as alcohol or tobacco."Without de-scheduling, people are going to keep facing criminal charges and be denied federal benefits; marijuana research will continue to face hindrances; veterans won't be able to access medical cannabis programmes; federal employees can still be fired for using cannabis; entrepreneurs and businesses will not have access to funding; and, banks will continue to be hesitant to offer loans," Ms Frederique said.If the Biden-initiated review does ultimately call for re-classifying cannabis, the federal government will be catching up to reforms already underway in several US states.Currently, 37 states and DC have legalised medical cannabis, while 19 states have approved the drug for recreational use. That represents well over 40% of the US population.Voters in five more states - Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota and South Dakota - will cast ballots next month on whether to allow recreational cannabis use, with at least four more ballot referendums expected in 2023 and 2024.It is a reflection of how much the politics of cannabis reform have changed over a short period of time. A Gallup poll last year showed that a record 68% of Americans are now in favour of legalising the drug.And, while Democrats and independents are far more likely to support loosening restrictions on cannabis use, about half of Republicans are also on board, the poll shows.Reacting to Mr Biden's announcement on Thursday, Republican congresswoman Nancy Mace of South Carolina gave "credit where credit is due"."I don't always agree with the Biden administration, I've been very vocal about that, but this is a step in the right direction," Ms Mace told the Fox Business Network.In fact, Mr Biden's actions represent an about-face on his own track record as a lawmaker. He claims to have never touched cannabis and, over a 35-year tenure in the US Senate, authored and voted in favour of many tough-on-drug laws.Industry experts expect that broad praise for his Thursday announcement will benefit the president and his party in midterm elections next month that threaten Democrats' control of Washington."Moving to repeal the federal prohibition of marijuana isn't just good policy. It's good politics," Paul Armentano, deputy director of the National Organisation for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) advocacy group, told the BBC.He argued that, by engaging with the matter from his bully pulpit, the president is "taking an issue that has been seen politically as a fringe issue, and has legitimised it".But it is only Congress - not the president - who can unilaterally act to amend or repeal cannabis prohibition.Bills to de-schedule cannabis and to ease the financial burdens on cannabis retailers have passed this year in the US House of Representatives - but none of these efforts have advanced in the upper chamber of Congress. That is in spite of vocal backing for certain measures by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who holds the power to bring bills to the floor but has been unable to garner enough support. "By having the most powerful elected politician in this country talking about marijuana policy and taking steps to impact marijuana policy, that has elevated this debate," said Mr Armentano."He has squarely put the pressure back on Congress, where it belongs, and said: it's up to you to finish the job."</Text></Article><Article author="By Laura Bicker in North-east Thailand &amp; Frances Mao in Singapore"><Text>Duangphan Patphaothanun is wandering outside a childcare centre, clutching a bag full of toys. The 64-year-old grandmother wants to know when she can see her grandson, so she can place his most treasured possessions with him in his coffin - the bag includes a large plastic dinosaur. Three-year-old Pattarawut is among the 23 children who died on Thursday in a gun and knife attack at a childcare centre in Thailand's north-east. A former policeman had stormed the building, killing children as young as two while they slept, leaving at least 37 people dead. More than 90 children usually attend the centre but because of poor weather and a bus breakdown only 24 of them were there on Thursday. Only one child has survived.Police say the 34-year-old attacker - a local named Panya Kamrab - killed his wife and his step-son, before killing himself after a manhunt. His step-son used to attend the centre but hadn't been for the past month. The motive for the attack is not yet known. But police said Kamrab was fired from his job in June for drug use. "When I heard the news about the shooting, I just fainted," Duangphan said. On her phone are photos of Pattarawut, taken just hours before the shooting. Like many childcare centres, this one too regularly posts photo updates for parents to see - the images show happy, smiling faces, writing or finishing a drawing. Duangphan was one of several grieving relatives who had gathered outside the centre in Nong Bua Lamphua province on Friday morning. Another grandmother, 46-year-old Nipha Lawongsechaison, says she lost both a grandson and granddaughter in the attack."I am full of such pain... [and] anger because I cannot do anything," she says. She's not the only one. Others too say they are filled with grief - and unanswered questions. "Why did he take it [out] on the children? Why kill them when they did nothing to him?" says 27-year-old Naliwan Dungkhet, whose two-year-old nephew Captain also died in the attack. He was just a month away from his third birthday. 'It's shocking' - witnesses describe nursery attack horrorThai pre-school attack: What we knowAmong the mourners was Komsan Norraburh. His ex-wife married the attacker who killed both her and Norraburh's three-year-old son, Worraphat."I was at the factory [when] my friend asked me to check the news. I called my ex-wife and son to see if they were ok but no-one answered," he said. "He was a good boy who liked to talk a lot. I'm waiting to pick up his body and see his face one last time."Many of the relatives said they had waited outside the childcare centre well into the night on Thursday, while others gathered at the police station.They would eventually be greeted by the sight of pink and white coffins adorned with gold, bearing the bodies of the children, which were brought to a hospital morgue in Udon Thani and laid out in rows. Police said the armed attacker broke into the building just after lunch time on Thursday, shooting his way past a teacher and parent outside. He was recognised by one of the teachers when he burst in.Witnesses said he first shot staff - including a teacher who was eight months pregnant- before forcing his way past teachers into a room where children were napping. He then stabbed most of his victims before fleeing.Officers who rushed to the nursery were confronted with the bodies of adults and children, lying inside and outside the building. Kamrab had appeared in court the morning of the attack on charges related to the use and possible sale of methamphetamine. He had been due to face a verdict on Friday.Mass shootings in Thailand are rare, although gun ownership rates are relatively high for the region. In 2020 a soldier killed 29 people and injured dozens more in the city of Nakhon Ratchasima. Thursday's attack comes less than a month after an army officer shot dead two of his colleagues at a base in Bangkok.Additional reporting by Suchada Phoisaat</Text></Article><Article author="By Stephen McDonell"><Text>The idea was to have China in stable and tip-top shape when thousands of delegates gather in Beijing to usher in a historic third term in power for Xi Jinping.However, the coronavirus is not playing nicely.In recent weeks, tens of millions of people have again been confined to their homes in lockdowns across 60 towns and cities and this is bringing political pressure on the man who has become the most powerful Chinese figure since the first Communist-era leader Mao Zedong.The government's ongoing "Dynamic zero-Covid" strategy is inextricably linked to Mr Xi. Its success is his success. Its failure? Well, it would be a brave person who tried to pin it on him.Elsewhere, vaccine rollouts have meant learning to live with the virus, but this one major economy stands alone, clinging to a response designed to quash every outbreak.Strict lockdowns, mass testing, constant scanning of health codes and travel restrictions have stopped China's hospitals from being swamped. But it's come at a cost - official youth unemployment stands at 18.7%. Earlier this year it was nudging 20%. Yet even in the face of significant economic and societal pressure, the government has not really turned to the one thing which might hasten an end to the crisis. While it has been prepared to enforce strict compliance in all other areas of Covid policy, it has not pushed vaccination with anywhere near the same enthusiasm.There is no compulsion to be vaccinated. There's barely a public awareness campaign.And it has stubbornly limited vaccination to locally developed vaccines only when research shows they are not as efficient as those produced internationally. It really does look like national pride trumping science.To an extent, this superpower is getting by. Nearly a fifth of the earth's population are, in one way or another, going about their daily lives inside a giant bubble. But they are doing this while people's livelihoods are being smashed.This week, rail services out of Xinjiang were suspended and many parts of the western region including its capital Urumqi were under lockdown as officials admitted they had failed to stop the virus spreading. China's stricter lockdowns have seen widespread reports of people unable to source food and medicine - but zero-Covid is affecting people's daily lives in myriad other ways too.Three years into the crisis, this is exhausting the population.On the outskirts of Beijing, workers on modest incomes live in an area called Yanjiao because the rent is cheaper. It is on the other side of a river, just inside neighbouring Hebei province.In normal times, this wouldn't matter but in the pandemic it can mean having to run the gauntlet of roadblocks to travel from where you live to where you work.In June this year, a cluster of cases saw people living in Yanjiao prevented from entering the capital, leading to clashes between police who were enforcing the border closure and employees trying to get to work.Since then, locals have been seen paddling across the water in inflatable craft to sneak into the city.At the time of writing, the border is open but everyone entering Beijing must show their IDs which are linked to health code apps.Every morning in Yanjiao, buses can be seen lined up, stopping before they cross over, so police can board and check that everyone has a clean bill of health.The delays have made the commuters of Yanjiao seem unreliable in the eyes of employers."Many people who live in this area got fired by their companies," said one woman in the queue for the bus. "And, if they find new work, they might get treated unfairly again."We take a train from Beijing to Xi'an. Upon arrival there is a huge logjam at the station, as thousands of travellers attempt to download the local health app after coming down the stairs from the platform. Then everyone has to do a new PCR test before leaving the station.Xi'an has been a driver of inland China's economy since the years when it was the start of the old Silk Road stretching across central Asia into the Middle East and Europe. These days, the city is supposed to be one of the county's top tourist draws.We meet Addison Sun, a specialist English-language tour guide and ask him how damaging the pandemic has been for his industry"Wow! For international tourism 100%," he says. "Because no one can come to China, no one can come to Xi'an."The number of domestic tourists prepared to travel is also way down. If you are visiting somewhere and a few coronavirus cases emerge, the city can be locked down. But even if it isn't, your own city can suddenly decide not to accept you back if you've been somewhere with infections. You're stranded, sometimes for an extended period, and you have to pay for your accommodation and other needs.There have been several stay-at-home lockdowns in Xi'an, one keeping 13 million people indoors for a month. So at times the sites at the home of the famed Terracotta Warriors have been empty.As his work stopped, Addison Sun says he slipped into depression."No income. This is my lowest point," he says. "And, you know, as a man, I couldn't do anything. I'd ask my wife, 'Hi darling can you give me 100 or 200 [yuan]'?"He pulled himself out of the mire one day when looking at his eight-year-old - "I have to stand up because I should be the model. I'm the hero for my daughter" - and began posting virtual tours of Xi'an online. He's now also teaching English but longs for the day when foreign tourists return.The city's Muslim Quarter, which historians say dates back to the Tang Dynasty, should be packed with visitors. Stallholders still line the streets calling out, advertising the kebabs and sweets they have, but their restaurants have very few customers. Along the narrow lanes the tarps blow in the wind where shops have closed."I paid two years rent the day before the lockdown," says Zhang Min, who runs a little shop selling the belts and bags she makes.  "We're from the countryside. We just wanted to achieve something by ourselves."She breaks down describing how she had hoped to give her mother a better life. When does she think things will get back to normal? "It's hard to know," she says. "Outbreaks come again and again."For decades, China's economic transformation has been powered by exports, but zero-Covid means some overseas buyers are sourcing their products elsewhere because of fears of disruption to China's supply chains.Dieshiqiao in Jiangsu Province, just north of Shanghai, is a hub for the clothing industry.At a small factory, staff are hunched over their sewing machines, furiously making up for an entire season of lost production following a lockdown.The bosses had started to explain their recent challenges when a man walks in and starts secretly filming us on his phone. He then goes and speaks to the owners - the interview is off."I'm really sorry. We just can't do it," says one of the company owners. While people here are legally entitled to be interviewed, who would defy the Communist Party in this way? Five reasons why China's economy is in troubleBefore the pandemic, China's growth was around 6%. Its most recent GDP figure was 0.4%. The local government knows that zero-Covid is tanking the economy and doesn't want anyone speaking about it.In a small shop selling items for bedding, a woman tells us their sales are down by half.Then another woman suddenly appears in the shop, posing as a customer. "Hey what are you talking about?" she asks in an effort to appear genuinely curious.After we leave, she returns and questions the shop owners.One of the architects of the policy which has stopped the coronavirus from ripping through China is Professor Liang Wannian, head of the government's Covid expert panel.When we speak to him, he acknowledges that China's home-grown vaccines are not as effective at stopping infection as had been hoped, but says they do prevent severe illness and death.When does he thinks zero-Covid might come to an end? "It's hard to say," he replies. "Because one thing I am sure of is, we won't kill the virus any time soon. We're waiting for more effective medicines and more effective vaccines."A key blockage standing in the way of re-opening is the significant body of people who don't think it's safe to be vaccinated.The Chinese authorities are prepared to separate elderly grandparents and young children from their families and force them into quarantine centres or lock down entire cities for months, but vaccination doesn't feel like a priority. Some Chinese doctors have even been telling their patients that they should not get the shots. As a result many analysts don't believe that official statistics accurately reflect the true level of vaccination.Professor Liang knows there's a problem in this area."Many old people have underlying diseases. They reckon it won't be safe to get vaccinated. But in fact, it is safe. We need to get this message across," he says. It's a significant admission."China has been working on it but there's a lot of room for progress," he adds.Could zero-Covid be lifted after the Communist Party Congress in mid-October? "It's hard for me to answer that," he says with an awkward laugh. "I'm just a scholar".China has successfully minimised the impact of the virus - and if it re-opened tomorrow, the disease would spread like wildfire.But, at the moment, it feels like the government is just kicking the can down the road. Remaining cut off from the outside world is coming at a cost.There are no easy options, but China can't go on like this forever.</Text></Article><Article author="By Paul Kirby"><Text>Across Europe, governments have been grappling with ways of protecting their consumers from rising energy bills, because the market has been hit by Russia's war in Ukraine.At an EU summit in Prague on Friday, 27 European leaders are being asked to back a cap on gas prices, even though several are wary of the idea.Fifteen countries want a Europe-wide limit imposed on the wholesale price of gas, while European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen agrees there should be some kind of temporary price cap.The recent explosions in Germany's Nord Stream 1 pipeline in the Baltic Sea were a clear illustration of how little European countries can now rely on Russian gas imports. Germany's gas network regulator has already warned that consumers are using more than in previous years and Italy has imposed limits on hours and temperatures for heating many buildings.Some countries warn that capping wholesale prices could affect the security of Europe's gas supply, as it would boost consumption. EU member states have already agreed other measures to protect consumers, with windfall taxes on surplus profits made by fossil fuel companies and a levy on excess profits made by non-gas electricity producers. They have also agreed on a mandatory 5% cut on peak electricity consumption.It's a start, but it's not long-term and not a structural reform. So what possible alternatives are there and could an EU price cap work?Many governments have already introduced national ceilings on the prices consumers pay for units of energy. But capping wholesale prices across the EU would be a major departure, and there are various ways of doing it.Ursula von der Leyen has proposed a series of measures to "dampen" the price paid for imports that she believes would not put supplies at risk.One of them involves negotiating a "corridor of prices" for imports from suppliers such as Norway and the US. Instead of a fixed price cap, an upper and lower price limit below current rates would be agreed with the countries involved.Norway has become the EU's biggest gas supplier since Russia launched its war - but Oslo believes imposing a maximum on wholesale gas prices will not solve Europe's biggest problem of having too little gas.Four EU countries want a "dynamic corridor" which would apply to all wholesale gas sales, not just those agreed with key suppliers. Poland, Belgium, Italy and Greece say a central value would be set and could be updated regularly in relation to the price of crude oil. The price could deviate from that value, perhaps by 5%.The Greek prime minister believes an upper limit that is not artificially low would not destabilise markets: "With high enough prices, suppliers will still send their gas to Europe, and consumers will still have reason to reduce their demand," says Kyriakos Mitsotakis.The head of the European Commission believes it is important to stop EU countries trying to outbid each other, as that only sends prices higher. She foresees joint purchasing of gas across a European energy platform, similar to how the EU bought Covid-19 vaccines. Another idea is to impose a temporary price cap on imported gas used to generate electricity. The advantage here is that this has already been tried in Spain and Portugal since June.The Iberian cap brought down the costs of wholesale electricity and saved households an average of 24.4% on their bills, according to one study, but apparently also led to increased demand. It is not clear if it could work more broadly.Italy wants to focus on replacing the existing Dutch-based TTF market hub, where prices have become increasingly volatile. Critics say the hub cannot properly assess the market value of LNG (liquefied natural gas) and can add 30% to the price of a commodity fast becoming increasingly important in Europe. EU energy commissioner Kadri Simson says work has begun on developing a "complementary EU price index" for LNG, but she has also raised the prospect of imposing a price cap purely on Russian gas. Until that alternative benchmark is up and running, Ursula von der Leyen suggests imposing a price limit on the TTF, to make clear that the EU is not ready to pay "whatever price" for gas.Last week, the German government forged ahead with a €200bn (£174bn) package to shield its businesses and consumers, bigger than any other EU country can afford.It went down very badly with several European partners. "We cannot divide ourselves according to the space in our national budgets, we need solidarity," complained Italy's outgoing prime minister, Mario Draghi.Part of the big German announcement is a gas price "brake", which would mean Berlin subsidising the actual market price. That is very different from a cap on the price paid to suppliers that each EU country would sign up to.The main risk, as European think tank Bruegel puts it, is that the German package could disrupt a European level playing field, with German business having a far greater chance of surviving the energy crisis than, say, Italian business.Two European commissioners, Paolo Gentiloni and Thierry Breton, said the German action raised the issue of how other countries with lesser resources could support their businesses and households. They want an EU-wide scheme similar to the low-cost loans provided in the Covid pandemic.French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire says Europe should respond with a lasting strategy that focuses on the principle of fair competition: "What is at stake is the competitiveness of our companies, the competitiveness of our industries."The problem for the EU is that it has an internal energy market with 27 states having a variety of energy mixes and they have to agree on a solution that works for all of them.Although the EU's storage facilities are about 90% full, the lack of Russian supplies means refilling them will prove hard. The International Energy Agency says if demand is not cut and Russian supplies are not replenished, then levels could drop to between 5% and 20%. It says EU gas demand will have to fall this winter by 9% on previous years to keep storage levels above a quarter."The most promising measure to actually bring down the average price is still the reduction of peak consumption," says Estonian minister Riina Sikkut.</Text></Article><Article author="By Michael Dempsey"><Text>South Central Los Angeles is an area that has been tarnished with a troubled image. Both Hollywood and real-life crime stories have seen to that.Carlos Oyarbide, who teaches English Language Development in South Central LA, is all too familiar with its reputation as a regular visitor. "There's truth in the violent stereotype, but I choose to teach there. It is an immigrant hub with a great sense of loyalty and community. And that community has an entrepreneurial spirit."That spirit has been harnessed at Mr Oyarbide's school, Nava College Preparatory Academy. The school was the trial site for a scheme that has pitched using the metaverse to help teach English to students with a limited grasp of the language. The term metaverse is used to describe a series of virtual reality worlds that can be accessed through a browser or virtual reality (VR) headset.The idea behind the scheme is to harness the power of VR technology to bypass traditional teaching methods and plunge students into a world of possibility in a virtual universe.The idea that VR can be used to boost learning isn't new. In 2020, a study by business consultants PwC found that through the use of VR students could learn up to four times faster than in a traditional class setting.However, the falling price of VR headsets has now made them a more affordable teaching aid.For Mr Oyarbide, the possibility of sharpened focus among his easily distracted students had huge appeal. "I've been teaching for 12 years. If kids can figure out anything it is how not to pay attention! I wanted to try something different, do normal learning from books for one period and then switch to VR." In doing this, he discovered that a VR environment swept away the inhibitions of many of his students wrestling with learning a new language.He says the technique helped them practise their language skills without embarrassment.Typical tasks performed by his students inside the VR classroom involved building a shop while working out the English language required for signage and advertising.Students would usually use the VR equipment for two or three hours a week."They can feel intimidated speaking in English, but when it's just them and a VR avatar that's completely different." Despite the positive impact VR has had on his teaching methods, Mr Oyarbide is not a starry-eyed convert to the avalanche of metaverse hype typified by Facebook's rebranding as Meta.He says there is still great advantages to a traditional classroom setting. "The old approach to teaching through books does not go away. And you're not going to wear a headset for four hours a day. But it does allow you to reduce teacher talk and create a tangible space for a student's confidence to grow."Meanwhile, Marco Vargas's parents moved to Los Angeles from Guatemala. "I'm a first-generation everything - first-generation American and first-generation high school graduate. In high school I learnt how to navigate the education system and how to use resources by myself."As part of the first cohort to go through Nava, he missed the more modern VR headsets that are now used.Instead, Mr Vargas had a more stripped-down VR experience, using a cardboard viewer attached to a smartphone and Google software.Nevertheless, he says that his high school's embrace of technology was important for his own academic development.The immersive aspect of VR learning appeals to him, but he can also be critical of how his younger generation can take technology for granted after having it at their fingertips for so long. "Yes, we are digital natives, but we lack discipline. We fall prey to distractions." Proving that he could overcome any distraction, Mr Vargas won a Fulbright scholarship to study at Dartmouth, a prestigious Ivy League university.More technology of business:How to make movies without a huge carbon footprintHigh and low-tech ways to solve India's water crisisAre we falling in love with robots?Can drumming reconnect you to your colleagues?How graphene's superpowers could soon be unleashedToday, he works for Exponential Destiny, a non-profit organisation dedicated to introducing students at schools in disadvantaged areas to emerging technologies. It was Exponential Destiny that provided the VR headsets to Nava College.Marcus Shingles runs the firm. He was a high-flying business consultant at top-tier firms where he demonstrated new technologies to business leaders, and happily contrasts himself with his students."I'm a rich white guy," he says. Now, he is helping to plot routes into technology for teenagers who had previously never considered that such a career could be possible for them. "It's clear that the internet is evolving, so we take the time students have invested in mastering platforms like TikTok and show them that developing products in the metaverse doesn't require hard coding."He says the falling price of VR headsets is a chance to make the technology more accessible.  This approach to embedding metaverse technologies in teaching attracts students who don't see themselves as tech-oriented.Many of the students that have gone through Exponential Destiny are hired to help out at other schools and expand the scheme.Samantha Aguilar Araujo, the daughter of Salvadoran parents and the first in her family to attend high school, is one of them."I didn't consider myself a tech person, I'm definitely more on the creative side, but I heard about a new class and took it to see what it was like."She became enamoured with a virtual approach to building computing programs that bypasses traditional coding techniques that alienate many of those who aren't technologically adept.Fuelled by artificial intelligence this VR method is often referred to as no-code coding.More students in the US and overseas are likely to see these VR techniques in the coming months.Exponential Destiny has projects running in four schools at the moment, with plans to introduce the system to another two in the US and four schools outside the US.Back at Nava College a former pupil, Juan Felix, has returned to take a class of 18 students with limited English through the technology maze.His students discover routes into college or a career in a VR world where they can pull together the elements of covering letters and job application forms."It is crazy. They're not speaking English as a first language and they've not been exposed to the technology before, but despite these barriers they learn very quickly," he says.</Text></Article><Article author="By Yogita Limaye "><Text>On the morning of 30 September, 20-year-old Mariam was scrambling to get to the Kaaj education centre, in Kabul's Dasht-e-Barchi area, which is largely home to the city's ethnic Hazara minority. Wahidah, her closest friend, had called her early that morning and said "Why are you still asleep? Wake up, we have the exam today." It was a practice test in preparation for Concor, a university entrance exam in Afghanistan.While Mariam was on her way to the centre, Wahidah had called again to ask her to hurry, saying she'd kept a seat for her. At 7:15am, Mariam had just arrived at the centre when she heard a string of gunfire. "Then there was the most terrible explosion I've ever heard," she recalls. "I saw boys running out of the centre, jumping over its boundary wall. A few seconds later, I saw girls running out too. Many of them were injured, blood on their faces and clothes."Mariam was not allowed into the centre but she refused to go home. She kept waiting for Wahidah to come outside. She never did. Wahidah was among the 45 female students who were killed in the suicide attack at the private coaching institute on 30 September. "She was like my sister. We shared all our secrets," Mariam says. "Wahidah didn't miss a single day of the preparatory course. Whether it rained or snowed or there was a flood, even though she lived farthest away from centre, she was always there."On that Friday morning, Wahidah's father Mohammad Amir Hyderi had left to go to his shop early. "I didn't even see her that day," he says. "She was the hero of our family, my angel. She always excelled at school. And even in a practice exam last month, she was the top scorer among 650 students. But it wasn't just that she was clever. She was so well-behaved and devout that everyone in our community loved her. I don't know why God chose me to be her father, but then why did he take her away so soon?"For hours after the explosion, Mohammad and Mariam went to several hospitals looking for Wahidah. "The Taliban were not letting us in. Finally at the Ali Jinnah hospital, Mariam slipped inside," Mohammad says, weeping as he recalled that day. "She came out crying and screaming a few minutes later, saying she'd seen Wahidah's body."  As Afghanistan's economy crumbles, it's difficult for Mohammad to pay for private lessons, especially through his meagre earnings selling vegetables. "I would save wherever I could. I'd buy less food and go without some things to pay for Wahidah and my other children's education," he said.Since the Taliban seized power last August, girls have been barred from going to secondary school in most of Afghanistan, including Kabul. Wahidah had finished secondary school last year, but was worried about her younger sisters' education. "She had started teaching her sisters all the subjects taught at school," Mohammad says.With restrictions on the rights and freedoms of women increasing under the Taliban, it has been a time of despair for millions of young women and girls in the country. "Whenever I used to feel hopeless or couldn't find the motivation to study, I would end up missing classes. Wahidah would say to me, 'I'll help you, don't worry, but please come for class,'" Mariam says.  For many girls who would have been in secondary school, the private education centre was a way out of the emptiness that filled their days. Omulbanin Asghari, 17, dreamed of going to Harvard University to study political science or economics. Barred from school in her final year, she studied as much as she could at home, and also took courses at Kaaj. "She wanted to make sure that she didn't miss out, and that her knowledge was at the level of a final year student," her brother Mukhtar Modabber said. "She used to read a lot. She was always surrounded by books. And she'd also exercise every day to keep fit."Mukhtar was also Omulbanin's teacher. He has been teaching physics and mathematics at Kaaj centre for 10 years. "Omul would always smile and joke with me and say 'Lala (brother), I'm going to go abroad and study, and then come back and work for the rights of women. You'll see - one day I'll be more famous than you,'" he says.  On 23 March, the Taliban had announced that secondary schools would reopen for girls. Omulbanin went to school, but she and her classmates were sent back in just an hour. The Taliban had rolled back their decision. "It's the worst memory I have of her. I was the first person she called. She couldn't stop crying," Mukhtar said. "Since then she would get upset every morning when school would normally have started, and in the afternoon when it would have ended."On the morning of the attack, Omulbanin was in a cheerful mood. "She was very happy. She had breakfast early, and left for the centre earlier than usual," Mukhtar said. He was at home when he received a call from his younger brother, who also works at the centre. Mukhtar was told their sister had been injured. He ran to the centre where he found out that she had been killed.The youngest of five siblings, Omulbanin, Mukhtar says, was the most loved child of the family. "We are devastated. My mother has a heart ailment, and she's in a very bad condition since Omul died."Afghanistan has seen numerous attacks on schools and places of education, in particular those dominated by the Hazara community. No group has so far claimed responsibility for last Friday's bombing, but the Islamic State Khorasan Province or ISKP - the regional affiliate of Islamic State - has claimed that it was behind earlier attacks. "Each attack affects the morale of all students, but especially girls. It scares them, and us," Mukhtar said. "But despite the danger, I will continue teaching. The people behind this violence are scared that their future will be at risk if Afghanistan's younger generation is educated. This week, I've lost my sister and so many of my other students. But I have to remember that hundreds are still alive and want an education. I don't want their future to be dark."Wahidah's father would often tell her to stop going attending classes at the centre because it was too dangerous. "She wouldn't say anything to me but she'd tell her mother that she wouldn't stop because she wanted to study medicine and serve her country," Mohammad said. 'I am just waiting for the centre to reopen and I will go back to my course. I used to need motivation to attend classes, but now it's a commitment and responsibility for me," Mariam says. "I have to continue my education, for Wahidah, for Nazanin, Shabnam, Nargis, for Samira, for tens of my friends who were killed. One day, we will win."She isn't sure when that day will come or if it will happen in her lifetime but she is certain it will happen eventually: "Maybe more of us will be killed, but we will definitely win." </Text></Article><Article author="By Sam Cabral &amp; Amund Trellevik "><Text>America's leaders are old and growing older. As part of a new series that looks abroad for inspiration on how to fix flaws in the US political system, we ask whether Norway's young MPs have the answer.Democratic President Joe Biden, 79, is the country's oldest ever leader. His chief rival, Republican Donald Trump, is 76.In the US Congress, the median age is the highest in two decades. Baby boomers dominate and millennials represent barely 6% of the body.Midterm elections this November will reshuffle the makeup of the legislative branch of government - but many of its oldest faces will remain.The problem is a structural one, according to experts.Congress prizes seniority, with the longest-tenured lawmakers typically first in line for leadership posts, plum committee assignments and other forms of influence. Name recognition and visibility gives incumbents a smoother path to re-election.Making matters worse are the age requirements. You must be at least 25 to join the House of Representatives, the lower chamber of Congress, and at least 30 to qualify for the Senate.Meanwhile, young hopefuls face financial barriers to seeking office with fewer resources, less access to wealth and obstacles like childcare costs or student debt.What's it like being elected in your 20s?How Pelosi rose to the top - and stayed thereSome believe youth under-representation has had a profound impact on US democracy. "Lived experience informs legislative priorities," says Amanda Litman, co-founder of Run for Something, a group that supports progressive candidates under 40. She claims that a lack of progress on issues young people care about, such as gun violence and climate change, have fed "a cycle of cynicism" and disengagement.Norway has the highest proportion of young politicians in the world, according to data published by the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), with 13.6% under 30. In the US, it's 0.23% in the House of Representatives and zero in the Senate.It's a similar story with average age - only the UK's House of Lords and Canada's upper chamber are "older" than the US Senate. Norway's average age is 18 years younger.Maren Grøthe became the youngest national politician in Norway's history when she was elected to its national assembly, the Storting, aged just 20 last year.Born just a few months before the terrorist attacks on 9/11 in 2001, she is one of 23 representatives under the age of 30, up by six since 2013."I really enjoy it. This is a job with great responsibilities, and I feel those responsibilities every day," Grøthe tells the BBC.The average age in the Storting is 46 and has remained so since the end of the 1990s, because while a record number of young people are joining, they are also working longer. The oldest is 77.Jonny Lang of the IPU which collects the global data says it's crucial that parliaments look more like the countries they represent. And having young people's perspectives leads to better policies. Despite her young age, Grøthe had already served two years as a local politician in her home municipality when she was elected to the national assembly.She has a wide range of tasks.  A recent week began with a parliamentary committee trip to Germany and ended with her back home to attend the opening of a new football pitch outside Trondheim in central Norway where she lives with her boyfriend.The workdays are long, and the business trips are many. Every week she commutes to her apartment in the capital Oslo.She describes herself as an "ordinary Norwegian youth" who likes both partying with friends and hiking in the mountains. But since she was elected to the Storting, there has been far less time for such activities.Grøthe believes that having so many young politicians in the Storting brings many advantages, with  different cultures and ages better represented. "We young people have life experience, but in a different way. We need to develop policies for everyone in the country."But what can she contribute to politics that a 55-year-old can't?"I have completely different perspectives and knowledge on being young today. More and more young people struggle with their mental health. I have also just finished my high school education, which is useful in the education committee in the national assembly," she says.The electoral system is one reason Norway has the world's youngest parliament, believes Ragnhild Louise Muriaas, professor of political science at the University of Bergen. Several people from the same party can be elected in the same district. "This means that an older and well-known man may be the top candidate, but unknown, young women may be nominated for the next positions on the list and be sure to be elected," she says. In France, UK and the US it's winner takes all and parties feel they cannot "afford" to top the lists with young, inexperienced candidates.The youth wings of the political parties also play a part, she adds. These organisations are a strong political force, often with opinions opposing those of the parent party.There are possible drawbacks too, says Muriaas. She is looking into whether young politicians disappear more quickly from politics. The lack of life and work experiences before being elected is another open question.The Norway model has not been replicated in the US, but researchers at Tufts University's Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE) suggest some developments in recent years may boost youth representation.They argue that while political parties do not typically have a youth strategy, youth organisations - particularly on the Republican side - have garnered more visibility and funding. They also point out the growing adoption of electoral measures such as ranked-choice voting, where voters rank candidates based on preference, can benefit young candidates.But because party gatekeepers often suppress young candidates, the young and civically-engaged need to be actively encouraged or financially supported to run for office, beginning at the local level, says CIRCLE fellow Sara Suzuki.Two members of Generation Z - a Democrat and Republican apiece - will appear on midterm ballots this November for the first time. If they win, they will chip away at older generations' dominance in Congress.As Americans prepare to vote we will be visiting countries around the world looking for answers to challenges facing the US political systemWe will be tackling subjects like fake news, gridlock in Congress, lack of female representation and low turnoutReporters in Bolivia, Finland, Australia and Switzerland will explain how these issues are handled where they live</Text></Article></Articles>
